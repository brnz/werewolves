<span class="tagline"><em>Los Angeles community at risk</em></span>

On August 17, two landmarks of Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo were purchased away from the original owners, East West Development Corporation, by a major investment company, 3D Investments. The New Otani Hotel and accompanying mall Weller Court were snatched away from Little Tokyo in a secretive dealing that has since caused controversy and speculation on what will become of Little Tokyo.
</p><p>
Many people worry that this new settlement with 3D Investments will change Little Tokyo into another typical American establishment; representatives and past 3D Investment purchases have tried to prove otherwise: “[3D Investments] are not going to change any concept. They value Japanese culture,” said East West President Takeshi Ito. “They are not a company interested in just making money.” In the past, 3D Investments have also purchased landmarks in San Francisco’s Japantown, and rather than Americanize the landmarks, they just gave a superficial “Japanese” face-lift. Under 3D Investments, the Best Western Miyako Hotel in the SF Japantown was altered with decorations of J-pop culture, anime and Harajuku photography. In an attempt to appease critics who think that the historical side of Japanese American culture is underrepresented in this facelift, 3D Investments plans to decorate their other SF Japantown hotel, Hotel Kabuki, in a more traditional Japanese style.
</p><p>
3D Investments has forgotten the community and historical aspects of Little Tokyo. For many Japanese Americans, Little Tokyo is considered to be home or a special place to rediscover their cultural and historical roots. Little Tokyo is a place that reflects Japanese American culture and community. Although many people who used to live in Little Tokyo for community support during times of hardship no longer have the need to live in a cultural hub, those who hold the treasured memories of the past such as Nisei Week and the different summer festivals at Buddhist churches have always come back because it represents what is close to them and the feeling of home.
</p><p>
“I’ve been in and around [Little Tokyo] working and being part of different community organizations since 1950,” said Tom Kamei, a former structural engineer, “I feel that this is my hometown. The place where I was born is gone. This is my hometown. It’s very dear to me. It’s shocking to see what’s happening.”
</p><p>
The idea of giving the ownership of these landmarks to non-Japanese corporations is unsettling to many Japanese Americans. Craig Ishii, the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) Pacific Southwest regional director, worries that Little Tokyo under the new ownership will not be able to represent Japanese American culture in its entirety.
</p><p>
“Both cultures [American and Japanese] are important to the holistic JA community. However, a community cannot simply be a collection of Japanese restaurants and anime shops. It must also include historical residents, community based organizations, community events and gatherings,” said Ishii.
</p><p>
Others are worried that the new ownership will still eventually bring more American shops and establishments to Little Tokyo. Recently, American businesses like Subway, Starbucks, and Staples have sneaked their way into Little Tokyo while a small but historically significant street commemorating the first Japanese American in space, Astronaut E. S. Onizuka Street, has been renamed to Weller Street. With these Americanized and commercialized changes to Little Tokyo, it is little wonder why the community fears that 3D Investments will aid to the fall of Little Tokyo.
</p><p>
“Little Tokyo is in danger,” said Ishii. “I see Little Tokyo in danger of further losing the sense of community that it used to have.”
</p><p>
Through it all, it seems like Little Tokyo will be made-over into a more corporate center. 3D Investments’ hopes will draw more business from many of the young and rich residents of Los Angeles, while pushing away the people who call the place home. Although people from 3D Investments and East West Development Corporation ensure that Japanese culture will be intact through the renovation and under new ownership, it is highly unlikely that the historical aspects and sense of community surrounding Little Tokyo will stay intact the way it has over the years. 3D Investments just recently purchased the two landmarks of Little Tokyo; we can only hope that they will not take away the soul and original sense of community that is slowly deteriorating Little Tokyo.</p>
