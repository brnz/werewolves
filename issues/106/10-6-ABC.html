Call for Camaraderie:<br>
Peering into the 17th API Issues Conference<br><br>

by kevin lee <br><br>

Torrential rain pour, squealing fire alarms, missing performers...it seemed like the 17th annual API Issues Conference might have been doomed from the start. But thanks to the determined efforts of the entire Conference staff, the graciousness of guest speakers from all over the Bay Area, and the interest from students and professionals alike, the Conference marched onward. <br><br>

Many students acknowledged the importance of gaining knowledge during such gatherings. Betty Zhou, a UC Berkeley freshman, helped facilitate the Session II workshop, “Asian Business in the Community.” Despite this being her first API Issues Conference, Zhou was determined to do more than attend. “I want to make an impact,” Zhou resoundingly stated. “I want people to know more about the business side of things.” Others came to learn more about the API community. Krissia Manansala, a student at the University of Santa Cruz who attended last year’s conference, came to Berkeley this year to “hear people talk about [API] issues” and to be more aware about them. <br><br>

Rain in the early part of the conference acted as a strong deterrent to potential attendees, but could not discourage everyone. Amidst a sparse morning crowd at 155 Dwinelle Hall, activist and keynote speaker Lillian Galedo talked about her fight for Pilipino and Pilipino American rights. Galedo lamented over the inability of the current US government to adequately reimburse Pilpino veterans for their efforts in World War II. According to Galedo, the US government pays Pilipino veterans fifty cents for every dollar paid to American veterans; such an unjust government policy perpetuates the idea that “former colonial subjects cannot be [Americans’] equal[s].” Galedo also emphasized that Pilipinos make up the largest group of foreign-born soldiers in the US Army’s occupation of Iraq. Perhaps most telling in her lecture was one slip-up, when she nearly referred to the war in Iraq as another infamous war: “I was going to say ‘[the war] in Vietnam’...it feels like the same.” <br><br>
Despite her sobering observation of the current political landscape, Galedo remained upbeat about potential change through young people. “You build commitment through organizations, step-by-step,” she explained after her speech. Brian Tom, a former collaborator with Galedo during their collegiate years at UC Davis, stressed the need for change at an institutional level. He called for new viewpoints in teaching Asian American studies. “The API role is complex,” Tom said. “There needs to be some creative thinking in what should be addressed in classes. For example, globalization must be a class within Asian American Studies because current classes don’t address its impact on solely the API community.” <br><br>

Session I saw late-risers stumble into Dwinelle Hall, in time for morning workshops. The makeshift breakfast
buffet featured muffins, cereal, orange juice, and milk to help participants perk up. It seemed the Conference was gaining momentum, as the morning showers began to calm. But just when people were settling into Session II, a loud, pulsating alarm reverberated through the hallways and disturbed ongoing lectures. Students and visitors were rushed out as a fire truck charged onto campus to investigate. It was later learned that there was no actual danger, and sources claim that the pulled fire alarm was only an unwitting accident. <br><br>

With fire alarms screeching, conference volunteers quickly rushed participants to Heller Lounge for an early lunch, where a delicious buffet of Cambodian food and a bevy of talented musicians awaited. Opening act Connie Lim, alongside her band complete with bass guitarist, African drummer, drummer, and keyboard player, charmed the audience with her soulful, passionate musings about life. Braindrops, a brother duo, dropped sharp rhymes infused with protest. Lijie played a lovely solo acoustic set, melodically singing to a self-sampled beat: her own hand rhythmically banging on her guitar. Rey Resureccion and band Trademark closed out the live sessions with a stirring, emphatic set of tracks that had listeners clapping and breakdancing. After completing their preset playlist, Resureccion and Trademark launched into some musical and lyrical improvisation, much to the delight of the audience. <br><br>

Refreshed from delicious food and quality performances, participants returned to Dwinelle Hall for Session III and the eventual closing of the conference. Yours truly ended up attending the workshop “Yellow Journalism: Asian Americans and the News Media,” headed by former hardboiled writer and current Hyphen and AsianWeek collaborator Lisa Wong Macabasco. Topics discussed included the controversy surrounding writer Kenneth Eng and the impact Hyphen has on the larger API community, as well as career tips for future unemployed local freelance writers (a.k.a. yours truly).  <br><br>

Eunice Lee, a UC Berkeley 4th year, found the workshop as well as the overall conference helpful. “I really liked how a lot of the workshops were though-provoking,” she said.  <br><br>

Bambu, part of the hip-hop group Native Guns, was slated to talk at Session I and perform at the conclusion
of the conference, but unfortunately could not make it. Yet, the show went on, and the 17th API Issues Conference closed with coordinators Denise Sugita and Susan Fang receiving bouquets of flowers and thanks for their efforts. Despite the fairly moderate attendance and the chaos throughout the day, conference staff and workshop leaders managed to collect students and scholars, youths and professionals,
artists and activists, together into one gathering. What this year’s conference may have been lacking in continuity, it made up for in producing provocative discourse and practical knowledge.  <br><br>
