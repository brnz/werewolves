    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> It would be unfair to 
        categorize every member of the weblog/online journal populace as either 
        a voyeur or an exhibitionist. Most people it seems are a bit of both - 
        browsing the idiosyncrasies of others and at the same time showcasing 
        their own. Online journals, weblogs, blogs, whatever you want to call 
        them, are a dream come true for voyeurs and exhibitionists alike. Offering 
        hours of secret spying, blogs are more importantly a platform to reveal 
        the uninterrupted opinions, unmitigated genius, or mere day-to-day activities 
        of any regular Joe on the street.<br>
        <br>
        Each day more and more people fall prey to the biggest online trend since 
        instant messaging. Just last week a friend, once an adamant opponent of 
        online weblogging, started her very own journal with a disclaimer in its 
        first entry. &#8220;Let the record show that on Monday, February 17th, 
        2003, at 12:31 AM, Lisa lost all her moral integrity and started a blog.&#8221; 
        Acquaintances, strangers, cousins, even those who openly shunned weblogs 
        in the past eventually give in and start their own blogspot accounts. 
        Their reasons for doing so, however, are as varied as their font and color 
        preferences.<br>
        <br>
        Weblogs and online journals are essentially exhibitionistic. Each update 
        is vulnerable to the curious eyes of every human being with access to 
        the internet. With that in mind, some people cater their entries toward 
        the masses in hopes of achieving local fame. Others find blogs a handy 
        way to keep distant friends and relatives up to speed. Either way, entering 
        into the land of blog is risky. Anyone can type a name into Google and 
        voila, direct access to deepest thoughts, local gossip or at least an 
        account of what someone had for lunch. Not only are people baring their 
        souls online, through blogs people have access to other personal sites 
        that may or may not contain personal and/or contact information. For those 
        who are even slightly exhibitionists, this utter vulnerability doesn&#8217;t 
        matter one bit. It&#8217;s when online personas and real lives mix that 
        blogging becomes a bit tricky.<br>
        <br>
        Posting online journals makes it possible to be observed, admired, and 
        even stalked without knowing it, which is more of a possibility if you 
        live in a community where the blogs you read are those of the people you 
        go to class with. Most online journal communities are built around common 
        interests, but for students, communities often form around existing social 
        circles. Personal blog sites are listed at the end of emails and in AIM 
        profiles. Getting to know someone is expedited by access to his or her 
        blog. This may seem harmless, but in certain cases blogs are instruments 
        of scrutiny. <br>
        <br>
        The effect of weblogs is distancing in the voyeuristic sense that the 
        subject observed may or may not know he or she is being observed. Voyeurs 
        often see bloggers as bugs under a microscope, an inferior and remote 
        life. There are people out there who obsess over people through blogs, 
        both in positive and negative ways. Recently a friend&#8217;s roommate 
        developed one of these obsessions. The subject was observed both through 
        his blog and in real life during common classes. He was completely oblivious 
        to the fact that someone was following the events in his life so closely. 
        The line between voyeur and stalker is crossed when you&#8217;re able 
        to recognize people from their websites and know them on a first name 
        basis. <br>
        <br>
        This is only one extreme. Not everyone who reads your blog is necessarily 
        creepy or has intentions of stalking. Romance, yes romance, can blossom 
        anywhere and blogs are no exception. Another friend just celebrated her 
        one-year anniversary with her boyfriend whom she met through none other 
        than livejournal. They were both members of a livejournal community based 
        on a shared interest. He was intrigued with her weblog and commented on 
        one of her entries regarding the attractiveness of Britney Spears. One 
        thing led to another, they began chatting online, reading each other&#8217;s 
        journals regularly, and on Valentine&#8217;s Day one year ago, they finally 
        met. The rest is history, conveniently documented in archived livejournal 
        entries. <br>
        <br>
        Blogs have other technological advantages. Online journals are incredibly 
        useful for the website handicapped. The interface is straightforward, 
        no JavaScript or html coding skills required. Most services allow users 
        to choose layout templates and customize colors, backgrounds and fonts. 
        Give up a little personal information and privacy and stake out your own 
        little nest on the web. Blogs can even help build self-esteem by offering 
        validation in the form of comments, &#8220;two cents,&#8221; &#8220;eprops,&#8221; 
        and the like. Some people are motivated to continue blogging by knowing 
        someone is out there actively reading and responding. Plus, many people 
        express themselves better through writing.<br>
        <br>
        At a time of technologically induced isolation, blogs are neither for 
        better nor worse. They offer users the ability to live secret lives of 
        voyeurism, engaging in digital peepshows for their own gratification, 
        distancing themselves from the subject observed as well as their real 
        life counterparts. They enable a certain form of exhibitionism, where 
        those who want to be heard are broadcast uninterrupted. Essentially, blogs 
        are a new form of expression. A byproduct of this is that personal information 
        is freely available to anyone and everyone. Weblogs can&#8217;t be escaped; 
        you&#8217;ll stumble upon one sooner or later my friend, and when you 
        do, good luck.<br>
