        Anna Guo, 14-year-old Chinese American resident of Ventura County, was 
        gunned three times by a police officer on May 5, 2002. The last shot was 
        fired after she had already fallen. After 8 days of recovery from gun 
        wounds, the District Attorney&#8217;s Office charged her with felony assault 
        on a peace officer. <br>
        Upon confessing to her foster parents that she was suicidal, Guo went 
        into the kitchen to acquire a knife. The police were called and soon surrounded 
        her, ordering the distraught adolescent to throw down her weapon. While 
        attempting to </p>
      <p>comply, Guo was shot first twice in the stomach and after already fallen, 
        once in the side, by rookie officer Kristen Rupp. Rather than address 
        the misconduct, the DA brought up the charge Assault with a Deadly Weapon, 
        although Guo never threatened anyone but herself. The 8 day delay before 
        filing charges indicate attempts to displace blame, suspect Guo&#8217;s 
        attorneys. <br>
        <br>
        The Asian Pacific American community is outraged and numerous APA organizations 
        including Yellowworld.com and the civil rights group Chinese American 
        Citizens Alliance, have rallied in support of Guo, demanding the Ventura 
        County Police admit gross negligence, end its prosecution, and release 
        her immediately. </p>
      <p>National president of the Citizens Alliance Saykin Foo said of the matter, 
        &#8220;Anna may have been victimized twice&#8212;once, in an abusive home 
        situation, and again by unnecessary police force. Members of the Asian 
        American community are deeply concerned that Anna may become a victim 
        a third time.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        On Nov. 14, the Justice for Anna Campaign staged a protest rally outside 
        the Juvenile Courthouse during proceedings. The group was not allowed 
        to formally assemble outside (apparently permits are required), but was 
        able to garner the attention of the media as well as of presiding Judge 
        Brian Back, who noted the large number of protesters present. <br>
        The Campaign will focus on preparing a larger protest for Guo&#8217;s 
        next hearing on December 16, spreading the word to </p>
      <p>other APA organizations, and working towards other means of advancing 
        justice, including possible independent inquiries from the Department 
        of Justice. </p>
