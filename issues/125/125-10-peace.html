<h2>Searching for Peace</h2></a>

<p><b><i>Students Dialogue Across the Taiwan Strait Innovative Ideas to Break the Strait Deadlock and Build Peace</i></b></p>


<p>It was over three decades ago when Taiwanese folk singer Li
Shuangze held up a Coca-Cola bottle at a performance and said,
"Everybody [in Taiwan] is drinking Coca-Cola and singing English
songs. Where are our own songs?" Li lent new meaning to the term
"Cocacolonialism," a word generally used to denote U.S. corporate
imperialism in a developing country, and illuminated a key conflict in
Taiwanese society at the time: the struggle to define a Taiwanese
identity with unique cultural and historic roots. This was the topic
that UC Berkeley Professor Andrew Jones spoke about on Day 3 of the
Strait Talk Symposium, a week long series of events on Cross-Strait
relations between China, Taiwan and the U.S. The Symposium featured
speaker panels throughout the week with professors specializing in
topics concerning Cross-Strait relations, and hosted 15 student
delegates from the three countries who came together to work on
building peace, trust and reconciliation across the Strait.</p>

<p>Years of deadlock in constructive dialogue have frustrated
efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Cross-Strait conflict.
Chinese who favor reunification wait for the day that the 'renegade
province' of Taiwan returns to the mainland, and they can present a
united face as 'One China' to the world. Many Chinese mainlanders
reject the idea that the Taiwanese people would not want to rejoin
with the motherland and instead want to split ways and construct their
own identity. Supporters of Taiwanese independence see Taiwan as a
country that has struggled under decades of colonialism, variously
under Dutch, Japanese and American forces. The Taiwan they see has a
culture, history and flavor that is uniquely Taiwanese, and distinct
from that of mainland China. Today, these pro-independence Taiwanese
articulate a vision for a strong, independent Taiwan that is fully
able to assert itself as an equal nation on the world stage. A growing
segment of the Taiwanese population, a large number of them youth, are
identifying as purely "Taiwanese," an identity different from past
associations as "Taiwanese and Chinese" or just "Chinese." The search
for a voice and form of expression that is uniquely Taiwanese has led
to the emergence of folk singers like Li Shuangze, who uphold
Taiwanese identity by shunning outside influences, especially American
and Chinese pop culture. Strait Talk is one of a few efforts to bring
both sides of the Strait together to critically address the problems
facing China, Taiwan and the U.S. without infringing on the identity
or voice of either side.</p>

<p>The Strait Talk Symposium, a brainchild of a group of
undergraduates at Brown University, started in 2005 and takes an
innovative approach to the controversial Strait issue by engaging
students from the three sides in Interactive Conflict Resolution (ICR)
sessions and generating creative ideas to build peace. ICR is a
framework for conflict resolution that is based on building trust
across conflict lines, and helps participants move beyond disagreeing
with different views to understanding the other's perspective and
recognizing the basic needs of all sides. Throughout the week of
dialogue, the delegates create Peace Project proposals they will
implement in their home countries, and an official Consensus Report
that has recommendations to their countries in the political,
economic, and civil society realms on improving Cross-Strait
relations. The report is to be published and circulated among scholars
and policy think tanks in the U.S and Asia.</p>

<p>Delegates formed cross-cultural teams to brainstorm their Peace
Project proposals, and the finished plans were presented to the public
toward the end of the Symposium. The Cross-Strait Young Leadership
Plan (CYLP) group based their project on the belief that the root of
conflict stems not necessarily from history, but from a lack of
communication and isolation. CYLP's proposal is based on increasing
communication and contact between students on both sides of the
Strait, who will then work together to discuss Strait issues. Their
three-step plan begins with the recruitment of students from China and
Taiwan to set up a social network for initial contact, then meeting up
in an online conference to visually discuss Strait issues (through a
medium such as Skype), and finally to a face-to-face direct exchange.
CYLP emphasizes that children in Taiwan and mainland China were often
brought up in environments of hatred and misunderstanding toward the
other side, and communication and cultural exchange are key to
breaking these barriers.</p>

<p>A second group, the Women's Peace Ambassadors Blog, believes that
women's voices were too often neglected in Strait discussions. The
group proposed the creation of the "Strait Talkin' Honeys" blog as a
way to empower and inspire women from the three sides to get involved
in the peacebuilding process. They hope the blog will become a medium
for women to share stories, ideas and solutions to common problems. A
third team, the Relieving Forgotten Memories group, emphasizes
dispelling bias at the governmental and civil level by bringing a
human element into political and confrontational dialogue. Their
project involves collecting and recording people's personal stories
and histories and sharing them with the public to show the human
suffering on both sides of the Strait, and get people to form their
own opinions outside of government rhetoric. The last group, Peace
Seeds, believes that excessive growth and overdevelopment is an issue
that needs to be addressed alongside the Strait conflict. The team
proposed groups of people from China and Taiwan to come together and
work side-by-side on a farm to promote sustainable environmental
practices while at the same time building bonds of friendship and
exchanging ideas on the conflict. Peace Seeds holds that not every
problem has a political solution, and that human experiences are
crucial to mediating a conflict.</p>

<p>Yang Liu, a delegate from mainland China, witnessed the effect
that increased communication and interaction with Taiwanese had on her
through the conference. Before coming to the conference, Yang
mentions, she held her family's traditional Chinese view on Taiwan,
namely that it should re-unite with China because it has the same
culture and history. After working with several Taiwanese delegates
throughout the week, Liu says, "I realized how Taiwanese feel about
themselves. They want to have the right to choose what they want to
be." Yang says the most impressive thing coming out of the conference
for her was that she saw "How Taiwanese people see themselves, " and
that "They want to decide what Taiwan will be in the future. " Adam
Collardey, a delegate from the U.S., had a decidedly more mixed
perspective. Collardey lived in Taiwan for five years, and before
moving there, he was avidly pro-Taiwanese independence. During his
stay in Taiwan, Collardey's views shifted to a reunification stance.
After coming out of the conference, Collardey's views have changed
again, and he says, "It will take at least a month for me to process
everything I learned from this conference, and readjust my view."
However, the most significant thing for Collardey about Strait Talk
was that, "It moved us away from the binary of Chinese vs. Tawianese.
We focused on the process of building peace instead of just the
outcome. "</p>

<p>Strait Talk ended with students returning to their home countries
with Peace Projects and lasting connections to other students around
the world. As delegate Howe Wong from mainland China stated, Strait
Talk was set up so that "Future leaders can have peaceful
perspectives."</p>
