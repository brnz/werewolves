        This November marks the one-year anniversary of the Boycott against Forever 
        21, a popular nationwide teen clothes retailer. Twenty-five garment workers 
        sewed for the Forever 21 label in a multitude of Los Angeles-based sweatshops 
        with subminimum wages, no overtime pay, and dangerous and unsanitary working 
        conditions. Workers called a nation-wide boycott against this retailer 
        in November of 2001 alongside a lawsuit filed by 19 workers in September 
        of 2001. <br>
        <br>
        Workers have been coordinating weekly pickets and have been working in 
        coalition with other workers from other industries facing similar worker 
        exploitation. Forever 21 workers and the Garment Worker Center recently 
        finished a speakers tour going across the United States spreading word 
        about the boycott in hopes to bring a broader discussion of sweatshops 
        in the garment industry. Also, an anonymous donor helped sponsor a 45 
        foot billboard at the popular Beverly Center to coincide with the opening 
        of Forever 21&#8217;s new flagship store.</p>
      <p>Additionally, in November 2001, Korean and Latino workers at the Assi 
        Market in Koreatown, Los Angeles began a campaign to win recognition for 
        the Immigrant Workers Union (IWU), an independent worker based union. 
        With assistance from the Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates (KIWA), Assi 
        Market has fought tremendously hard to prevent this from occurring by 
        hiring one of the largest union busting companies in the nation: Littler-Mendohlson. 
        Assi Market has worked to intimidate workers, even going to the extreme 
        of firing a union supporter. </p>
      <p>This intimidation is apparent in the voting of recognition of the union&#8212;even 
        though a majority of workers are supportive of IWU, they are frightened 
        by Assi Market officials. The market unjustly suspended sixty workers 
        when the Social Security Administration mailed letters to Assi Market, 
        stating that workers Social Security Numbers did not match worker names. 
        The Administration clearly stated that workers should not be suspended; 
        nevertheless, Assi Market did not proceed accordingly. </p>
