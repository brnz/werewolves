<p>A decal is a course that you can take that is run by students from UC Berkeley. Check us out on <a href="http://decal.org/1159">their website</a>. If you sign up for our decal, you'll get 1 Asian American Studies field unit, which adds up to 45 hours of field work, or basically, 45 hours of some really fun <b>hardboiled</b> goodness. You don't need to be in the decal to be on staff, but why not get units for the work your doing?</p>

<p><b>Course Title:</b> Asian American Studies 97/197<br>
<b>Location and Time:</b> 20 Wheeler, Wednesdays at 6pm - 7:30pm<br>
<b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:ali_tse@berkeley.edu">Alice Tse</a></p>
<p><b>Objective:</b> To provide students with an introduction to Asian American print journalism through the actual hands-on experience of participating in the production and distribution of Berkeley's largest Asian American newsmagazine, <b>hardboiled</b>. It is a work-intensive job that requires weekly effort and dedication on the part of the staff and core aside from their usual coursework. Each issue of <b>hardboiled</b> (three per semester, 12-16 pages each) usually requires a month to complete. We will cover the basics of what goes into the publications and discuss issues in the Asian American community.</p>
<p><b>Deadline to add this class is the end of the 3rd week of instruction! So email Alice for Course Information and the CCN!</b></p>

<p>
The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to Asian Pacific American print journalism through the actual hands-on experience of participating in the production and distribution of an APA newsmagazine. In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, students will research and develop story ideas, compose layout articles, and distribute issues to students, faculty, and community members. Students will participate in weekly workshops that cover topics including APA history, health in the APA community, APAs in law and politics, and APAs in the media as well as current and pertinent issues in the campus, local, national, and international community. As a 97/197 field studies course, students will receive an introduction to the local and campus Asian Pacific American communities by providing them with opportunities to meet community leaders, attending and participating in community organization events, and by being a part of UC Berkeley’s Asian Pacific American Coalition, a coalition of APA organizations on campus. hardboiled not only produces over 4,500 copies per semester of a professional newsmagazine covering relevant, timely, and insightful topics, but also provides staff with a community of like-minded student active in the APA community. At the conclusion of the course, students will have learned the ins and outs of print journalism, increased their political awareness of APA issues, and received experience working within the APA community.
