    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> Current attacks on civil 
        liberties against Muslims and Arab Americans in particular have called 
        attention to the shocking similarities with the World War II Internment 
        of 120,000 Japanese Americans in US concentration camps. Recent statements 
        by Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.), who is chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee 
        on Crime, Terrorism Homeland Security, have echoed past justifications 
        for Japanese internment as precedence.<br>
        Besides repeating the argument of internment for their own safety, he 
        added, &#8220;Some probably were intent on doing harm to us, just as some 
        of these Arab Americans are probably intent on doing harm to us.&#8221; 
        <br>
        <br>
        Japanese American internment, first raised by the Asian American Political 
        Alliance (AAPA) in 1968 with its reprinting of the original internment 
        orders (Instructions to All Persons of Japanese Ancestry), has been a 
        thoroughly researched topic and sometimes considered &#8220;dead issue&#8221; 
        by my activists and former activists, until recently.<br>
        Tule Lake, a historical novel written by Edward Miyakawa in 1980 returns 
        to us like a mocking bird reminding us of the human rights travesty committed 
        against both citizens (70%) and aliens of Japanese descent by federal, 
        state and local authorities. But this mocking bird adds a further dimension, 
        the fact that there was resistance from the personal to the collective 
        level. The protagonist, Ben Sensaki, is a young Kibei (born in the US 
        but lived in Japan to learn the language and culture) and Boalt Hall-educated 
        lawyer. He grew up in the Florin area of Sacramento and enters camp with 
        many of his close high school buddies. His brother Gordie is a member 
        of JACL, an accomodationist group that favored internment as a security 
        precaution, encouraged cooperation within the camps and suggested that 
        loyalty oaths could be a way to create a more favorable image of Japanese 
        Americans.<br>
        <br>
        Ben loves his brother but decides to resist the unconstitutionality of 
        his situation. Because of his educational background and the fact that 
        Ben is bilingual, camp authorities apply all sorts of pressures for Ben 
        to also become cooperative.<br>
        <br>
        At one point Ben is called into camp headquarters by Colonel Griffin, 
        the camp commander, for a conversation that centered on the theme of democracy 
        and totalitarianism.<br>
        <br>
        In reply to Griffin&#8217;s question about why he chose &#8220;disloyal,&#8221; 
        Ben replied, &#8220;I have been uprooted and placed behind barbed wire 
        as a resident of this camp for a year and a half, without a hearing, without 
        charges, without recourse to the normal channels of justice. Everthing 
        I have been taught about this country is not. Everything I have been taught 
        democracy is not.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Griffin replies, &#8221;You have the nerve to insult the greatest political 
        system ever devised by man? I fought and almost lost my life for this 
        country. You refused to answer the call of your country in wartime. Are 
        you telling me you prefer to live under totalitarianism?&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        &#8220;We, the Japanese Americans, are already living under totalitarianism. 
        We have been betrayed by democracy. In our case this system of government 
        has been perverted by special interest groups.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        &#8220;Democracy has not failed.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        &#8220;If democracy has not failed, then what has failed is man&#8217;s 
        ability to truly govern himself.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        &#8220;Your talk verges on treason! The registration is a simple procedure. 
        It is a means of determining political loyalties. &#8216;YES&#8212;I am 
        loyal. NO!&#8212;I am not!&#8217; any man who chooses freely to complicate 
        his own life and situation does himself and his country a disservice.!&#8221;<br>
        On principal, Ben remains a &#8216;disloyal&#8217; and eventually &#8216;loyals&#8217; 
        are moved out of Tule Lake and &#8216;disloyals&#8217; from the other 
        nine camps are re-relocated to Tule Lake. Tule Lake becomes stigmatized 
        as the camp of the &#8216;disloyals&#8217;.<br>
        <br>
        Tule Lake depicts not only the lost of homes and businesses, the splitting 
        of loved ones, divisions between the Yes-Yes&#8217;, the No-No&#8217;s 
        and the in-betweens, and bitter personal-political feuds; it develops 
        as a story about how a disparate grouping of individuals from diverse 
        class, occupational, regional and birth backgrounds come together to create 
        an opposition that would resound again into the contemporary. <br>
        <br>
        The novel is actually historical fiction, based on Mikakawa&#8217;s findings 
        at the UC Berkeley archives as he researched his book in the 60s. There 
        was a sociology study published by the UC Press after the war, compiling 
        the daily observations of Japanese American graduate students interned 
        in Tule Lake. Dr Dorothy Swaine Thomas hired her students as they were 
        taken into the camps, realizing this was a pivotal time in American history.Tule 
        Lake was originally published in 1980 at the beginning of the Japanese 
        American Redress Movement. It has just been republished by Trafford Publishing 
        in Canada due to the renewed interest since September 11, 2001.<br>
        <br>
        Given the current climate, Tule Lake may be a posthumous blessing for 
        the Japanese Americans who resisted Executive Order 9066 to become the 
        present day heroes of those who are standing up for freedom. Tule Lake 
        portrays the desperate struggle of those young people who refused to sign 
        a loyalty oath and refused to be drafted while their families were stuck 
        in camps. Resistance continued within the double barbed-wire camp of 18,000 
        including a hunger strike, and mass demonstrations for the duration of 
        the war. Some of the younger internees resisted by renouncing their citizenship 
        and were gladly helped by the U.S. Congress that quickly passed an unconstitutional 
        law, the Denationalization Act.<br>
        Today, there is growing resistance to the government&#8217;s attempts 
        to stigmatize Muslims and Arabs by questioning their loyalties because 
        of their nationality and religion. Rep. Howard Coble and those like him 
        are the modern day contemporaries of Colonel Griffin, but the new resistance 
        has a foundation established from the precedence set at Tule Lake.</p>
