    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext">“I just want to be happy! I want to be happy right now!” scream Ernest Chin and Sam Kim, our two sad protagonists of Michael Kang’s first feature film The Motel. Ernest, played convincingly by first time actor Jeffrey Chyau, is a portly thirteen-year-old trying to become a man. Sam, played by Sung Kang, is the middle-class alcoholic trying to help him there. Michael Kang did not try very hard to avoid stereotypes, as these two embody the most represented Asian American male personas: the socially inept, dorky, Chinese kid and the whoring, bimmer-driving, Korean who smokes and drinks too much. These two stereotypes represent the two poles of Asian American masculinity, asexual and hypersexual, both miserable.<p><br>
It is not easy being thirteen, as poor Ernest can tell you. His father left the family. He lives in fear of his tyrannical mother who makes him clean the rooms of the family’s “hourly rate” motel when people finish their afternoon trysts. After Ernest clandestinely enters a writing contest where he wins an “honorable mention” award, Ernest’s mother harshly scolds him for a finish that she proclaims is worse than losing. He is regularly ratted out by his bratty sister, and to top it all off, he has an unrequited crush on the older Chinese girl down the street. Teenage-dom does not have it easy for Ernest. So when Sam comes around the motel, drunk off his ass, with hot hooker in tow, Ernest discovers his new role model, for the time being anyway.<p><br>
Cinematically, Michael Kang has not done anything extraordinary with The Motel. It pretty much fulfills all of the typical “Sundance Indie” comedy archetypes – family dysfunction, interesting characters and embarrassing situations (think Todd Solondz or the recently released Little Miss Sunshine). Perhaps what makes this film most radical is that it represents Asian Americans, but not in the, “Hey look they’re not white and they have culture clash problems!”(think My Big Fat Greek Wedding).<p><br>
In 1971, Melvin Van Peebles directed Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, the revolutionary first film in the genre that would eventually be termed “blaxploitation.” These films were a response to the typical characterizations of African Americans in cinema after the civil rights era, the so called “Sidney Poitier syndrome,” in which black characters always had to be upstanding and noble. Van Peeble’s character Sweetback was the complete antithesis. He was a take-no-shit, cop-killing sexual champion. Sweetback, (now a slang term for a large penis), was probably the first representation, and glorification, of a thug with street-cred.<p><br>
Van Peebles’ film was met with both criticism and acclaim. Huey Newton, co-founder of the Black Panthers, called it “the first truly revolutionary black film made.” I guess Within Our Gates (1912), Oscar Micheaux’s response to Birth of a Nation, does not count. Others critics argued that the film was just propagating another stereotype, one that seems fairly ubiquitous nowadays with the mainstream popularity of “gangsta” rap. Even today, this problematic dichotomy exists in the representation of African Americans, as Mos Def proclaims in the song “Thieves in the Night”: “I find it distressing there’s never no in-between/We either niggas or kings/We either bitches or queens.”<p><br>
The Motel focuses on this type of problematic dichotomy in context of the Asian American male identity, and does little to stray from the stereotypes of portly nerd and drunken sexpot. But unlike Van Peebles or Mos Def, Kang does not use the stereotypes to display a greater social message; rather, he aims to illuminate the differences between Ernest and Sam (and provide a sort of cultural context) in order to add poignancy to their odd relationship.<p><br>
Being thirteen is an awkward enough stage for most, but Ernest lacks anyone remotely resembling a role model. Impressionable youngsters try to conform to the ways of others around them. So when Sam arrives on the scene, Ernest thinks he has found his messiah. Most Asian American males can relate. As the first children born in the US, the generation/cultural gap between fathers and sons can seem as expansive as the Mariana Trench. Frustrated with relationships and life in general, some aspire to be the Asian bad boy; after all, better to be a rebellious, non-conforming badass than an asexual, parent-doting nerd, right? But as Ernest discovers, Sam’s approach has its pitfalls as well.<p><br>
Do not look to The Motel for any answers. While filial duty ultimately wins out, Ernest’s life-changing experience does not leave him any happier or closer to getting the girl. But maybe realism is really the point here. There are no easy answers for Ernest, or Sam, or any of us. All we can do is try our best not to piss off our mothers, and hopefully the rest will fall into place.
