<p> Race riots? Asians? In a surprising twist, the &#147;model minority&#148; 
  took up arms this last summer in England and battled the British police out 
  in the streets. What was their call to arms? Racism. </p>
<p> Ethnic minorities make up only five percent of Britain&#146;s population, 
  but this vociferous minority has made its dissatisfied presence known throughout 
  the United Kingdom. Over this last summer, race riots broke out between Asian 
  (the British term in reference to Asians of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Indian 
  descent) and white youths in various north English cities. The violence was 
  astonishing and unexpected for most residents living complacently in these small 
  Northern cities. </p>
<p>Early stirrings of race riots first started on Easter Sunday of 2001 in the 
  English town Bradford; the riots originated after a confrontation at a Hindu 
  wedding. Shortly thereafter a cycle of racial violence began to emerge:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i> Bradford, April 2001</i></li>
  <li><i> Oldham, May 2001 </i></li>
  <li><i> Leeds, June 2001 </i></li>
  <li><i> Burnley, June 2001 </i></li>
  <li><i> Bradford, July 2001</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The police of North England unsuccessfully tried to prevent more race riots 
  after the violence in Leeds, but Bradford was once again site to race rioting. 
  The municipal authorities of Bradford promptly cancelled a Pakistani cultural 
  festival and a British National Front sponorsed anti-immigrant rally by white 
  supremacist. </p>
<p>However, the members of the National Front appeared for their cancelled rally, 
  and violence quickly ensued. At one point, there were up to one thousand Asian 
  and white youths battling on the streets against each other and the local police. 
  In an apocalyptic vision, the quiet residential streets of Bradford were witness 
  to burning cars, looted stores, stabbings, and flying petrol bombs. </p>
<p>Two different stories emerge from the race riots of North England. Asian leaders 
  of these communities paint a picture of both community and police hostility. 
  The anti-immigrant atmosphere has been exacerbated by the national electoral 
  success of the British National Party (with an equivalent in Australia) in the 
  recent June elections. </p>
<p>The British National Party has based much of its platform on repatriation of 
  non-white ethnic minorities. One of the BNP party ideologies is that the members 
  are &#147;opposed to the growth and increased militancy of the various Asiatic 
  religions.&#148; In the Race Relations Act of the U.K, it is lawful for British 
  citizens to deny employment, to provoke antagonism, and to publicly berate Muslims. 
</p>
<p>In late July, Amnesty International issued a report advising the British government 
  to look &#147; closer to home&#148; in examining discriminatory practices within 
  its police and judicial systems. The report said that racial minorities in Britain 
  often do not receive follow-ups to their claims of police abuse and discrimination, 
  and are also doubly subject to harsher treatment by police and more severe judicial 
  punishment than their white counterparts. </p>
<p>Amnesty International&#146;s secretary-general, Kate Gilmore, put it simply: 
  &#147;Race riots do not come out of the blue.&#148; </p>
