<h2><i>princess of nebraska</i> review</h2></a>
by katherine bai</p><p>"The Princess of Nebraska," debuted last month on screens across the country ? computer screens, that is.</p><p>Wayne Wang, director of popular films such as "The Joy Luck Club" and "Maid in Manhattan," released his newest feature film on YouTube, allowing viewers everywhere to access the film for free. Garnering 200,000 views, a number that continues to grow, "The Princess of Nebraska" is able to reach far more viewers online than through limited-releases in select cities as a low-key, independent film.</p><p>The film follows Sasha (Ling Li), a product of post-revolution China, as she travels to San Francisco for an abortion. A Chinese exchange student at a school in Omaha, Nebraska, Sasha becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with her friend Yang back in Beijing. Though Yang is never seen, his presence looms throughout the film.</p><p>Sasha's recklessness drives her to shoplift, entertain businessmen as an escort, consider prostitution, attempt to sell her unborn child, and explore a sexual friendship with a bar hostess. In one poignant scene, Sasha is asked why she had sex with her friend Yang, to which she replied, "It was summer, and we were bored." Through these simple words, Wang captures the essence of the new generation of Chinese youth, one that he illustrates as aimless and independent, a stark contrast to traditional Chinese values.</p><p>While the concept of the film presents an interesting perspective on the new Chinese generation, the storyline meanders and the presentation tries too hard to be meaningful. The opening scene is long and superfluous, with only shots of Sasha's red heels. Often times, very obvious ideas are forced upon the audience, in attempt to seem insightful and interesting. Sasha's rebellious nature is exaggerated and tested in too many situations to be realistic, and sometimes comes off contrived. Her angst-filled responses in a dinner party scene are ridiculous, and make the film appear cheap and underdeveloped.</p><p>However, the film is beautifully shot, with interesting intermittent cell phone video narratives separating scenes. There are many subtle contrasts, such as a naval ring piercing Sasha's pregnant belly, her accusations that Americans cannot understand the Chinese while she herself acts like a typical American teenager, and rebellious Chinese youth singing along to traditional Chinese songs when entertaining seedy American businessmen.</p><p>Overall, "The Princess of Nebraska" is a heavy and confusing film, with the final outcome entirely ambiguous. While the themes are relevant to the Asian American community today, the film does a poor job in conveying the issues facing a new generation of Chinese youth as they enter the world with views deviating from tradition. However, "The Princess of Nebraska" is a worthwhile film to watch, with the sheer convenience of being only a click away.</p>

<p><b>Editors Note</b>: So it seems like youtube's taken the movie down. Sorry everyone :( But be sure to check it out in theatres!</p>
