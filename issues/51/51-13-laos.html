<p><b><i>&#147;Crack! Splash!&#148; </i></b>&#150; the sound of axes and hammers, 
  pounding on giant ice cubes filled with fish, could be heard throughout the 
  camp. The sound meant that today was the day rations would be distributed. As 
  my friends and I peeked around the corner, we waited patiently because we knew 
  that soon a few fish would fly our way, which we could snag and sell at the 
  market. 
</p>
<p>Sure enough, within five minutes, a school of frozen fish came flying toward 
  us. They landed on the ground with a thump about 10 feet away from us. Eyeing 
  the fish without a blink, we slowly crept towards them, careful not to make 
  any noises. We did not want the grown-ups in the camp to know that we were going 
  to steal their fish. When we were close enough, we latched onto as many of the 
  semi-frozen fish as we could hold. 
</p>
<p>The grown-ups, just realizing that three small children were running off with 
  dinner, yelled out, &#147;Hey, you bad kids! Come back here! Your mama and daddy 
  should spank all of you!&#148; We heard them yelling at us, but we didn&#146;t 
  care because we knew that we had gotten away with at least ten fish. Surely, 
  it would get us enough money to buy some candy.
</p>
<p>Such are my memories of the Napolem refugee camp in Thailand. Life in camp 
  was an experience that I will never forget. I have only memories about my mom, 
  my two brothers, and my little sister in there, since my dad was taken away 
  when we entered the camp. I still remember what he told me: &#147;Be a good 
  kid and look after your mother!&#148;
</p>
<p>When my father said that, I thought he was kidding; but he wasn&#146;t. He 
  knew that he would not be with us for a long time, and he wanted to be sure 
  we looked out for one another.
</p>
<p>&#147;Be a good kid.&#148; The words of my father haunted me every time I went 
  to the ration warehouse to steal fish. I asked myself, Is it wrong to steal? 
  I knew about the five precepts of Buddhism, and one was, &#147;Do not steal.&#148; 
  But I did it anyway because it was a means of survival. I took home some of 
  the fish for my mother, and I would tell her that I worked for some old Thai 
  lady for money to buy the fish. I knew I was lying to my mother, but it took 
  her several months to find out. 
</p>
<p>Eventually, my friends and I were caught red-handed. As punishment, I was never 
  allowed to hang out with those friends again. I obeyed my mom, and I suppose 
  my friends were punished, too. Our fish-stealing days were over. I will never 
  forget those days in the camp because they were amongst the hardest days of 
  my family&#146;s existence. 
</p>
<p>These are the kinds of experiences I brought with me to America. I never understood 
  why I was in a refugee camp, why I felt it necessary to steal fish, why I had 
  to go against my father&#146;s wishes, and for that matter, why my father wasn&#146;t 
  with me. 
</p>
<p>When a child in a refugee asks his parents why he is in a camp, he is only 
  told there was a war, and then the topic is quickly changed. When the child 
  goes to school, he is too timid to ask his teachers about what that war might 
  be. When he finally learn about &#145;the war&#146; he is taught about &#147;The 
  Vietnam War &#150; the longest war the United States has ever fought.&#148; 
  His questions remain unheard and unaddressed.
</p>
<p>The educational system is not serving the Southeast Asian communities as a 
  whole, and the Laotian community in particular. Laotians in America are invisible; 
  we are a minority within a minority population. Certain districts that are made 
  up of large Laotian populations are not serving them. 
</p>
<p>Further, there are many negative perceptions of Laotian students: Laotian students 
  are involved in a gang, Laotian girls are likely to get pregnant before they 
  reach the age of 16, and Laotian students are not likely to go to college.
</p>
<p>Last year, the Southeast Asian Student Coalition at Berkeley hosted a youth 
  summit for Southeast Asian Youth to address these concerns. The students were 
  given the opportunity to speak of their experiences. At the summit, a Laotian 
  youth shared his experience with the group: &#147;the teachers think that I 
  am a gangster&#133;when [my friends and I] wear chains or sag our pants or wear 
  a letter belt buckle, [the teachers] think that we are in gangs&#133;I feel 
  that teacher will not help me because they already have that conception and 
  label me as a gangster. Why help gangsters when they don&#146;t have POTENTIAL?!&#148; 
  
</p>
<p>These perceptions of Laotian students discourage educators from helping students 
  in their time of need. This problem is compounded by the concept of Asian Americans 
  as a &#145;model minority&#146;. In the development of outreach projects for 
  minorities, Laotian and other disadvantaged Southeast Asian groups are lumped 
  together with other Asians, who, coming from many different backgrounds, are 
  often successful and, in some cases, affluent in California. As a result, Laotians 
  are left out of programs that are designed to benefit disadvantaged groups, 
  such as Latino and African Americans. 
</p>
<p>Laotian students are left with little guidance in furthering their education. 
  Most of the Laotian parents do not read nor speak English well enough to get 
  involved with their children&#146;s education. Many Laotian parents believe 
  that the teacher takes a proactive role in children&#146;s education and future. 
  
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these traditional concepts do not hold true in America. Parents 
  are surprised to find that, in America, students are left largely on their own 
  to create and pursue goals. If they are aware of the situation, the parents 
  often feel helpless to take any action because they are consumed with providing 
  daily sustenance for the family. Parents would like to be more involved in their 
  children&#146;s lives, but by the time they come home after working all day, 
  often for substandard wages, there is no way to go and talk to the teachers. 
  Most cannot afford to take a day off of work to go to their children&#146;s 
  school and talk to their teachers.
</p>
<p>The misunderstandings between parents and children, and teachers and students 
  could be improved with specific efforts. Students need to be taught about the 
  circumstances of the war that brought them here, teachers must understand Southeast 
  Asian cultures and issues, and parents must learn about American culture and 
  the importance of sharing their experiences, however painful, with their children. 
  With increased understanding and communication on the parts of teachers and 
  parents, children will be able to see the value of their past and the need to 
  function and cooperate with institutions. The education system in America will 
  not properly serve Southeast Asian communities unless a curriculum dealing with 
  Southeast Asian cultures and history is developed and incorporated in K-12 instruction.
