<p>In 1927, he was born a Chinaman into a bachelor society. On September 12, 2001, 
  he died an Asian American leaving a legacy for dynamic community. Victor Wong 
  lived a life that spanned 74 years, and as an actor, artist, poet, broadcast 
  journalist, and theology student, Wong seemed to live several lives. After landing 
  his first feature role as Uncle Tam in Wayne Wang&#146;s Dim Sum, he worked 
  with Wang again in his film adaptation of Louis Chu&#146;s Eat a Bowl of Tea, 
  in which his character&#146;s offbeat comedy and irreverence most mirrors his 
  own personality. </p>
<p>Wong acted in over 25 films, mostly as a character actor playing the part of 
  the mystic sage. As the only Asian face seen on the screen, Wong played an important 
  in my upbringing. His acting career began when I started to become conscience 
  of television and movies. His face was comfortable, almost comedic. He became 
  an extension of my imagination, pulling me into the movies he was in. It was 
  almost like he was a relative of mine whom I could be proud of and tell to my 
  friends of his success. Wong became my Uncle Tam.</p>
<p>Born in San Francisco, Wong was the eldest son of Sare King Wong, a man dubbed 
  as the unofficial mayor of Chinatown. When he was three, his family moved to 
  Locke, the rural Chinatown 75 miles northeast of San Francisco, to open a school 
  for children of Chinese farm-workers and laborers. They later returned to San 
  Francisco, where Wong grew up studying the Bible in hopes of a career as a minister. 
  His father had other plans for him though, and Wong studied political science 
  and journalism at UC Berkeley in order to follow his father&#146;s footsteps 
  as a leader in the community, or perhaps even in China.</p>
<p>His acting career began in San Francisco&#146;s community theater, and he moved 
  on to Chicago&#146;s renowned Second City Comedy Troupe while studying theology 
  at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Returning to the Bay Area, Wong was a contemporary of the Beat poets. He was 
  one of Ken Kesey&#146;s Merry Pranksters, and was the inspiration for Jack Kerouac&#146;s 
  character of Arthur Ma in his poem &#145;Big Sur.&#146; City Lights, the famed 
  Beat generation bookstore, was the site of Wong&#146;s first art exhibit.</p>
<p>Wong was also one of the first Chinese Americans in the field of broadcast 
  journalism. He worked for San Francisco&#146;s public television station KQED 
  as a photojournalist and also pioneered the photojournalistic essay format of 
  reporting.</p>
<p>Yet, Wong will probably be best remembered as an actor. When Wong was afflicted 
  with facial-paralyzing Bell&#146;s palsy, he decided to go back into theater. 
  He returned to the stage with the Asian American Theater Company in San Francisco 
  before going on to Broadway to act in David Henry Hwang&#146;s play, Family 
  Devotions. </p>
<p>Wong&#146;s life was captured in the 1997 independent My America... Or Honk 
  if You Love Buddha. In this film, Wong reveals his life in a nutshell, by contrasting 
  his with the lives of other Asian Americans. Although Wong never won an Oscar, 
  his work has certainly been significant to the Asian American community.</p>
