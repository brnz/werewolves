    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext">“What are you?” is a question familiar to Asian Americans and multiracial people alike. Whether you are just trying to make small talk before class or getting to know your dorm mates a little more intimately, this question will eventually come up in the conversation and it does not always entail a simple one-word answer. For Hapas, or people "of mixed racial descent with partial roots in Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry," this question poses a constant life struggle, especially in a nation where race is so socially embedded. Part Asian, 100% Hapa, by Kip Fulbeck, hit the market this past year with a boom. Fulbeck introduces Hapa identity to mainstream culture, provides a basis of understanding for non-multiracial people, and establishes a sense of belonging and unity within the Hapa community.<p><br>
The term "Hapa" originated as a Hawaiian word meaning "half." Its full term, "Hapa Haole," was used in reference to people with both White and Hawaiian ancestry. MTV Chi describes the term "Hapa" as "originally a derogatory term used to call someone who was part Hawaiian impure." Over time, Hawaii’s population grew more diverse and the term was used to refer to all multiracial people in Hawaii. After the 1970s, the term found its way across the Pacific Ocean to the continental United States, where it garnered its current meaning. MTV Chi notes that "nowadays mixed race Asians are claiming [hapa] as their own and turning the word's negative past on it's head." The term today is, more frequently than not, a positive form of identification embraced by the Asian American community.<p><br>
Part Asian, 100% Hapa only has about seven pages of the author’s own writing. The bulk of the book is a compilation of photographs of Hapa people. The levels of multiracialism run from as simple as Japanese/Hawaiian to as varied as Hawaiian/Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Norwegian/Irish/Portuguese. Within half a page of writing, the person was asked to answer the question, “What are you?” The variety of responses make the book truly unique. Some responses exploded on the half page while others responded in two bold words. Even the author, who is of Japanese, French, Chinese, Irish, Swedish, and Sioux descent himself, replies concisely with, “I am exactly the same as every other person in 2500.” “2500” most likely refers to a year in the distant future when the possible convergence of ethnicities could occur. Kip Fulbeck is the professor and chair of the University of California, Santa Barbara art department as well as an affiliated faculty member of the Asian American Studies and Film departments. His book is evidence of his earlier research work referred to as “The Hapa Project,” where he took photographs of over 1,000 Hapas across the country and asked them to define themselves in their own written word. Fulbeck’s somewhat unconventional book format can be partly explained by the fact that his academic work had to be adapted and realigned. While the book only contains 116 participants, the project tackled a sample on a much larger scale.<p><br>
Fulbeck seems interested in introducing Hapa identity to mainstream culture, but does not present new knowledge about Hapa issues. Nevertheless, this book appeals to the reader on several levels. First, this book is a conservative step in supporting the momentum of the rapidly growing multiracial movement. It’s a far cry from declaring a single image for Hapa categorization and thus, hardly steps on any toes. It’s a fun, easy, interesting read that allows you to laugh and cry in the same sentence. Fulbeck’s portraits range in age, size, race, gender, you name it! If you look hard enough, you might even recognize Amy Hill, part Japanese and Finnish, from movies such as 50 First Dates, Cat in the Hat, and Cheaper by the Dozen. The entertainment quality of the book is evident – you can search for individual personalities like Amy Hill, or just simply flip through the book of pictures. On a larger scale, this book is a baby step for creating an open dialogue on multiracialism in popular culture. A number of multiracial personalities, including Amy Hill, have garnered enough exposure to the point where multiracism cannot be a closeted issue any longer. And while the majority of Hapas are not exactly stealing the limelight, getting Hapa issues out there in the mainstream is nonetheless key.<p><br>
The 2000 United States Census provided a major step in learning about multiracial issues. It was the first census to allow people to select more than one racial category and 2.4% of the total population chose to do so. This book provides a community for Hapas and is essential for not only multiracial people but also monoracial people. It describes the emotions every person feels when he or she cannot fit into a single box.<p><br>
Kip Fulbeck’s Hapa Project continues to expand with the momentum gained through his book. The Japanese American National Museum (JANM) located in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo featured an exhibit, which ran until October 29th, on his book. JANM, best known for its exhibits on Japanese American Internment during World War II, showcased a fresh perspective through Fulbeck’s exhibit. Since Fulbeck’s exhibit first opened in June 2006, the museum has featured specials on Hapa identity, awareness, and community, including speakers and screenings of films that dealt with Hapa issues. The expansive Miyawaki Gallery housed this two-room exhibit. Numerous photographs from the Hapa Project lined the walls of the first room. A second room showcased Fulbeck’s documentaries of his Hapa Project, as well as museum visitors’ pictures and personalized responses to Fulbeck’s question – "What are you?" The museum store capitalized on this exhibit as well. The store was overfilled with Fulbeck’s book, documentaries, Hapa T-shirts, stickers, magnets, and bookmarks.<p><br>
When interviewed by the Japanese American National Museum on what message he hoped visitors would get from the exhibit at the museum, Fulbeck replied, “I’m most interested in celebration and reclamation: celebrating Hapa awareness and identity…reclaiming invisibility, ignorance, pejorative labels, and for lack of a better term-community homelessness. I’d like kids to realize they’re not alone — maybe adults, too.” While the exhibit in itself was well intended, the social significance of the exhibit was not very apparent. The museum experience was a little sparser and a lot more intimidating than the book. The majority of the same photographs from the book were simply put on the wall, without much commentary. However, it was touching to see the community reaching out to this exhibit; every Saturday, museum visitors can get their Polaroid picture taken and were allowed to write a message on it answering the question themselves.<p><br>
There was much buzz and anticipation about the book and the relevant exhibit. However, they both focused on people who are, like his title states, Part Asian, 100% Hapa. The book and exhibit are both interesting new concepts, but they only mimic the effect of being Hapa. A nice spot on my coffee table is probably the most appropriate place for a book like this.  <p><br>
