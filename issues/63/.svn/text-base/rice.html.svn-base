        The sweet serenade of accordions drifts lazily. A dashing fellow decked 
        in top hat, coat tails, and sneakers gracefully welcomes us. Swishing 
        prom dresses sweep by and plastic flowers are strewn liberally. Patrons 
        are cordially invited for a photo op with the players before a grand banner 
        of felt and masking tape, then generously presented with a Polaroid capturing 
        the magic for all posterity. One walks over the luxurious red butcher 
        paper carpet and graciously accepts the programs served on silver platters, 
        all the while wondering what the hell happened to the stark utilitarian 
        cavern that was Dwinelle Hall a mere few hours ago. <br>
        <br>
        What happened was An Evening with Theatre Rice, the group&#8217;s fall 
        showcase. Aptly titled, the event kept up with the group&#8217;s reputation 
        for not so much presenting a show confined to stage, but creating an entire 
        experience&#8212;replete with an entertaining one hour line wait, fanatical 
        groupies, programs that read like absurd yearbooks, and a looping pre-show 
        consisting of violently amusing home videos and photos of Ricers in compromising 
        positions&#8212;the entirety of which is akin to a genial mind fuck.<br>
        <br>
        Although criticized for their last show&#8217;s straying from the expectations 
        that fans have come to demand, the group came through unphased. The result 
        was a finely choreographed, well-paced program that was a mish mash of 
        raw, absurd humor and unapologetic earnestness. <br>
        The program began with the play &#8220;Flight of the Penguins,&#8221; 
        written and directed by Nima Aghdam and co-directed by Grace Malvar. It 
        is a tale of a botched bank robbery undertaken by a socially inept and 
        intellectually deficient character named Johnny. The play hovers somewhere 
        between an existential musing on pipe dreams and utter absurdity. <br>
        The piece could have stood to have undergone a few rounds of editing to 
        clean unnecessary lags and a slow start, but was bolstered by colorful 
        characters, a lively cast, and interesting staging. An ending consisting 
        of a giant penguin toking up could well have been the undoing of lesser 
        artists, but it was somehow managed with satisfaction. On a particularly 
        low note, this reviewer was devastatingly disappointed that no other audience 
        member appeared to pick up the deliberate Clerks allusions. <br>
        <br>
        &#8220;Dreams Onto Life,&#8221; a play written and directed by Christopher 
        Chen, was an abstract rendition of a young woman&#8217;s psychotherapy 
        sessions with a hostile invisible therapist. Although brilliantly performed, 
        particularly by the uninhibited and raw Bonnie Chang, and effectively 
        staged with surreal lighting and live cello and violin, the piece didn&#8217;t 
        sit well with the audience, who shifted uncomfortably and occasionally 
        emitted inappropriate giggles. <br>
        Two individual pieces, &#8220;Story Time with Joyce,&#8221; written and 
        performed by Joyce Corpuz Narvaez, and &#8220;The Demise of the Butterfly,&#8221; 
        performed by Julia Cho, were particular high points of the evening. Both 
        addressed issues of identity as an API woman. <br>
        <br>
        &#8220;Story Time with Joyce&#8221; was told from the perspective of the 
        young Joyce telling the tales of an older &#8220;fictional&#8221; Joyce. 
        The delivery was charismatic, simultaneously tongue-in-cheek and brutally 
        earnest, relating anecdotes of societal ignorance and family&#8217;s poignancy. 
        <br>
        <br>
        &#8220;Demise of the Butterfly&#8221; began with Cho kneeling, in geisha 
        costume, and delivering lines from Madame Butterfly. The act quickly progresses 
        to denouncements of Giacomo Puccini as amongst the earliest Asian fetishists, 
        Captain Pinkerton as the apt characterization of the West&#8217;s &#8220;international 
        rape mentality,&#8221; and the relentless exotification of both the East 
        and of women, as a passive mystique to be bombastically prodded by the 
        show of big guns. The subject matter runs the risk of becoming a trite 
        lecture, fodder for lower division Asian Am classes. Cho&#8217;s experienced 
        delivery, however, transcends the gamut. <br>
        <br>
        These individual pieces seem to be where the general pizzazz of Theatre 
        Rice culminates into a particularly incisive and illuminating edge. While 
        the group&#8217;s collective charisma and affinity for the big and the 
        elaborate win over crowds by the hundreds, continuing to foster individual 
        voices can add powerful new dimensions to their repertoire. The clarity 
        of a single voice can sometimes better surmount the task of addressing 
        the monumental and entangled subjects of Identity, Art, Politics, and 
        Other Important Things, with a far greater power than the loudest cacophony. 
        <br>
        In the true tradition of sketch performance, the audience was treated 
        to the pop-rap sounds of All Real, the musical guest performers, who roused 
        the crowds to climaxing proportions. <br>
        However, the real zenith was the much anticipated, collaborative Theatre 
        Rice Comedy Troupe, directed by Shalini Samat, rounding up the evening 
        with five sketches. Notable highlights included Elimigrate, in which four 
        immigrant women from various ends of the earth battle for the heart of 
        the greasy, chauvinist INS, via picking cabbages and cleaning houses; 
        A Nursery Divided, which can only be described as the Muppet Babies contemplating 
        race relations (replete with Nanny&#8217;s giant stockinged legs); and 
        Tele-BEARS, a disturbing portrayal of the demented wasteland on the other 
        end of the registration phone line, with guest appearance by the Info-Bear. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This Comedy Troupe is Theatre Rice at its natural element: a return to 
        relentless satire, outrageous caricature, and a voracity that leaves no 
        issue too sensitive (or mundane) to take a rip at. <br>
        <br>
        The high expectations of fans on Theatre Rice span demands ranging from 
        the crude, to the sublime, to high social commentary, to all of the above. 
        The group could have made it easier on itself by long ago setting the 
        bar lower and no one would have noticed. From its long ago roots accompanied 
        by accusations of misogyny and toilet humor, the group has instead emerged 
        as a finely honed, brutally earnest, and deftly clever amalgamations of 
        bodies, voices and cardboard props. It is now relentlessly enslaved by 
        its own standard and unforgiving demands of the community. That the group 
        also has an obstinate commitment to its own members to provide forum for 
        growth, friendship, and unapologetic loyalty is the often conflicting 
        force that drives the collective works. <br>
        <br>
        It will be fascinating to see Theatre Rice&#8217;s continual growth, and 
        at the risk of melodramatic metaphors, liken its struggles as the microcosm 
        of the whole: the pull between internal loyalty and public demand, high 
        art and pure entertainment, identity and transformation, the group and 
        the individual. As artists, they are in the unique position of doing all 
        and taking the rest of us with them. </p>
