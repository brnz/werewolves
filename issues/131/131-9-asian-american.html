<h2>when asian american doesn't mean asian american</h2>
by casey tran

<p><b><i>Has the meaning of term changed since the 1960s movement?</i></b></p>

<p>Asian American. The term seems relatively simple: American-born persons of Asian descent. But for many South Asian students on the Berkeley campus, the term is a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>“People tend to think of Asian American as [East Asian]... Filipino or Chinese,” Amit Kapadia, a second-year, said.</p>

<p>The term “Asian American” was first coined by activists in the 1960s. Their intent was to create a pan-ethnic community encompassing a variety of different Asian ethnicities that would come together to address issues such as stereotypes and racial discrimination. To a large extent, this goal of stirring political and social activism within the Asian American community was achieved, as demonstrated by the formation of the Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA) in 1968 by Berkeley graduate student Yuji Ichioka. Along with the Third World Liberation Front, the AAPA and other organizations pushed for the formation of an Ethnic Studies program on the Berkeley campus.</p>

<p>With the establishment of the Ethnic Studies program also emerged other disciplines, including South and Southeast Asian Studies. But even before the establishment of the latter, the university already had a history with South Asian discourse. The Center for South Asian Studies (CSAS) was established in 1959, dedicating its study to India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and the Maldives.</p>

<p>The term “South Asian” has been considered to fall under the larger umbrella of “Asian American.” However there is some dispute about this grouping. Borne out of a purpose to include people of diverse backgrounds, the term “Asian American” has come to mean different things to different people.</p>

<p>“I would to an extent [consider myself Asian American]. But not at Berkeley; there are [many Asian] countries represented here, a large majority of them are East Asian. When people think of Asian American, they think of Chinese. It has to do with the mentality of other people. They tend to group people together as Asian American,” Astrid Fernandes, a second year, said. She identifies more with the South Asian community.</p>

<p>Although Berkeley does offer many South Asian languages such as Sanskrit, Punjabi, Hindi-Urdu, and Bengali, according to graduate student instructor Joina Hsiao there is a tendency for an East Asian focus within the Ethnic Studies program. While students have the opportunity to major in Chinese and Japanese, they cannot do so for South Asian languages. In addition, funding for the Chinese and Japanese languages is greater because they are established majors.</p>

<p>So why the focus on East Asia in our course offerings? Is it due to a lack of demand or interest in South Asian courses? Perhaps the problem extends beyond the limits of the campus; an East Asian focus can be seen outside Berkeley as well. Hollywood often characterizes Asian Americans as East Asian, but rarely as South Asian or Southeast Asian for that matter. The focus on East Asians in the mainstream media is perpetuated in our course offerings. In any case, there needs to be more focus on South Asian studies and more equality in class offerings. Having courses in a variety of disciplines is important in educating students about the unique aspects of different cultures.</p>

<p>“I believe that East Asians and South Asians enjoy a flux of rich traditions and cultural practices. Some common concepts that reverberate throughout these two cultures are the idea of respecting elders and engaging in ritualistic, religious celebrations according to the lunar calendar. The cross-cultural adaptation of Buddhism also creates some religious and philosophically similar practices and artistic depictions. We also delight in the seemingly-exotic spices in our diverse dishes and speak a multitude of regional languages,” Ameeti Mishra, the South Asian Coalition Building Director at Berkeley, said.</p>

<p>While South Asians do have cultural and religious similarities with East Asians, it is also important to note the differences. Hsiao postulates that South Asian students may not want to identify themselves with the term “Asian American” because it takes away a certain distinction. While Asian cultures do have similarities, students don’t necessarily want to be put in a seemingly homogeneous group. “People should be aware of the differences, culturally, linguistically, religiously,” Hsiao said.</p>

<p>This sentiment is affirmed by second-year Akshay Nathawat, who feels that the term “Asian American” is too inclusive. “We should look at humanity as itself. Categorizing is not the best way. Culturally, it works, but when we categorize according to look or behavior, it’s not the best way,” Nathawat said.</p>

<p>Being aware of the differences in culture, languages, and religion is an important part of recognizing individuality. These aspects can define a significant part of a person’s identity.  For instance, some South Asians choose not eat beef in honor of their religion. For them, religion is very much a large part of their identity and understanding this point is important in acknowledging their individuality. When we fail to understand the distinctions between cultures, we also fail to see people as the unique individuals that they are.</p>

<p>The tendency to think of “Asian Americans” as a homogenous group is a problem for many students. Fernandes believes that emphasizing geography in classrooms is something that could be done to raise awareness about other nationalities or ethnicities that fall under the Asian American category. “We could change what people think of as Asian geography. Also emphasizing global studies. People just need to know early on about these issues. Also mass advertising and having distinctive categories on the application process. The frustrating part is that on applications, they aren’t consistent. They have a separate group for Middle Eastern, but not for others,” Fernandes said. One way that students can educate themselves about the different regions of the world is though the International and Area Studies program at Berkeley, which comprises of prominent scholars from all over the world.</p>

<p>Categorizing leads to the tendency to homogenize a group of people, concealing their cultural, religious, and linguistic distinctions. When we fail to recognize these distinctions and fail to see a group of people as unique individuals, that’s when categorizing becomes problematic. For some South Asians, the identity of “Asian American” doesn’t quite fit them as individuals. On the other hand, for other Asians—East and Southeast—perhaps the term “Asian American” doesn’t quite fit either. The term was, after all, was borne out of a political movement in the 1960’s to fight stereotypes and racial discrimination. The question I leave you with is: does “Asian American” still mean the same thing to us as it did in the 60’s? Or has it taken on an entirely new connotation?</p>
