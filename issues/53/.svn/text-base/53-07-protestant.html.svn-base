<p>Whether you're a member of a Protestant Korean American church or not, don't 
  you ever wonder why there are so many ethnically specific Korean churches and 
  even Korean American college campus Christian fellowships in the U.S. today? 
  The Christian church provides multiple functions for its members, most ostensibly 
  in the establishment of a religious forum and social networks. This especially 
  applies to the wide Korean immigrant population in the U.S., many of whom possess 
  limited English skills. For those who were Christian churchgoers in Korea, the 
  numerous Korean churches available in the U.S. enable Korean immigrants to not 
  only continue their religious faith and practice in Korean but also allow them 
  to form friendships and social networks with their fellow Korean-speaking immigrants. 
  Even if they haven't been going to church in Korea, immigrants frequently rely 
  on the Korean churches in America for social as well as moral support.</p>

  Many Korean American Christians continue to isolate themselves from the mainstream
  by engaging exclusively in ethnic specific Korean churches and Christian fellowship
  organizations.

<p>The Korean church can also serve specifically as a cultural/ethnic institution. 
  Korean immigrants initially started the Korean church and eventually accommodated 
  the burgeoning second generation of American born Koreans with English speaking 
  ministries. Even though the Americanized Koreans are separated into the English 
  speaking ministries of the church, many Korean immigrant church founders wanted 
  their second generation children to attend the Korean churches so that they 
  are provided with an arena allowing them to affirm both their Christian and 
  Korean identity despite not being fluent in the language. Obviously the Korean 
  church does not exist for the sole sake for members to keep up with the Korean 
  culture, as the exhibition of Christian faith is primal, but many Korean American 
  Christians fear that separation from the Korean church will result in a form 
  of social assimilation through the loss of cultural ties in the church. If Korean 
  Americans desire to retain cultural ties, there are other ways to do so, such 
  as participation in the Korean Student Association as well as the numerous Korean 
  political and community organizations that exist nowadays. </p>
<p>The Americanized generation of Korean Americans today generally possess the 
  ability, unlike many of their immigrant parents, to be incorporated into the 
  social mainstream more readily. However, many Korean American Christians continue 
  to isolate themselves from the mainstream by engaging exclusively in ethnic 
  specific Korean churches and Christian fellowship organizations. This type of 
  self-segregation is reflective of how racial minorities built their own ethnic 
  enclaves in response to their exclusion from the white social mainstream; hence, 
  the establishment of various Chinatowns and Japantowns. When racial integration 
  is commonly an ideal for our society today, shared religion (in the form of 
  Protestant Christianity) among Americans of distinct ancestry should be utilized 
  as a tool for racial reconciliation rather than further separation.</p>
<p>According to David Gibbons, a Southern Californian pastor, &quot;The church 
  of the future needs to be diverse. The church needs to become a mosaic. If ethnic 
  reconciliation can't happen, the church is going to be looked upon as irrelevant. 
  There is already a cynicism about church, but the jadedness becomes more pronounced 
  when everyone looks alike.&quot;</p>
<p>The relevancy of the church in the future will depend on whether it serves 
  as an integrated mosaic that celebrates diversity or is considered to be just 
  another ethnic institution. Moreover, church is supposedly where you could bring 
  a Korean and an African American person together in the name of Christ in the 
  face of a notorious &quot;Black-Korean conflict.&quot; For the Korean Christian 
  immigrant population, the ethnic church facilitates their social adaptation 
  into the U.S. mainstream but for those who are already familiarized with the 
  mainstream, stepping out of an insular box towards racial integration in the 
  church is unquestionably a laudable process in which true leadership emerges 
  among a minority group. However, many Korean American Christians persist in 
  their participation in the ethnic specific church because they have grown so 
  accustomed to the Korean church as a result of their previous extensive involvement, 
  but feeling comfortable with segregation makes racial reconciliation all the 
  more elusive.</p> </td>
