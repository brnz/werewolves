<p>Although a majority of the population know who Amy Tan is, most are not aware 
  of the many Asian American artists and writers who have not yet been integrated 
  into the mainstream. These emerging artists find their outlets for creativity 
  and expression through today&#146;s many community organizations created for 
  the purpose of building community ties through cultivation and fostering of 
  new artists. </p>
<p>One such organization at the forefront of developing these opportunities for 
  Asian American artists is Kearny Street Workshop in San Francisco. A pioneer 
  in its mission and programs, KSW works to promote pieces by Asian American artists, 
  especially work pertaining to and documenting APA issues. The success of KSW&#146;s 
  efforts can be seen in the many programs it offers to the art community. Literary 
  readings, classes, and publications are just some of the events KSW organizes. 
  Some of its bigger events include the Asian American Jazz Festival, which KSW 
  has produced for 17 years, and APAture, a week-long event featuring the work 
  of young Asian American artists.</p>
<p> Another landmark event was KSW&#146;s 1997 project on the I-Hotel in San Francisco 
  commemorating the 20th anniversary of the tenants&#146; eviction. In fact, KSW&#146;s 
  commitment to the APA community issues stems from its direct ties to the I-Hotel 
  and San Francisco&#146;s Chinatown/Manilatown, where KSW was founded in 1972 
  by Jim Dong, Lora Foo, and Mike Chin. Its headquarters were housed in the I-Hotel 
  until 1977 when they were evicted. When KSW was founded, it filled a niche in 
  the APA community that needed attention. At that time, the Asian community was 
  starting to shape itself and address important issues such as identity, pride, 
  and history. &#147;When we started there were little or no outlets for APA artists,&#148; 
  said Executive Director Nancy Hom. KSW became a place for the voices of Asian 
  Americans and stories that stemmed from their cultural identity and social conditions. 
</p>
<p>Over the years, KSW has been able to attract artists and members of all cultural 
  communities with its successful programs.&#148;We build our participants and 
  audience by producing events that have meaning to them,&#148; said Hom. Many 
  of KSW&#146;s participants have gone on to be major figures, including Jessica 
  Hagedorn, Flo Wong, and Genny Lim. These names and others owe part of their 
  exposure to KSW&#146;s efforts.</p>
<p>Today, KSW is still committed to the APA community and helping artists express 
  themselves with innovative and educational programs. APAture, its annual event 
  showcasing the work of young APA artists, is in its third year and was held 
  September 18-29. The week-long event is one of the nation&#146;s biggest gathering 
  of its kind.KSW&#146;s Angel Island Project is currently in progress and will 
  be traveling across the country in the next two years. The program will include 
  symposia, workshops, and a catalog.</p>
<p>KSW&#146;s current emphasis on the history of Asian Pacific Americans gives 
  artists the opportunity to promote the stories of the APA experience that are 
  rarely heard of in the mainstream. In particular, KSW-Next caters specifically 
  to those between the ages of 18-35. This facet of the organization addresses 
  issues particular to that age group and encourages younger generation artists 
  while knitting ties between its members. Nevertheless, the programs of KSW have 
  always been and still are intergenerational and relevant to groups of all ages.</p>
<p>The APA art community has come a long way due to organizations like KSW. Doors 
  have been opened for more specialized groups like the Asian American Theater 
  Company, Kulingtang Arts, and Asian American Dance Performances. KSW still prides 
  itself, however, on its broader goals and the niche it fills.</p>
<p>&#147;KSW still remains one of the few multi-disciplinary Pan-Asian arts organizations 
  that stress art and community as its foundation,&#148; said Hom.Future upcoming 
  events include fiction and poetry class readings, writing for performance class, 
  and the Angel Island Project. </p>
