<p>Globalization means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. 
  It means seeing a McDonald&#146;s in the middle of rural Thailand. It means 
  seeing a child wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt in Japan. It means millions of 
  South Africans will receive HIV antiretroviral medication. But for an unknown 
  and increasing number of women in South and Southeast Asia, it means being bought 
  into the sex trade. </p>
<p>On August 20, 2001, UC Berkeley&#146;s Institute of Industrial Trade conducted 
  a symposium entitled, Sex Trafficking in the Global Economy. This round-table 
  discussion focused on trafficking issues particular to South Asia. In attendance 
  were two representatives from each of the five major South Asian nations (Bangladesh, 
  India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). Some representatives included Paul Rodriques, 
  Director, &#147;Under Privileged People&#146;s Development Organization,&#148; 
  Bangladesh; Ishwari Bhattari, Under Secretary, Ministry of Women, Children and 
  Social Welfare, Nepal; Uzma Noorani, Council Member, Human Rights Commission, 
  Pakistan; and Reverend Sister Mary Kathleen, Women&#146;s Desk, &#147;Social 
  and Economic Development Centre,&#148; Sri Lanka. The group, who was sponsored 
  by the US State Department, was in the midst of a three-week nation-wide tour. 
  Their conversation was recorded by National Public Radio. </p>
<p>A diverse collage of individuals, the group included a labor attorney, a heath 
  worker, a therapeutic counselor, a nun and social workers. They discussed several 
  issues affecting the proliferation of sexual trafficking, including globalization, 
  substance abuse, HIV infection and child abuse. </p>
<p><b>International Efforts to Combat Trafficking</b></p>
<p>Let us first clarify what the term trafficking means. A 1994 Utrecht Conference 
  resolution stated that, &#147;The traffic in persons is not only for purposes 
  of prostitution, but for a range of other activities as well...It is important 
  to emphasize that the element that defines traffic is force and not the nature 
  of labor to be performed.&#148; </p>
<p>The 1998 US Senate Resolution 82 on Trafficking confirmed, &#147;Trafficking 
  involves one or more forms of kidnapping, false imprisonment, rape, battering, 
  forced labor, or slavery-like practices which violate fundamental human rights.&#148; 
  The resolution emphasizes, &#147;Trafficking consists of all acts involved in 
  the recruitment or transportation of persons within or across borders, involving 
  deception, coercion or force, abuse of authority, debt bondage or fraud, for 
  the purpose of placing persons in situations of abuse or exploitation such as 
  forced prostitution, battering and extreme cruelty, sweatshop labor or exploitative 
  domestic servitude.&#148;</p>
<p> Sexual trafficking is those particular forms of trafficking involving the 
  violation of personal sexuality. This can be manifest in the forms of childhood 
  molestation, childhood pornography, forced prostitution, rape, or coercive sexual 
  practices. The United Nations estimates that 4 million people are trafficked 
  every year, resulting in $7 billion in profits to criminal groups. According 
  to the New York Times, the CIA reports that 45,000 to 50,000 women are imported 
  illegally into the United States every year for the purposes of sex trafficking. 
  Though accurate figures are hard to obtain for this covert activity, it is estimated 
  that 700,000 persons are victims of trafficking worldwide every year. Trafficking 
  in persons has been an expanding criminal enterprise since the mid-1990s. The 
  INS identified at least 250 brothels in the United States this year likely to 
  be using trafficked women. </p>
<p>Current movements to end trafficking had their roots in the 1995 UN Women&#146;s 
  Conference in Beijing, but were given a substantial push of encouragement by 
  American politicians. Last year, Senator Sam Brownback (R, Kansas) led a fact-finding 
  mission to Nepal, where he met with several one-time sex slaves who are now 
  in their teens and dying of AIDS. Brownback and Senator Paul Wellstone (D, Minnesota) 
  became backers of legislation that provides 20-year sentences for criminals 
  who entice victims into sexual slavery. Earlier this year, the Sex Trafficking 
  Victims Protection Act (part of the larger Victims Protection Act of 2000) was 
  also passed. The act provides funding to combat the trafficking of women in 
  the sex trade in the United States and around the world, through prevention 
  education, prosecution of traffickers, and victim assistance. Particularly, 
  the act protects women who were brought into the United States for sexual purposes 
  by providing them asylum. Victims will be given access to translators and will 
  be eligible for housing, medical care and law officer protection pending prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>Attorney General John Ashcroft commented, &#147;Human trafficking victims often 
  are too young, too frightened, too trapped in their circumstances to speak for 
  themselves. We hope to be the victim&#146;s voice, to lessen the suffering, 
  to prosecute those who commit these crimes to the fullest extent of the law.&#148;</p>
<p>On July 12, 2001, the US State Department released a Congressionally-mandated 
  report on the trade of human beings, reviewing what 82 nations are doing to 
  combat it. Secretary of State Colin Powell commented, &#147;It is incomprehensible 
  that trafficking in persons should be taking place in the 21st century. But 
  it is true, very true.&#148; </p>
<p>Powell said an interagency task force is being formed within the US government 
  to find ways that law enforcement, workplace regulators, border control officials 
  and others can work together &#147;to put an end to this abomination against 
  humanity.&#148; </p>
<p>Action must be taken internationally to put an end to trafficking, according 
  to Under Secretary for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky. Dobriansky commented, 
  &#147;This report is not a discussion of which country has the greatest widespread 
  trafficking problem, or where the most number of cases of trafficking exist, 
  but rather it is a review of what governments are doing to fight the problem.&#148; 
  23 countries were found to not be doing enough to combat international trafficking.</p>
<p>State Department officials cited the importance of the UN Protocol to Prevent, 
  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons as another factor motivating nations 
  to take stronger action to stop the problem. The United States and 80 other 
  nations signed the protocol in December of 2000. </p>
<p><b>Causes and Effects of Sex Trafficking</b></p>
<p>In the West, we mistakenly view prostitution as always being voluntary. However, 
  in several South and Southeast Asian countries, women are oftentimes deceived 
  into becoming prostitutes. Seeking economic opportunities abroad, women turn 
  to a variety of resources, including newspaper advertisements, acquaintances, 
  marriage agencies, labor recruiters, and modeling agencies. They accept positions 
  (primarily in domestic services) as nannies, maids, factory workers, and hostesses. 
  They believe they will be working in domestic labor in a foreign country for 
  good pay, but then are duped into becoming prostitutes. They may become part 
  of a brothel ring from which they cannot escape or cannot return to home.</p>
<p>Women are most often trafficked from smaller, poorer rural communities to larger, 
  wealthier urban communities, resulting in the creation of networks that recruit 
  and transport women illegally for slavery-like work, including forced prostitution, 
  sweatshop labor, and exploitative domestic servitude. Many migrants end up as 
  victims of such unscrupulous trafficking networks. </p>
<p>Often times, poverty-struck women are forced to make money in any way they 
  can, and thus agree to become sex workers not for the glamour of the sex trade, 
  but in order to get by. Young women, tired of living in rural poverty with no 
  future, find themselves ready and willing to take a chance at a new life promised 
  to them by agents, who tactfully approach the girl&#146;s parents. Many of these 
  young women have already been exposed to the dream of living in luxury as fed 
  to them through television and other mass media. Some imagine that they will 
  receive luxuries and engage in an easy lifestyle. Prostitution seems to them 
  to be the only means available to actualize these dreams. Among teenagers it 
  is also popular to follow the lead of one&#146;s peer group. In a survey conducted 
  in Bangkok, anthropologist Dilok-Udomchai found that 37% of prostitutes joined 
  the sex trade because they went along with a pattern set by their friends. </p>
<p>Negative social values that denigrate women also contribute to the problem 
  of prostitution. Asian societies place a great deal on emphasis on virginity, 
  which is to be preserved for one&#146;s husband until marriage. Yet this overemphasized 
  value has backfired. Among rape cases, young girls think that once they have 
  lost their virginity, they have lost their value. Consequently, they believe 
  their only option is to become a prostitute. </p>
<p>Economic factors are another major cause of prostitution. Girls sometimes become 
  prostitutes out of a sense of duty to their parents or to share the family&#146;s 
  economic burden. The majority of South and Southeast Asian prostitutes come 
  from agricultural backgrounds, from families without economic stability. In 
  some years, their families&#146; agricultural yield is enough only to meet basic 
  survival needs. Other families work on rented land and have to return half the 
  yield to landowners. What remains is not sufficient to meet expensive costs, 
  like pesticides and farm equipment, some of which are acquired on loan. Some 
  farming families find themselves in substantial debt, far beyond their ability 
  to repay. When the family is in great debt, the eldest daughters are sometimes 
  asked to &#147;sacrifice&#148; for their parents and their younger siblings. 
  There are cases where fathers have sold and re-sold their daughters into prostitution 
  to buy extra cows for farming. This is done in the belief that children must 
  show gratitude to their parents and earn their keep in the household. </p>
<p>Linked with economic instability and poverty is a lack of education. The majority 
  of prostitutes have had only four years of compulsory education and are between 
  ten and nineteen years old. Farmers who have had to struggle to survive economically 
  are not able to provide higher education for their children. Many families of 
  farmers do not have adequate knowledge of family planning. As a result, most 
  have large families, accentuating their economic burden. A high percentage of 
  prostitutes have many siblings, and are themselves the eldest daughters. Economic 
  factors cause further problems: the break up of families; husbands deserting 
  wives and children; and great numbers of rural, unskilled poor who come to seek 
  jobs in big cities, often with little success, as most of them are unskilled. 
  To understand the complexity of sexual trafficking, we must realize that it 
  takes a myriad of forms internationally. </p>
<p><b>The GI Syndrome and Comfort Women</b></p>
<p>The Southeast Asian prostitution industry, particularly that of Thailand and 
  the Philippines, escalated dramatically during the 1960&#146;s when the United 
  States established military bases throughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam 
  War. Several Western countries occupy military bases or harbor major ports throughout 
  Southeast Asia, namely in Manila, Bangkok, Katmandu and Okinawa. Women living 
  around these bases often earn a livelihood by working as exotic dancers, masseuses, 
  hostesses and prostitutes. Often, the GI&#146;s develop a &#147;syndrome&#148; 
  wherein they feel themselves to be &#147;helping&#148; these women by offering 
  them their &#147;services&#148; as a client. Westerners also often foster Orientalist 
  conceptions of Asian women as subservient, racially inferior sex slaves. Thus, 
  Asian sex workers serve as &#147;comfort women,&#148; giving the GI&#146;s a 
  sense of home life, love, and caring while they are abroad. </p>
<p><b>Sex tourism: One Night in Bangkok</b></p>
<p>Even after the American military bases were dismantled, prostitution continued 
  to spread in various guises&#151; bar girls, female escorts, singers, exotic 
  dancers, and masseuses. For several parts of Southeast Asia, sex trafficking 
  became a major source of economic tourism. Sex tourism is one of the primary 
  sources of economic stability for Thailand and the Philippines. International 
  customers flock to centers such as Bangkok, Goa and Manila, knowing that they 
  can expect to get cheap sex. </p>
<p><b>Mail-Order Brides</b></p>
<p>In recent years, hundreds of websites and catalogues have popped up, catering 
  to a growing clientele of men seeking &#147;mail-order brides.&#148; A chilling 
  description of a Filipina mail-order bride website reads, &#147;On the following 
  pages you will find over 1700 girls from the ages of 18 to 50 who are anxious 
  to meet you. Don&#146;t be afraid to write to a girl 20 years or more years 
  younger than yourself.&#148; Websites include pictures of eligible women, accompanied 
  by their &#147;bio-data,&#148; including their age, height, weight, education, 
  number of children and bust/waist measurements. The listings of women will undoubtedly 
  strike any reader as a Sears catalogue of priced items. On-line marketing strategies 
  include such abominable promotions as &#147;Two for the Price of One,&#148; 
  &#147;Summer Reductions,&#148; and &#147;Add Item to Shopping Cart.&#148; Undoubtedly 
  such terminology reinforces the sexual objectification of women by such businesses.</p>
<p><b>Lack of Regulation</b></p>
<p>One might ask why sexual trafficking is so unregulated. The lack of regulation 
  is due to several factors. Some contributing factors include increased economic 
  globalization and negative stereotyping about sex workers. In addition, sex 
  workers face several risks, including venereal diseases like HIV/AIDS, genital 
  herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis and chlammydia; rape and/or sexual assault; domestic 
  violence; and arrest or prosecution. But perhaps the greatest effect of prostitution 
  on women is the devalued self-conception and loss of a sense of independent 
  agency. Mr. Muniraj from &#147;Outreach,&#148; a program which caters to the 
  needs of unwatched children living near construction sites in Bangalore, writes 
  in his organization&#146;s newsletter, &#147;In today&#146;s affluent society, 
  it becomes easy to forget that there are people less fortunate&#133;people who 
  are illiterate, starving, and very often exploited by the members of a harsh 
  and uncaring world.&#148; It is reassuring to know that this dedicated group 
  of activists will not let the phenomenon of sexual trafficking be over-looked 
  by the international community, but will continue to give voice to the concerns 
  of innumerable exploited women and children in South and Southeast Asia.</p>
