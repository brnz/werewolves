<p>Trade interactions between the United States and East Asia over the last couple 
  decades have had interesting dynamics, particularly when dealing with a little 
  island called Japan. America sells its culture, especially music and clothing, 
  while Americans buy into Asian products, such as cartoons, electronics, food 
  and cars. There was also the infamous &#147;Brain Drain&#148; &#150; resulting 
  from the 1965 change of immigration laws for Asians &#150; where the US brought 
  over many of the top Asian engineers, mathematicians, architects and scientists, 
  exchanging help in their specialties for American citizenship. But when it comes 
  to athletics &#150; perhaps with the exception of Mizuno sports equipment &#150; 
  America has really never taken anything from East Asia. </p>
<p>Of course, that was before a pitcher by the name of Hideo Nomo came from Japan 
  to play in the Major League. The talented young hurler initially had a tough 
  time adjusting, as he was not able to carry the L.A. Dodgers the way they had 
  hoped. He only received a lukewarm reception from American fans and was basically 
  disowned by Japanese baseball loyals for deserting his native culture. Despite 
  this, he unknowingly started an amazing trend that is slowly changing the face 
  of Major League Baseball: the emigration of Asian athletes.</p>
<p> When this originally occurred, Major League scouts went across the Pacific 
  only searching for pitchers, which yielded a great deal of success in the form 
  of Japanese players Nomo, who is currently on the Boston Red Sox, and Shigetoshi 
  Hasegawa of the Anaheim Angels. There were also several successful Koreans, 
  most notably the Dodgers&#146; Chan Ho Park. </p>
<p>But now there is a phenom by the name of Ichiro Suzuki, an exceptional outfielder 
  for the Seattle Mariners who has single-handedly disposed of the stereotype 
  of the Asians only being Major League pitchers. He boasts a superior batting 
  average,&nbsp;fields well, steals bases and is an effective leadoff hitter. 
  Even more impressive, Ichiro&nbsp;is just a rookie. Of greater significance, 
  however, is not his game, but&nbsp;the impact&nbsp;has&nbsp;had&nbsp;on baseball 
  and how things have drastically changed since Nomo emigrated years ago. </p>
<p>Americans love Ichiro, heralding him as one of the greatest ballplayers around. 
  More importantly though, is that Japanese fans also love him, as he is now a 
  grander sports icon now that he is in the US than when he was in Japan. The 
  Mariners&#146; games are all televised in Japan, the Japanese media hounds him 
  here in America, relaying his every move overseas, and products bearing his 
  name are everywhere. Naturally, it helps that Ichiro has been a huge success 
  and that the Mariners lead the American League West Division, being the first 
  team in the Majors to post 100 wins this season. Nevertheless, he opened what 
  quite possibly is Pandora&#146;s box, and here is why. </p>
<p>This event marks a transition in beliefs that has already begun to affect the 
  very core of baseball in Asia. Now there are many more Japanese players who 
  desire to move over to the US and take a shot at the Major League. This desire 
  is understandable since American players make much more money and have easier 
  practices; moreover, there is no longer a fear of ostracism from one&#146;s 
  native land. All in all, it would seem that the players, the fans and the Major 
  League all win. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that viewpoint is only a single facet of this dilemma. Because 
  the Japanese fans are watching Ichiro in Seattle and are beginning to feel that 
  American baseball is a better product, attendance&nbsp;at the Japanese league 
  has declined; also declining are the ratings of Japanese baseball games on television. 
  Because the Japanese players want to leave, there is a risk of Japan&#146;s 
  baseball losing too much of its talent, which could mean even more adverse effects 
  on the league. Hence there is another side to this story, where the government 
  and businessmen who own or sponsor Asian baseball leagues are against this second 
  &#147;Brain Drain.&#148;</p>
<p>So what will be done, considering that there is so much at stake? Well, the 
  answer is not so pleasant, especially considering that the same problem has 
  been happening in another region halfway around the world. For many years, Cuba, 
  Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic have lost their top athletes to America. 
  Cuba has been the primary target for Major League scouts, and though the Cuban 
  government will literally imprison athletes for attempting to flee the country, 
  there is still a steady stream of Cuban baseball players who manage to make 
  it into the US to play ball and stay as refugees. </p>
<p>Can and will the Japanese resort to such drastic measures to keep their athletes? 
  Probably not. All the Japanese can do is try to offer their players incentives 
  to stay, and if they leave, show the same support Ichiro has received. Fortunately, 
  this should not necessarily mean the end of professional baseball in Japan. 
  Unfortunately, this is the start of another &#147;Brain Drain,&#148; and it 
  could be a shock to the system</p>
