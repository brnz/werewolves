<p>Bindlestiff Theatre stands on the corner of Sixth Street and Howard, on the 
  ground floor of the dilapidated Plaza Hotel in the center of an economically 
  depressed neighborhood. Homeless children, families and seniors line the street, 
  pushing carts and huddling in blankets on the sidewalk. Amidst all this is a 
  thriving community of Pilipinos, brought together by this cultural keystone. 
  Bindlestiff is the heart of the Pilipino American community in San Francisco&#146;s 
  SOMA district and is the only Pilipino American center for performing arts in 
  the nation. It stands as a beacon of hope for the entire Sixth Street area &#150; 
  a neighborhood crying to grow.</p>
<p>Now that this area is given a chance to be resurrected from the depths of poverty, 
  the Bindlestiff community is making sure their chance is not wasted. A motion 
  before the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency proposed the demolition of the 
  current Plaza Hotel in favor of a new structure that would have included 115 
  units of affordable housing and a renovated theatre that would be the new home 
  of Bindlestiff. The Bindlestiff community has worked closely with TODCO, the 
  development firm that has offered to take on the project. </p>
<p>Recently, a year of planning and anticipation was undone in one day and with 
  one vote. The Redevelopment Agency is composed of seven commissioners, three 
  of which support the issue, three of which oppose it, and one who, until the 
  latest meeting, was undecided. Commissioner Michael Settles voted against the 
  Plaza Hotel project on October 30th, preventing the passage of the motion. </p>
<p>Watching a meeting of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency is like watching 
  an ongoing battle between public policy and the public. Benny Yee, the Commission 
  Chair, has been quoted as saying, &#147;I don&#146;t care about the public, 
  only about policy.&#148; These are harsh words, especially coming from the head 
  of the commission that controls the renovation of San Francisco&#146;s decaying 
  areas. His rejection of the motion to rebuild the run-down Plaza Hotel has become 
  an unmistakable case of &#147;Asians hating on Asians.&#148; Yee is the president 
  of a real estate company and is affiliated with private, for-profit construction 
  companies. Community members suspect that his issues with public policy are 
  only stalling tactics meant to mask his personal agenda. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the three commissioners that support the motion have become heroes. 
  Commissioners Palamountain, Romero and Dunlop continue to fight for the public 
  and refuse to subordinate the needs of the community to ambiguous interests. 
</p>
<p>The Pilipino population in San Francisco is no stranger to the struggle for 
  community space. In the 1970s, residents and activists fought for the survival 
  of the International Hotel, a complex that housed many older, single Pilipino 
  immigrants in Manilatown, and was shut down in the interests of corporate development. 
  What&#146;s Manilatown, you ask? Perhaps that&#146;s the point: in just a few 
  years, a once vibrant and very visible Pilipino community was displaced and 
  effectively removed from the collective memory of the Bay Area in efforts to 
  promote economic development. Twenty-five years later, at the site of the former 
  I-Hotel stands a vacant lot in the midst of one of the most expensive real estate 
  regions in the country. Bill Soro, a community activist who once fought for 
  the I-Hotel, now supports Bindlestiff&#146;s effort, saying at the rally on 
  October 23rd, &#147;Struggle is continual, like freedom.&#148; The Pilipino 
  community&#146;s struggle has been long and is far from over.</p>
<p>Sixth Street is an area whose growth is paralyzed by City Hall. Bindlestiff 
  is a home, a stomping ground for students, and extension of the classroom for 
  teachers in San Francisco schools and universities; a place that is a haven 
  to the ailing members of the surrounding community. Relief for the neighborhood 
  has been a long time in coming and negotiations with TODCO have been greatly 
  anticipated. </p>
<p>Over fifty of the students and community members watched the hope for their 
  neighborhood crushed on a monitor in an overflow room down the hall from the 
  actual proceedings. At the end of the meeting, the activists chanted and marched 
  through City Hall showing the commission and the mayor that Bindlestiff and 
  Sixth Street will &#147;never give up.&#148; These three words embody their 
  motto and mentality, and their patience and persistence will be tested as their 
  fight turns into a drawn out war. </p>
<p>The students that support Bindlestiff look to the past &#150; their warrior 
  ancestry &#150; for inspiration and strength. They will protest, chant, and 
  bang on drums until City Hall hears their cause. The next step for Bindlestiff, 
  Sixth Street and TODCO will be an appeal of the decision, to use sympathies 
  and support in City Hall to overcome the barriers created by the Redevelopment 
  commission, and to show with even more force that this issue must not go ignored 
  &#150; that they will never give up.</p>
