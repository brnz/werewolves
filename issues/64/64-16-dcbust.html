    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> Washington, DC is unlike 
        any city in the country. No city is steeped with so much history and simultaneously 
        with so much dynamism, reminding us of the nation&#8217;s past as well 
        as its future. Despite the 100 degree-plus temperatures in the summer, 
        the streets are filled with an unidentifiable electric energy and vitality. 
        A friend put it best when she said, &#8220;DC is a good place to be young 
        in.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        Indeed, Washington D.C. is chock full of trendy restaurants, chic shops, 
        crowded bars, and lively clubs. It is also home to some of the nation&#8217;s 
        most famous monuments, statues, and museums. It&#8217;s a sprawling metropolis, 
        much like San Francisco, except for the stifling humidity in the summer 
        and a public transportation system that actually gets you to where you 
        want to go (although ironically both the BART and the Metro were designed 
        by the same people). Given all this, each summer thousands of interns 
        flock to the nation&#8217;s capital to get a piece of the action. Last 
        summer, I was among the throngs of excited college students that made 
        the mass exodus to the nation&#8217;s capital.<br>
        <br>
        The end of my sophomore year was marked with one last final in the can 
        and an empty suitcase in the center of my room. Life in D.C. began at 
        5AM on a bright Sunday morning, following a red-eye flight and a sleep-deprived 
        weekend &#8212; a perfect introduction to the summer. Nevertheless, the 
        second I got to DC, the electric energy hit me, and I hit the ground running.<br>
        <br>
        I participated in the summer internship program of the Organization of 
        Chinese Americans&#8217; (OCA), one of the largest nonprofit civil rights 
        advocacy and education organizations for Asian Pacific Americans. I was 
        placed in the External Partnerships and Advocacy Department of the National 
        Education Association (NEA). Due to my interest in public education, I 
        was responsible for a long-term research project regarding the creation 
        of an Asian Pacific American information clearinghouse and its eventual 
        institution into the U.S. History curriculum for K-12 public school classrooms. 
        The purpose of this project would be to diversify the curriculum for K-12 
        public schools to reflect the histories and stories of its ever-more diverse 
        student body. It no longer adequate just to learn about the Founding Fathers 
        and not to recognize the contributions of people of color to the building 
        of our nation.<br>
        <br>
        Things unrelated to my immediate duties as an NEA intern also colored 
        my internship program. In addition to the 24 Asian Pacific American students 
        who were also OCA interns, I was fortunate to meet other Asian Pacific 
        American interns who worked through other programs such as the Asian Pacific 
        American Institute of Congressional Studies (APAICS), the National Asian 
        Pacific Legal Consortium (NAPALC), and the Southeast Asia Resource Action 
        Center (SEARAC). I attended various workshops and seminars regarding national 
        Asian Pacific American issues. Every week, there was a brown bag luncheon 
        held in one of the offices in the Capital where all of the interns from 
        the different organizations sat down to presentations about current issues 
        that affect our communities. We discussed hate crimes, the 20th anniversary 
        of the death of Vincent Chin, coalition building with other minority groups, 
        expanding educational curriculum to include minority groups, labor issues, 
        and college activism. There were also weekly events hosted by the Conference 
        on Asian Pacific American Leadership (CAPAL), which focused on career 
        paths, goals, and leadership. <br>
        <br>
        From press conferences and congressional visits to organizational meetings, 
        the workday always moved in a blur from one place to the next. At the 
        end of an exhausting day, interns know how to go out and let loose! Goodbye 
        suits and polite demeanor, hello DC nightlife! Sharing a house with six 
        fellow interns, we always found something to explore in the city. One 
        of our favorite haunts was the club scene. Many clubs were accessible 
        by Metro, and free or discounted before a certain time (small Intern budget=creativity). 
        There were also happy hours and socials hosted by various colleges and 
        universities. Rumor has it that there are more bars in DC than restaurants, 
        and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if that were true. Aside from the attractions 
        in the city, you can visit nearby cities on the East Coast such as Philadelphia, 
        New York, and Boston on long weekends. <br>
        <br>
        I have benefited tremendously from the experience from my experience in 
        DC, and there are scores of reasons why I encourage other college students 
        to participate in a summer internship in Washington, DC. During an internship 
        in DC, you will gain valuable experience in a field that you may enter 
        into after graduation. Whatever your interests, and wherever your passions 
        lie, there is a place in Washington, DC to suit them. One of the great 
        things about internships is that they are offered in a diverse array of 
        professions and organizations, and they do not require previous experience. 
        For example, if you are interested in medicine and healthcare, you can 
        intern at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. If you&#8217;re 
        worried about national security, get the inside scoop by interning at 
        the FBI or the National Security Administration (NSA). To explore your 
        concerns about the current state of civil rights, you can investigate 
        the work done by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the Equal Employment 
        Opportunity Commission. If you want to contribute to the public education 
        system, the NEA and Department of Education are in the political process 
        itself, you can intern on the Hill at your congressperson&#8217;s national 
        office. In addition to internships offered in government offices, you 
        will also find a plethora of non-profit and for-profit organizations that 
        have headquarters in the nation&#8217;s capital, including newsrooms, 
        National Geographic Magazine, and the Smithsonian Institute. Whatever 
        your interests, there will definitely be an organization that fits your 
        niche. Learning doesn&#8217;t just happen in the classroom, and you&#8217;ll 
        learn a great deal about the opportunities that the &#8220;real world&#8221; 
        has to offer.<br>
        <br>
        Besides the incredible experience and knowledge you gain from your job, 
        you will also meet an extraordinary array of people&#8212;the nation&#8217;s 
        current and future leaders. In ten short weeks, I was privileged enough 
        to mingle with everyone from Congresswoman Patsy Mink (the pioneering 
        Asian Pacific American Congresswoman, formerly representing Hawaii) to 
        Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court (albeit by crashing a U Penn 
        event). Likewise, some of the most awe-inspiring people that I met were 
        my fellow interns, a group of the most ambitious, intelligent, and socially 
        conscious college students in the nation. I formed enduring friendships 
        and tight bonds with people who shared my vision and are making a difference 
        in the world. <br>
        <br>
        As a youth in this privileged station in society, you have every opportunity 
        to join them for the experience of a lifetime. I am disappointed by the 
        enduring stereotypes that Asian Pacific Americans are still foreigners 
        and a silent minority. These stereotypes will remain in the American consciousness 
        until Asian Pacific Americans demonstrate their savoir-faire and accomplishments 
        in the political arena. Asian Pacific Americans should work to ameliorate 
        recurring issues specific to their community and outside of it. I encourage 
        everyone to get involved. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said it best: &#8220;Everybody 
        can be great... because anybody can serve. You don&#8217;t have to have 
        a college degree to serve. You don&#8217;t have to make your subject and 
        verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated 
        by love.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        For information on how to find a summer internship that suits your needs 
        and interests, you can start by doing a web search &#8212; it&#8217;s 
        fast, easy, and informative on the types of opportunities offered. Washington, 
        DC is also home to seven universities, including Georgetown University, 
        George Washington University, and Howard University; many of these schools 
        host internship programs in specific academic disciplines and professional 
        fields. In addition, you can look into programs offered by U.C. Berkeley, 
        such as Cal in the Capital (a summer-long program) and UCDC (a semester-long 
        program).</p>
