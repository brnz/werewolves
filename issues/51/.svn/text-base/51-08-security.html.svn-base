<p><b>Patriotism </b></p>
<p>Since September 11, patriotism has been sort of chic. Yet for those who do 
  not want war, different levels of loyalty are required from different communities, 
  and different Americans enjoy varying degrees of freedoms depending on skin 
  color. White folks do not risk having their windows smashed for not putting 
  flags up around their houses while those seen as &#147;foreign,&#148; despite 
  possessing American citizenship, risk having their windows smashed simply because 
  the flags they raise are too small. At this time, those looking even slightly 
  like Arabs and Muslims are being attacked all over the country because they 
  resemble foreign terrorists in the minds of white Protestant America and do 
  not have the luxury to express anti-war sentiments without worrying about their 
  own physical safety. Bush&#146;s claim that &#147;you&#146;re either with us, 
  or you&#146;re with the terrorists&#148; extends to people in this country as 
  &#147;if you are a person of color, you are either a super-patriot or a terrorist.&#148; 
  Whenever conversation revolving around the WTC takes place, every brown person 
  has to declare, &#147;I am very sad about what happened&#148; before expressing 
  any opinion on the matter, though it is assumed without question that white 
  Americans are sad. Ironically, those of us who have never been accepted as &#147;real&#148; 
  Americans are now more than anyone else required to assert our loyalty to this 
  country. White Americans enjoy the freedom of speech, and choose to either rage 
  on about how they want revenge or to protest against war and stand up for people 
  like us who &#147;can&#146;t stand up for ourselves&#148; (despite their having 
  derived doctrines of non-violence from those little brown folks named Gandhi 
  and Dalai Lama. All they might have to face is being called &#147;those liberal 
  Berkeley hippies&#148; by republicans; they are still Americans. Brown and Muslim 
  people, on the other hand, have to visibly display loyalty to this country that 
  has so often discriminated against them before and after 911 in desperate attempts 
  to evade more hostility. And those who don&#146;t declare their love of this 
  country are not hippies, they are dangerous, foreign, un-American. </p>
<p>This was not the case in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City Center bombing. 
  White folks were not considered dangerous. We did not look to white folks for 
  answers. We did not go to white folks asking how their people could be so hurtful 
  or full of hate. No one had to explain that not all white people believe in 
  terrorism, that this particular white dude was sort of extreme and didn&#146;t 
  represent his race or his religion. No one tried to refuse to sell fertilizer 
  to white folks, as airlines are now refusing service to brown folks. There was 
  no anti-white backlash. There was no support for a &#147;retaliatory&#148; war 
  against Europe, or even against Midwestern states of this country where white 
  supremacist groups are flourishing. Random innocent white people were not detained 
  without charges under &#147;secret evidence&#148; laws. CNN did not repeatedly 
  air images of white racists celebrating. </p>
<p>According to the media, white Americans are now afraid because of the threat 
  of terrorist attacks. However, every instance of queer-bashing, every act of 
  domestic violence, and every racist hate crime is a terrorist attack, and the 
  media need to understand that many of the marginalized communities in this country 
  have been afraid of these terrorist threats since long before September 11. 
</p>
<p> <b>&#147;Terrorism&#148; </b></p>
<p>In September of 1982, Ariel Sharon (now the Prime Minister of Israel) gave 
  the go-ahead for Israeli soldiers to allow a Christian militia to enter Palestinian 
  refugee camps in Lebanon. There, while Israeli soldiers watched, and with the 
  full knowledge and assurances of Sharon, the militia murdered close to 2,000 
  innocent, unarmed Palestinians. Sharon has been found by Israeli courts to have 
  been complicit in the massacre. More recently, since last September, Israeli 
  soldiers and settlers have killed close to 700 Palestinians, including almost 
  600 civilians, and injured over 20,000 Palestinians. During this time, Israel 
  has shelled 773 homes, 30 mosques, and 12 churches. Also during the last year, 
  Israeli soldiers and settlers have attacked four hospitals in Bethlehem and 
  one in Jerusalem. They have also attacked a hospital (Alia Hospital) in Hebron 
  3 times, at times wounding patients. Since last September they have made 147 
  attacks on Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulances. So far, Israel is not 
  on the American list of states that harbor terrorists. </p>
<p>In the last 11 years, through bombing campaigns and forced starvation by sanctions, 
  the United States, with the help of the UN, has killed over a million Iraqi 
  civilians. This number includes around 5,000 children every month. When asked 
  about this, Madeline Albright said that it is &#147;worth it.&#148; In addition, 
  during the genocide of over 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda, Albright 
  did everything in her power to delay the deployment of UN troops to protect 
  the victims, to the extent that afterwards UN investigators wondered how she 
  sleeps at night. Albright lives in the United States, and the US does not consider 
  itself a state that harbors terrorists. </p>
<p>In Kashmir, Indian soldiers are killing civilians by the tens of thousands 
  (over 50,000 civilians have been killed in the last 10 years, including 14 more 
  as this article is being written), using gang rape as a weapon to demoralize 
  the Kashmiri resistance, and destroying the land and homes of average Kashmiris, 
  so that civilians live in terror of the Indian military. But when we talk about 
  terrorism in the region, we are generally talking about Kashmiri, not Indian, 
  violence, and since S11 Colin Powell himself has included a war against the 
  Kashmiri people who are struggling for self-determination as part of the &#147;war 
  on terrorism,&#148; but has not said anything about a war on Indian occupation 
  forces in Kashmir. </p>
<p>The US refers to the 1999 American Embassy bombings in East Africa as terrorist 
  attacks. When American planes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, the 
  excuse was that they had the wrong map (who really believes that?). There was 
  no mention of terrorism. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, last year there was an attack on the USS Cole, an American tanker 
  that was refueling at a port in Yemen. Despite the fact that the targets were 
  military personnel instead of civilians, this act is also referred to as an 
  act of terrorism. <br>
  It seems that a terrorist act is not defined by the nature of the act (&#147;barbaric&#148; 
  vs. &#147;civilized&#148;) or by the targets of the violence (military vs. civilian), 
  but by the identity of the perpetrators of the violence and whether they are 
  friends or foes of the United States. </p>
<p><b>Celebrations</b> </p>
<p>When the United States bombs Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, or Kosovo, we do not 
  see news stories about each victim, what church they went to, who their kids 
  were, which quiet suburb of which city they lived in. We do not see how sick 
  people in Sudan were affected by the bombing of the pharmaceutical plant that 
  makes their medicine. We did not see stories about how Kosovar civilians were 
  affected by the destruction of their favorite coffee shops. Perhaps if we did, 
  we would actually care. Instead, Americans celebrate those bombings as &#147;victories,&#148; 
  and ignore the insignificant &#147;collateral damage&#148; (the Pentagon uses 
  this term to refer to thousands of civilians who are &#147;accidentally&#148; 
  killed in raids on civilian centers). But now, do people in Palestine see all 
  the stories we&#146;ve been seeing? Or do they just see that the World Trade 
  Center and the Pentagon, symbols of American military and economic control of 
  the world, have been destroyed? And then should anyone be all that surprised 
  to see 30 or 40 (out of 8 million in the world) Palestinians, who have been 
  watching Apache helicopters that say &#147;Made in the USA&#148; dropping bombs 
  that say &#147;Made in the USA&#148; on their homes, celebrating? </p>
<p>As far as inappropriate celebrations go, did Americans consider how Iraqis 
  may have felt to see Americans parading through the streets celebrating the 
  10th Anniversary of the Gulf War, in which hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians 
  were killed? </p>
<p><b>Sacrificing &#147;our&#148; freedom for the sake of security </b></p>
<p>Some critics have already pointed out the irony of the government&#146;s curtailing 
  civil liberties in order to fight the bad guys who &#147;hate freedom.&#148; 
  But not everyone is talking about the fact that when Bush says we need to sacrifice 
  some of our freedoms for the sake of security, he is talking about brown people&#146;s 
  freedoms and white people&#146;s security. It is not everyone who is having 
  her phone tapped or being questioned and/or detained. </p>
<p><b>Honoring the Victims</b> </p>
<p>Many people have been equating war with &#147;honoring the victims of the September 
  11 tragedy.&#148; The people who died in the September 11 attacks were janitors, 
  foodservice workers, clerical workers, rescue workers, firepeople, paramedics. 
  So in a sense, honoring the victims also means honoring labor. Yet, instead 
  of honoring the victims by respecting labor rights, Bush is planning to send 
  working class people who cannot afford a college education to war. Furthermore, 
  he is taking advantage of the bipartisan atmosphere to push through Fast Track 
  legislation, which gives him the unlimited right to sign international trade 
  agreements that would push down labor standards in this country and around the 
  world. Few of the leaders planning for war are trying to do anything for the 
  thousands who have lost their jobs since September 11, from those who worked 
  in the WTC to those who worked in airline companies to those who have been hit 
  hardest by the recent economic downturn. In addition, some politicians have 
  mentioned a plan to federalize airport security jobs. If they were to implement 
  this plan, the effects could be devastating: since federal jobs require U.S. 
  citizenship, many of the workers who currently work in airport security would 
  be fired. For example, many of the airport security workers at Oakland airport 
  are Pilipino and don&#146;t have U.S. citizenship. The S11 commemorative caps 
  exemplify what this war means for workers and for organized labor. These caps 
  were made by New Era Cap Company, whose employees are currently on strike and 
  against whom the AFL-CIO has endorsed a boycott (see hb4.6). But the company, 
  with the assistance of the government, is capitalizing on the attacks, making 
  new caps with American flags for Major League Baseball and commemorative USA 
  caps to remember the victims. These new caps are all made by scab labor. Those 
  who are using the rhetoric of honoring and remembering the victims are at the 
  same time making every effort to screw the working class </p>
