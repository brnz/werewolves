<p>Theatre Rice, an Asian American student performance group here at Cal, puts 
  on a showcase at the end of each fall and spring semester. Founded by Cal alums 
  Michael Cheng and Duy Nguyen in 1998, Theatre Rice is a forum allowing Asian 
  Americans to display their artistic talents that otherwise are overlooked in 
  a mainstream which lacks in roles, and is full of misrepresentation. The showcase 
  usually comprises of student originated films, short plays, monologues, dances, 
  and the popular sketch comedy skits. The comedy skits provide satirical glimpses 
  into Asian American life and challenge common Asian stereotypes, but all with 
  good natured satire while allowing Asian Americans to demonstrate their comedic 
  talents. In the Spring 2001 semester, Theatre Rice unleashed its very first 
  performance consisting exclusively of comedy skits because of their overwhelming 
  popularity. Now, in Fall 2001, Theatre Rice follows with another show. </p>
<p>There were a total of seven skits performed, four of which dealt with specific 
  Asian humor. For example, in &#147;Dim Sum,&#148; a white female learns how 
  to use chopsticks from an Asian male &#147;chopstick master&#148; in order to 
  prove to a rude Chinese waitress that she can use chopsticks and is not handed 
  a fork (while her Asian American peers were politely handed chopsticks) and 
  subsequently treated as an outsider, the next time she shows up at the Chinese 
  dim sum restaurant. As the &#147;Dim sum&#148; skit shows, Asian Americans can 
  hardly be treated as foreigners in some of the tastiest Asian restaurants, but 
  instead the white female character is viewed as an outsider when she isn&#146;t 
  offered chopsticks, as she gets a taste of what actual racial exclusion feels 
  like. &#147;Super Self ID Sampler&#148; satirizes the epitome of racial stereotypes, 
  and makes us laugh till it hurts. Here, a group of students wear costumes that 
  represent their ethnic identity &#147;roots&#148; for an Ethnic Studies course. 
  A white male in the group is dressed up as an &#147;egg,&#148; two assimilated 
  Asian Americans dress up as a &#147;bananas&#148; and a &#147;coconut,&#148; 
  and another Asian American dresses up as a &#147;yellow M&amp;M.&#148; The white 
  male, or the &#147;egg&#148;, seems to be the most Asian because of his inclination 
  to study and stay focused while periodically quoting from Confucius. In other 
  words, he talks like a fortune cookie. Through this display of satire, when 
  we laugh, we can laugh at the superficiality of racial stereotypes and the silly 
  notion that a person can become something to others merely because he or she 
  reveals some common stereotypical traits in his or her personality. All in all, 
  fun humor takes precedence, of course with a hint of &#147;Asian.&#148;</p>
<p>Theatre Rice is a forum where Asian Americans can live their acting aspirations 
  onstage while winning audiences over and not having to worry about cracking 
  into an American entertainment industry that remains exclusive. All of you readers 
  are welcome to the upcoming Theatre Rice showcase in November. </p>
