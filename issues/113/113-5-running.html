<h2>running to end human slavery</h2></a>

<span class="tagline"><em>Bay Area Freedom Run</em></span>
<p>
by susan moua
</p>
<p>At 6:30 AM on a cold Saturday morning,
I headed for San Francisco to join fourteen
others in the very first Bay Area Freedom Run/
Walk. The event, organized by the Students
& Artists Fighting to End Human Slavery
(SAFEHS), aimed to raise awareness of the
human trafficking and slavery that occurs on
our own familiar Bay Area streets.
</p><p>On November 17th, fifteen Cal students and
activists walked the six miles of Geary Street,
from Embarcadero to 48th, an area along the
Tenderloin district in downtown San Francisco.
Geary Street was chosen as a reminder that
behind its bustling daily traffic, this same
street, like many others across the United
States, at nightfall and during the wee hours
of the morning, becomes witness to human
trafficking and slavery.
</p><p>SAFEHS, founded by Cal graduate student
Annie Fukushima, through multimedia art,
education and community coalitions aims to
create a safe space to define what human
slavery/human trafficking means to them
and how we are all impacted by this “global
phenomenon.” In particular, SAFEHS
supports artists who use their vision to express
perspectives on human slavery. Centering
their activities in the Bay Area, SAFEHS
launched the Bay Area Freedom Run/Walk
this year, raising over a thousand dollars
with just fifteen participants. All the money
raised will be donated to the Polaris Project
(www.polarisproject.org), an international
organization against human slavery, founded
by two Asian American students from Brown
University. Fukushima believes the event was
a success, “To make the Freedom Run/Walk
even possible was a success…it’s about
raising awareness” she said.
</p><p>For many of us who walked instead of ran,
we encountered supporters, passer-bys, and
others who were simply confused.
</p><p>Human trafficking statistics are often
hard to gather since the most majority of it is
conducted underground. The San Francisco
Chronicle recently reported that six hundred to
eight hundred thousand women and girls are
trafficked internationally. San Francisco is one
of the major ports used to sexually traffic these
women.
</p><p>What also stands out is that Asians make up
about 47 percent of all sex trafficking victims,
with the Philippines being the number one
exporter of humans being trafficked and 50
percent of all trafficked being children. Asian
women who fall victim are often trafficked and
exploited by people from their own countries.
They are lured in with false
promises of good pay and jobs in
wealthier nations but upon arrival
find no such treatment. Their
passports are often withheld,
and then they are forced to work
as sexual slaves in a completely
unfamiliar environment under
harsh conditions, with little
chance of leaving. A study by
the United Nations attributes 80
percent of prostitution to human
trafficking activities.
</p><p>In the U.S., the Victims of
Trafficking and Violence Act of
2000 and its reauthorization in
2003 provide some protection
and services for victims of human
slavery, but with those convicted
of such crimes spending only
months in jail, it does little to
hinder the ever growing $8 billion
international industry.
</p><p>No country is immune from
human slavery and human
trafficking. Human slavery has
become a global issue that should
be immediately dealt with. The awareness
raised by organizations such as SAFEHS is
a good start, particularly if they spur action.
</p><p>Young runners, as young as fifteen were
participants of the Freedom Run/Walk. Jamie
Moua, a high school student from Fresno,
came to San Francisco the weekend of the
Freedom Run/Walk to support human rights
for victims of human trafficking and slavery.
“I’m only in high school but I want to be more
involved with issues concerning human rights.
I plan to go back to Fresno to inform my high
school about the walk.” Like the other fifteen
runners, Moua found the experience refreshing
and inspiring, “It was a small movement but it
was powerful.”
