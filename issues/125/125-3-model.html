<h2>Jindal: The Republican’s Model “Model Minority”</h2></a>

by montague hung</p>

<p><b><i>How Jindal's background distorts perception of opportunities for Asian Americans</i></b></p>


<p>Bobby Jindal has become the new rising star of the Republican Party and his selection as the one to give the Republican response to President Obama's address to Congress earlier this year underscores his continuing list of political achievements. In Jindal's speech, he talked about his background as a minority and his parents' experience as immigrants. It seems as if an Asian American has finally made it on the highest stage of national politics.</p>
<p>But Democrats and Republicans have viciously ripped Jindal for his response to President Obama, which has been criticized as “too amateur”. He condemned federal spending throughout his speech, but then asked for billions of federal aide for the reconstruction of Louisiana, which is still struggling to rebuild itself after Hurricane Katrina. It seems that aside from his policy standpoints, there must be other issues that influence the Republican's decision to promote Jindal.</p>
<p>One alternative reason in the Republican's decision must have been Jindal's self-identification as an Asian American. When Jindal spoke about his background, I could not help but notice him trying to mirror his experience with that of the President's. The first part of Jindal's response described how his parents could not initially afford the doctor's fee for his birth. The response goes on to say that through hard work, Americans can do anything. In addition to promoting limited government, the Republicans seem to be trying hard to make their party seem inclusive of minority groups by making a person of color their poster child.</p>
<p>Jindal's rising status is used as a political counterpoint to President Obama's journey and brings up the question, how hard is it for minorities to be successful? Jindal's response downplayed the significance of President Obama's journey, to show that people of color have an equal opportunity to succeed in America. Jindal embodies the model minority myth: that Asian Americans, through hard work, illustrate the attainableness of the American dream by everyone. While President Obama's recognition that the effects of segregation are still being felt is an example of his acknowledgement that there lies a need to remedy society's prejudices against people of color, Jindal seems to be oblivious of institutions that make it harder for minorities to achieve their American dream. This only further entrenches the obstacles that Asian Americans face today.</p>
<p>The way that Jindal portrays his beliefs further masks the discrimination that Asian Americans today still face. A recent national survey of Asian Americans conducted by UC Berkeley's Professor Taeku Lee shows that 35% of Asian Americans have been a victim of some form of discrimination1. But even with such a high figure, many people, even other Asian Americans, are not aware that such problems are so pervasive. In Jindal's address, his refusal to recognize discrimination against people of color in housing, the work environment, and justice system further perpetuates the model minority myth and contributes to the ignorance that cripples Asian Americans. The truth is, Jindal is not the typical Asian American success story. There are many people who work hard, just as he advocates, but because they are people of color, they are hindered by social institutions with intractable racial biases from achieving their goals.</p>
<p>It is imperative that people are aware of the prejudices that minorities still face today. There currently does not exist an even playing field, as Jindal suggests. The success of people of color, such as President Obama's, must be celebrated as a special triumph because they encountered more difficulties than others do. Contrary to Jindal's view, Asian Americans are people of color who still face discrimination. By spreading awareness of the difficulties still facing the Asian American community, society can work towards rectifying those inequalities. Only after, can Jindal's claims be true. Until then, his image and statements that all Americans can achieve their dreams if only they worked hard remains a farce.</p>
