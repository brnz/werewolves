<span class="tagline"><em>ShadowNite provides a new perspective for high school students</em></span>
<p>

<p>At Cal, it is quite common to see small groups of
people going on campus tours and checking out
the Campanile and the buildings. But on November
8, there were about 100 high school students who
came to Berkeley to attend ShadowNite. These
students did not only come for the campus tour, but also for
the various workshops and information about the path towards
higher education. ShadowNite, organized by REACH! (The
Asian/Pacific Islander Recruitment and Retention Center), is a
three day, two night program that brings high school students
from central California and the Bay Area to the UC Berkeley
campus. From November 8 to 10, high school students from
Stockton, Sacramento, Oakland, and Vallejo all participated
in interactive workshops, shared common experiences
with one another, and stayed with college students while
learning about college life.
</p><p>For ShadowNite, there were different ice-breakers,
workshops, and social activities planned for the youth.
Among the workshops, the political awareness workshop
introduced the youth to a different perspective that is not
likely to be taught in school. College students presented
a different side of hip-hop to the younger youth. The
high school students engaged in discussions about the
different types of hip-hop music and artists. They talked
about the common themes in hip-hop music, such
as racism, challenge of authority, poverty, and youth
empowerment. During this workshop, the organizers
showed several music videos, talked about the meaning
of hip-hop, and pointed out how hip-hop can be used as
a form of resistance. In addition, the high school students
were also challenged to understand how different hip hop
songs are selected for the mainstream. Many students
were especially amazed by the spoken word artists that
performed that day, which included UC Berkeley students
Diana Savangsy, Maurice Seaty, and Sannah Rahim.
Their words, voices, and messages helped students
understand how this form of expression can be a way for
people to deal with their problems in their families, schools,
communities, or within their identities.
</p><p>Besides raising political awareness, ShadowNite strives to
offer students academic assistance towards higher education.
The participants that ShadowNite recruited were mainly Asian
American students. Even though it seems that the Asian
American population is doing well in school, certain ethnic
groups within the category are less likely to attain higher
education and receive academic assistance.
</p><p>“We outreach to those youth that have potential to succeed
in life, but are having difficulties to get to that success due to
limited resources around their communities. In our program, we
stress the importance of pursuing any form of higher education
to our students -- no matter if it is a community college, CSU,
UC, private, or a trade school,” said Anna Chiang, one of the
coordinators of ShadowNite.
</p><p>The academic workshop informed students about the
different forms of higher education and ways to pay for tuition.
Students learned about scholarships, grants, loans, and the
FAFSA. Another important aspect of this workshop was the
Individual Academic Planner (IAP), which is a form that helps
students plan their way to college, based on the completion
of the A-G requirements. From this, the high school students
were able to figure out what classes or credits they need to
take in order to graduate from high school.
</p><p>The political awareness and academic workshops certainly
define a big portion of the program, but we must not forget
that ShadowNite is also a chance for different students to get
a feeling of what college is like. Many high school students
may have heard of college, but few of them have actually
taken campus tours or even seen how big a college campus
is. Thus, ShadowNite is a great opportunity for students from
disadvantaged backgrounds to personally experience the
college environment. With the college students volunteering
as big brothers and big sisters, the high school students can
learn about their mentors’ experiences and insights, and
understand that college is not just a dream, but can also be a
reality for them. In fact, everyone learns from each other and
realizes that they have grown a lot out of these three days and
two nights.
</p><p>“I enjoy planning this event because I believe that this event
can change lives, not only the high school students’ (mentees)
lives but the college students’ (mentors) lives as well”, Chiang said,
“I was a past Shadow mentor, and that experience of mentoring
a group of students changed my perspective on everything.
When you see the growth of the mentees in terms of knowledge,
community awareness, and self-confidence from the day they
step in to the day that they leave the program, you will definitely
feel that you had made a positive impact on a student’s life.
This feeling is so rewarding; it makes my endless nights of
no sleep from planning this event worthwhile.”
</p><p>For every ShadowNite, the most inspiring and
memorable part of the event would probably be when
the mentors share their life stories and the experiences
they had in high school and college. Khristopher Patrick,
a participant from Oakland High School, explains the
impact of ShadowNite on him: “The intervention that we
had on the last day was a real eye opener. I thought the
things that I went through were stressful; but I really have
nothing to worry about compared to the lives of the people
who shared their experiences. Their stories made me
want to change the way I live my life and get my priorities
in line.” Through this activity, the high school students
learned about the different struggles that many mentors
had faced on their way to higher education. From this
process of opening up and sharing personal experiences,
the students gained a new perspective and were inspired
to persist when faced with their own hardships.
</p><p>Overall, the ShadowNite event was a success,
bringing in different groups of students and providing an
eye-opening experience for the students and mentors.
Surely, after the event, the students have a better grasp of
“college” and are more socially aware about our communities.
To those who come from socioeconomically disadvantaged
communities, this experience has reassured their dreams and
given them the confidence and resources they lacked before in
terms of higher education. ShadowNite will definitely continue
on, providing more opportunities to students who are in need.
</p><p>For those who are interested in becoming a mentor,
volunteer, houser, or a part of this life-changing event in Spring
2008, please contact the Shadow Coordinators: Anna Chiang,
