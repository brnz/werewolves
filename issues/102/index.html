There is a concept in mass communications theory known as “the sleeper effect,” which arose from a study from Darlene B. Hannah of Wheaton College and Brian Sternthal of Northwestern University. “The sleeper effect” contends that a message’s effectiveness increases the longer the audience receives it, regardless of the audience’s attentiveness. As a result, over time, a person will more likely retain a message but is less likely to remember the message’s original source. This becomes crucial during election time when voters are constantly bombarded by negative images of candidates and issues. For example, a voter may remember that Phil Angelides is bad, but won't remember that Arnold Schwarzenegger said so. This same concept also applies when we hear about controversial topics. Take for example, the affirmative action issue. In Jed Levine's tasteless satirical piece in The Daily Bruin entitled, "A Modest Proposal for an Immodest Proposition," he argues that Asian Americans shouldn't support affirmative action because they will get the short end of the stick. In a few weeks, we won't know who wrote the article, but we will definitely remember what has been said. Is he going to get away with what he wrote? Probably. Man, what a joke.<br><br>
I think about this world in terms of distributive justice. I believe that what goes around will come around. We need to rectify the wrongs of the past and the present in order to instill change in our society. As Asian Americans, if we do not support affirmative action, we are no better off than the US government when it passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. We are no better than the slave owners in Antebellum South. When the plantation owners in Hawaii wanted to break up strikers, they pitted minorities against each other and made them compete for work. As Asian Americans become divided on the issue of affirmative action, a parallel can be drawn to the strikebreakers in Hawaii. As part of the marginalized minority, we need to stick together. When Levine says that Asian Americans are overrepresented in higher education, he definitely isn't talking about the Pacific Islanders or the Southeast Asian Americans, who currently have one of the highest dropout rates out of all ethnic groups. This is why we need to build coalitions and fight for increased minority representation in our schools. The quality of our higher education can only improve with increased diversity, which is why we must continue fighting for increasing underrepresented minority enrollment.<br><br>
We have the ability to change the future. We have the ability to be heard. Don't be a victim of the "sleeper effect." You're smarter than that. Make people eat their words. Get active.<br><br>
fighting the good fight,<br>
