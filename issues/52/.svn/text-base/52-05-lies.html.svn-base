<p>As Americans were awakening to the horror of the incidents on September 11, 
  life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in Palestine were continued in the same 
  way they have for about fifty some years: occupied and oppressed. As America 
  was waiting and grieving, Israeli tanks were taking no breather, rolling through 
  the West Bank towns of Jenin and Arriyeh, killing about 11 civilians in one 
  night on a war drive with no sense of abating. And they have yet to abate; since 
  the assassination of right wing Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavan Ze&#146;evi 
  on October 17, an act claimed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
  (PFLP), the occupation has turned into an all out war on the Palestinian people, 
  with Israeli tanks moving into and shelling six separate towns, a new string 
  of extra-judicial assassinations of Palestinian leaders, and an intensification 
  of demolition of Palestinian homes. Meanwhile, the Israeli state has forced 
  the hand of its proxy &#147;government,&#148; the Palestinian Authority, and 
  brought them to join this war by outlawing the PFLP and preventing any major 
  Palestinian protests. </p>

<p>As the death toll in Palestine from the past few weeks reaches the hundred 
  mark and the oppression is escalated, Israel is telling the United States to 
  simply sit back and sympathize because &#147;now we know what Israel feels like.&#148; 
  Within the first week, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon released statements 
  that he was &#147;concerned&#148; about the United States not recognizing the 
  Palestinian resistance as terrorism and wanted to make sure to get in on the 
  new &#147;war against terrorism&#148; game Bush was playing. Sharon needed not 
  worry, though; the U.S. media was quite quick to equate terrorism with the struggle 
  in Palestine, accusing almost every Palestinian resistance organization of the 
  tragedy in the first hours after September 11. Covers from magazines such as 
  Time show Arab men wearing the Palestinian traditional kuffiyeh with titles 
  like &#147;Why they hate us,&#148; and articles about &#147;Arab rage,&#148; 
  and a million other images creating an angry Arab Palestinian pitted against 
  the United States. </p>
<p>But as Sharon and Bush get up and wage war on &#147;terrorism,&#148; no one 
  knows exactly what we are fighting and how we are fighting; we are simply told 
  to throw up our flags, open our pocketbooks, and shut our mouths in support. 
  No one, in the meanwhile, has even defined terrorism; no one gets to know what 
  makes any country on the 80 Bush named to be &#147;harboring terrorists&#148; 
  even qualify; no one even asks why state terrorism is conveniently left out 
  of the game or why, for instance, the Israeli Defense&#146;s shelling of civilian 
  towns, shooting of Palestinian demonstrators, bulldozing Palestinian homes, 
  or anything on the endless list of &#147;collective punishments&#148; is not 
  a terrorist act. Unless these are addressed, terrorism becomes nothing more 
  than a blank check for destroying anything not in line with United States interests, 
  which tends to mean any resistance groups. This becomes more and more obvious 
  as new countries jump on the terrorism bandwagon and start their own crackdowns: 
  Russia has resumed its brutal crackdown on secessionist Chechen rebels, with 
  the United States offering Russia the possibility of using small scale nuclear 
  weapons against them; China has been given the green light to oppress Muslim 
  factions to its North, and India has been given full reign to reaffirm control 
  of Kashmir. The shadows of another Cold War become more and more obvious as 
  the world gets drawn up along these lines of &#147;good and evil,&#148; with 
  every country from the Philippines to Bolivia facing major crackdowns on popular 
  movements. The United States speaks of a &#147;long and drawn out war,&#148; 
  and there is little chance terrorism will not simply be another catch-all for 
  a half century of intervention and neo-colonialism against any country outside 
  of U.S. and &#147;coalition&#148; interests.</p>
<p>In the shadow of this war, which is already taking full force in Afghanistan, 
  the issue of Palestine becomes more and more important and necessary to bring 
  to the forefront. Palestinians are already facing the brunt of fifty years of 
  occupation and a land that over 6 million refugees are forbidden to return to, 
  and the past year of intifada, the climax of their resistance, threatens to 
  be shut down by a brutal war. Palestine is not just an issue for the endless 
  catalogue of human rights violations Israel has committed against it and it 
  is not just an issue for the fact that the Palestinian people cannot live a 
  normal life and are under economic, political and social subjugation. Palestine 
  is an issue of race, where people of color were once again thrown off their 
  land because they were not European; Palestine is an issue of neo-colonialism, 
  where over 73% of the Palestinian population was expelled out of the 1948 borders 
  of Israel in one fell swoop; Palestine is an issue of whether people have the 
  right to determine the fortune of their own land and not relegate it to Western 
  interests. The list is endless, but this merely reveals the fact that Palestine 
  is not merely some &#147;conflict&#148; where Palestinians abstractly do not 
  like Israel; if anything, Palestinians know what terrorism is because they feel 
  it every day. It is a legitimate struggle against an occupying force, one British 
  colonizers fought against British colonizers to create a place called the United 
  States, a struggle that people around the world had to fight and were given 
  the chance to fight to oust European colonialism for over 200 years, from Haiti 
  to the Phillipines to Algeria. Supporting Palestine is standing in line with 
  these ideals; it is not siding with Osama Bin Laden, as some may pose. Bin Laden&#146;s 
  speech may have appropriated Palestine as some goal of his, but the reality 
  is that the struggle is far removed and Bin laden has simply appropriated rhetoric 
  to gain support, much like any politician would. </p>
<p>The issue now is not to get the United States involved in some &#147;peace 
  deal;&#148; the issue is to support Palestinians in a struggle for self determination, 
  something snatched from their hands as many other countries were getting it 
  in the wake of World War II and decolonization. The United States will always 
  have to come to its own interests, as it has during every &#147;peace&#148; 
  brokerage, a brokerage resulting in what we have now: Palestinians living in 
  economic and political oppression in two small plots of land representing a 
  miniscule amount of their original homeland. The struggle for justice and freedom 
  for Palestine cannot occur in the framework of conflict resolution and United 
  States power jockeying but must happen when Palestinians are allowed to stand 
  up and create a homeland of their own. Really &#147;dealing with terrorism&#148; 
  can only occur when terrorism is stamped out of state policy, and people are 
  not left in conditions of desperation, where their dying seems to be the only 
  option out of their life of total oppression and occupation.<br>
