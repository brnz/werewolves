<p>A decal is a course that you can take that is run by students from UC Berkeley. Check us out on <a href="http://decal.org/671">their website</a>. If you sign up for our decal, you'll get 1 Asian American Studies field unit, which adds up to 45 hours of field work, or basically, 45 hours of some really fun <b>hardboiled</b> goodness. You don't need to be in the decal to be on staff, but why not get units for the work your doing?</p>

<div id="info"><h2>basic info</h2></div>
<p><b>Course Title:</b> Asian American Studies 97/197<br>
<b>Location and Time:</b> 204 Wheeler, Wednesdays at 6pm - 7:30pm<br>
<b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:ali_tse@berkeley.edu">Alice Tse</a> and <a href="mailto:anniekim07@gmail.com">Annie Kim Noguchi</a></p>
<p><b>Objective:</b> To provide students with an introduction to Asian American print journalism through the actual hands-on experience of participating in the production and distribution of Berkeley's largest Asian American newsmagazine, <b>hardboiled</b>. It is a work-intensive job that requires weekly effort and dedication on the part of the staff and core aside from their usual coursework. Each issue of <b>hardboiled</b> (three per semester, 12-16 pages each) usually requires a month to complete. We will cover the basics of what goes into the publications and discuss issues in the Asian American community.</p>
<p><b>Deadline to add this class is the end of the 3rd week of instruction! So email Kat or Kory for Course Information and the CCN!</b></p>
