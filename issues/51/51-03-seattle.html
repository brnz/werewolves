<p>To most people, a group of Asian American high schoolers crossing a Downtown 
  street doesn&#146;t seem like much of a problem. To Seattle Police, apparently, 
  it&#146;s criminal. </p>
<p>On July 9th, at around 1:30 PM, a group of Asian American teenagers were stopped 
  by a police officer on the south side of Downtown Seattle, near Seattle&#146;s 
  International District (Chinatown). These fourteen high school students were 
  participating in an Asian youth leadership conference, and, among other things, 
  were in on lectures about racial discrimination against Asian Americans. They 
  received an unsolicited demonstration. </p>

  Thao Le asked the officer if he would do the same to a group of white kids crossing the 
  street. She later became the only person to actually receive a jaywalking ticket.

<p>While being chaperoned by instructors, the students were on their way to another 
  lecture when the officer spotted them crossing the street. According to the 
  officer, the students were crossing illegally. The students claim to not have 
  seen a crosswalk signal. </p>
<p>Officer Jess Pitts first confronted the group in his patrol car using the car&#146;s 
  loudspeaker and asked, &#147;Do you speak English?&#148; According to members 
  of that group, they did not stop to answer because they were too shocked that 
  they would be addressed in this way, and that other people were crossing the 
  street as well. Officer Pitts continued by asking them if they understood English 
  and if they knew how to cross the street. Finally, he had them detained against 
  the building on the other side of the street. </p>
<p>Once against the wall, Pitts repeatedly berated them. Pitts continued to detain 
  them, continually asking if they knew English, if they were foreigners, or if 
  they knew how to cross a street.&nbsp; Student An Nguyen, 17, responded to Pitts 
  saying, &#147;Yeah, we know English,&#148; and according to Nguyen, Pitts told 
  him he didn&#146;t like his attitude. </p>
<p>Eventually, two other officers arrived. One of them accosted Thao Le, a 17-year 
  old student. She asked the officer if he would do the same to a group of white 
  kids crossing the street. The officer became infuriated at her for &#147;playing 
  the race card.&#148; She later became the only person to actually receive a 
  jaywalking ticket. </p>
<p>The students could not come to any other conclusion for their mistreatment 
  other than because of their race. </p>
<p>Race had nothing to do with it, according to Police spokesman Pam McCammon, 
  nor was it the reason why the officer asked them if they could speak English. 
  &#147;Given the time and date- the All-Star Game was the next day- that was 
  a reasonable question,&#148; she noted. The city anticipated an influx of Japanese 
  coming to attend Major League Baseball&#146;s All-Star Game, which featured 
  Suzuki, a Japanese national hero. To Officer Pitts, there was a possibility 
  that the group of students were tourists who couldn&#146;t understand a lick 
  of English. She however failed to explain why the city would want to treat tourists 
  so disrespectfully or why detention and the offensive remarks were necessary, 
  especially after it was established they were not foreigners. </p>
<p>For now, the students have put that community leadership training to good use, 
  and with the help of other community leaders, they have taken steps to remedy 
  the situation. They have gone to the media and held a press conference to publicize 
  the case. Le&#146;s $38 jaywalking ticket was contested and thrown out in court 
  in August. A forum was held at a community center a few weeks later, and Mayor 
  Paul Schell and Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske stood in front of a packed auditorium 
  trying to defuse the incident. The students have filed a formal complaint with 
  the police, and have demanded a full independent investigation, sensitivity 
  training for officers, and a formal apology. </p>
<p>So far, all they have now are informal apologies from Schell and Kerlikowske. 
  Both maintain it was just a misunderstanding. To help the students understand 
  the city&#146;s point of view, Schell had offered the students a tour of his 
  office and Kerlikowske offered them the opportunity to shadow officers on duty. 
</p>
<p>An Nguyen was not impressed. &#147;I laughed to that. Even if they paid me, 
  I would not do that. (Riding in a police car and visiting the mayor&#146;s office) 
  is not going to help anything.&#148; </p>
