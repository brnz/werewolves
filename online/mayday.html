<h2>Mayday may day???</h2>
by jason coe<br>
<span class="isdate">may 2007</span>
<p>
Begrudgingly, I awoke this morning
to attend a “mandatory” 9 AM class because the instructor had written me an
email specifically asking me to attend. My attendance record is substandard at
best. While walking along the empty streets of Telegraph Avenue, I was well
aware that today was <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day">International
Workers’ Day</a> and the anniversary of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Boycott">Great American
Boycott of 2006</a>, but my main objective was to get my name on the class
sign-in sheet and then promptly zone out. From the estimates I’d read in most
major newspapers, I was doubtful that this year’s protests would bring out <a
href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1911807">millions</a>, <a
href="http://www.nbc4.tv/news/8289535/detail.html">shut down major freeways</a>
and make the voices of 12 million undocumented immigrants and their allies
heard around the world like the protests of 2006.</p>
<p>However, despite my low
expectations I was surprised by the paltry attendance of this major event by
the students at the supposed <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley#1960s_and_the_Free_Speech_Movement">activist
capital of the world</a>, UC Berkeley. Last year I remember the campus was
nearly shut down as hundreds of students crowded Sproul Plaza, chanting “<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_se_puede">Si, se puede</a>!” and holding
signs that declared: “The Pilgrims Didn’t Have Green Cards!” and “No Human is
Illegal!,” all in solidarity with the protests rocking the nation from March to
May in 2006 – the largest protests in American history. Instead, this year’s
contingent was a jumbled group of 30 or so impassioned students imploring
walkers-by to join the boycott. People ignored them, figuring that it was just
another ineffectual “Berkeley thing.” Embarrassed and slightly ashamed, I
grabbed a flyer and sauntered off to class.</p>
<p>As I shuffled through the door, the
graduate student instructor smiled and said with more than a hint of sarcasm,
“I’m glad you made it.”</p>
<p>Racked with guilt coming from all
sides, I looked at him and said, “Uhm, you know, there’s a boycott of classes
today…”</p>
<p>He looked at me incredulously and
said, “Dude, are you serious? Don’t walk out. I used to do that shit all of the
time and there’s nothing more useless you could do to help immigrants than
walking out of class. Trust me.”</p>
<p>Dumbfounded and intimidated, I took my normal seat in the
back. I thought of all the responses I could have thrown back at this
disillusioned former activist. But I couldn’t escape the mental image of the
trash cans filled with crumpled flyers, the articles about the politically
apathetic Asian American population at Cal, and protestors giving zealous
speeches into loudspeakers that only motivated passersby to turn up the volume
on their iPods.</p>
<p>For the record, I am far from being
a strong political activist. Nearly a decade ago, when I first began my
undergraduate studies, I joined a protest to end <a
href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0328,pyne,45400,1.html">discrimination
against Arab Americans after 9/11</a>. After waving signs and shouting at the
top of my lungs, I felt great. I felt mobilized, active, and more than
anything, proud. But as the weeks passed and the political uproar dwindled, it
dawned on me that our efforts had done little to curtail the continuing violent
attacks against Arab Americans and the slow appropriation of American civil
rights.</p>
<p>
After that sad epiphany six years ago and reading more than my fair share of <a
href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/unbearablelightness/quotes.html">Milan
Kundera</a> (quote# 2), I swore to myself that I would never again march with a
massive protest, shout slogans, nor pump my fist in the air (unless it was at a
sporting event). I decided that journalism would be the avenue through which I
expressed my political inclinations, a decision that would prohibit me from
feeling good about myself for simply standing in a crowd with others.</p>
<p>
Now that I’m a “super-duper senior” (AKA “super slacker”), I’ve steadfastly
abided by this mantra throughout my undergrad career. However, at that moment
the hypocrisy was agonizing, especially after I had written multiple articles
about the importance of immigrant rights, l<a
href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Ehboiled/9-6.pdf">ambasting my fellow Asian
American students for not understanding the importance of the last year’s
protests</a> (page 3). Even <em>hyphen</em> <a
href="http://www.hyphenmagazine.com/blog/archives/2006/04/immigrant_right_1.html">represented
last year at these major events</a>. But this year, when the immigration
movement needs more support than ever with the continuing raids by the
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies that are separating families,
where were all of last year’s galvanized and fervent students? My face burned
red.</p>
<p>Five minutes before the march was set
to begin, I gritted my teeth and walked out of class. The instructor smirked at
me and said, “Have fun,” as if that were my goal. “Believe me,” I thought, “fun
would have been to ditch class completely and sleep in like I normally do when
there are picket lines on campus.”</p>
<p>
About forty strong, we left campus and walked against traffic along Telegraph
Ave towards the Oakland City Center. I looked at all the students hustling past
us to class, as I had only an hour ago, and felt disheartened. Among us, I counted
very few actual students, and after a few blocks, and quite a few angry honks
from <a
href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/05/01/MNGQUPIKI81.DTL">already
irritated morning commuters</a>, most of the twenty-somethings with backpacks
on began to peel off.</p>
<p>What began as a solidified march of
the penguins-style protest turned into a rag-tag group of individuals trying
their best to retain courage in the face of road rage. Despite my impulse to be
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpellation#Interpellation.2C_a_concept_coined_by_Althusser">interpellated</a>,
I tried my best ignore the double yellow lines and traffic lights against the
behest of our small police escort. At Alcatraz Avenue, the Berkeley Police
Department left us to the traffic. Soon after, the batteries in the protest
leader’s microphone gave out, children began to whine asking to be carried by
piggy-back, and my feet began to hurt when I saw the hazy outline of the
Oakland Federal Building in the distant horizon.</p>
<p>
But as we continued marching into the less affluent areas, we garnered more and
more support. While we still received the occasional middle finger, drivers
began to honk in encouragement, giving us a wave and a thumbs-up. People
cheered as we walked past, and every few blocks or so a new contingent of
American-flag waving protestors would join the walk. Every additional member
was greeted with a huge cheer. As we passed 40th Street, our entourage had
grown into the hundreds. High school and middle school students, who had joined
us by jumping over fences chained by campus administrators in anticipation of
the walkout, cajoled us with their antics and high-spirits. Soon a large
contingent of Oakland police officers walked alongside us and blocked off
intersections. We were too large to ignore. Suddenly, a six mile walk on a
spring day didn’t seem too bad.</p>
<p>One of the marchers I was lucky
enough to meet was Ramon, a recently laid-off construction worker and father of
five. He had just turned in a job application in Berkeley when he saw us
impeding traffic and spontaneously joined. Upon meeting me, he noted that I was
the only Asian in our brigade. After having my morning caffeine, I was fully
prepared for the conversation this time, and I informed him that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Origin">out
of the projected 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, over a million
originate from Asia</a>. We just happened to be walking through Oakland Koreatown,
and I pointed at the stores and restaurants and estimated that a few of the
onlookers were in all likelihood immigrants that had overstayed their visas and
were now working for poverty wages in this ethnic enclave. I then went on to
tell him about how racist and unfair immigration laws had been leveled against
Asian Americans since the mid 19th century, culminating with the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act">Chinese Exclusion Act
of 1882</a>. Using cheap labor to bolster the economy is an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery#Slavery_in_the_Americas">American
tradition</a>. </p>
<p>
Ramon then asked me, “Then how come more of Asians aren’t marching with us?”</p>
<p>A variety of responses flashed
through my head, but none seemed adequate. I tried to explain that there hadn’t
been much effort to reach out to this marginalized, but massive populace, and
that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_minority_myth">myths
perpetuated about Asians being the model minority</a> had made it significantly
harder for them to mobilize politically. I even forwarded a hypothesis that the
media’s portrayal of the immigrant rights movement as being just a “Mexican
issue” had convinced them that it wasn’t their struggle.</p>
<p>
In the end, I just told him: “Well, I’m here.” And he smiled.</p>
<p>
Just as our conversation ended, we rounded the corner of 14th and Broadway and
met with a huge roar. We looked ahead to see thousands of protestors that had
marched to the city center from the Fruitvale BART station. Cheers erupted from
our ranks, as we scuttled to join the group moving towards the rallying point.
</p>
<p>
As I sifted through the enormous crowd in a fruitless search for my sister who
had marched with the coalition from Laney College, I was happy to see people of
all ethnicities, Asian included, chanting: “Si, se puede!”, “Pueblo escucha!
Estamos en la lucha!” (“People listen! We’re in the fight together!”), and “El
pueblo unido, jamas sera vencido!” (“The people united will never be defeated!”).
</p>
<p>
I felt like a visa-less Mayflower pilgrim that had just sighted land after
nearly a year at sea. This was the promise of America: opportunity for
everyone, not just those that have the financial means to obtain a green card.
After all, except for those of American Indian descent, we’re all the children
of immigrants. This is everyone’s fight, even mine.</p>
