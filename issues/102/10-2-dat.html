    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext">It cannot be easy to be a comedian. First thing you need to get over is the stage fright, the gut-jerking butterflies you get whenever you step in front of a group of people. Even if you get past that, there is the difficulty of developing a unique, trademark style, one that no other comic can emulate. And, to top it all off, you cannot be a comic unless you have the jokes to make the audience keel over in laughter. Yet Dat Phan has it all: the confidence, the recognizable stage presence, and the funnies that won him NBC’s first season of The Last Comic Standing in 2003.<p><br>
Since winning the competition on national TV, Phan has continued to excel. As one of the few minority comics on The Last Comic Standing and one of a handful of recognizable Asian American comedians in the business, Phan has jumped the race hurdle and established himself firmly as a reputable Asian American comedian. Though sandwiched between two white comedians at Cobb’s Comedy Club in San Francisco in mid-October, Phan still shone like a freshly manicured nail with a topcoat.<p><br>
Phan was born in Saigon, Vietnam where he lived until he, his parents and nine siblings immigrated to San Diego. After the September 11th attacks, Phan realized that "life is short" and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a stand-up comedian. His efforts paid off when he gained critical acclaim in 2003's phenomenal run.
While Phan has had success, his reputation as a comedian is limited because of his material. For Phan, his Asian roots become the basis of his routine. Every single one of Dat Phan’s jokes focuses on being Asian, whether it is about dating Asian girls, eating Asian food, or listening to his mother’s broken English. For example, one of his jokes involves him wanting to be a comedian because he was the, "only Asian in high school that failed math."<p><br>
Much like martial arts star Jackie Chan or dragon lady Anna May Wong, Phan has fallen into the same niche of typecasting. With an entire line-up of Asian jokes, Phan appears only to identify with that area of comedy. At Cobb’s Comedy Club, Phan’s performance was strikingly ethnic in comparison to headliner Jake Johannsen and opener Chris Cobbler, neither of whom mentioned race. Instead, Johannsen and Cobbler’s acts had a range of material from crass sex to contemporary politics. Although Phan tried out new jokes on the San Francisco audience, he only repeated Asian themes. Obviously, there is a limit to how much one can hear about Phan’s mother.<p><br>
Though some of his jokes are hilarious because they are surprisingly true, only an Asian audience could fully appreciate Phan’s humor. However, Phan’s audience is not just composed of Asians; his goal is to make his non-Asian audiences laugh as well. Phan succeeds most of the time. But, if these people don’t have an Asian background to identify with, then what are they laughing at? The answer is the prevalent stereotypes of Asians and Asian Americans. Those outside the experiences of Asian mothers and ridiculously spicy foods can only identify with those stereotypes. So while Phan wants to shatter the ideas of "Asians are good at math," "all Asians are kung fu masters" and "because I’m Asian, I’m like Jackie Chan," he only manages to reinforce those ideas for the non-Asian subset of his audience. Moreover, the "Asian-ness" of his jokes have an air of exclusivity, especially his jokes that involve him speaking Vietnamese. Though the audience can imply what he is saying by his body movements, only those who speak the language can really appreciate Phan’s humor.<p><br>
Comedians who are Asian American and whose standup consists of more than just Asian jokes have also garnered acclaim and a considerable fan base. Two examples are the Kims of Comedy and Margaret Cho. The Kims of Comedy—a spin on the popular group "Kings of Comedy"—are a Korean quartet made up of relative unknowns Steve Byrne, Kevin Shea, "Dr. Ken" Jeong, and MadTV player Bobby Lee. The diversity of their backgrounds—Byrne is half Korean and half Irish, Shea was adopted by a white family—helps them breakout of the niche of all-Asian jokesters. The goal of the Kims of Comedy is to show that "Asian comedy is about more than Dat Phan," said Shea in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, citing that, even though they are all Korean, there is no "Korean comedy style." While their heritage does enter into their acts, it is certainly not the basis. For example, Byrne has a more of a crass sense of humor and a plausible imitation of macaroni and cheese, while Dr. Ken wrote a folk song called "History of Rap" and has performed on BET and "Cedric the Entertainer Presents."<p><br>
San Francisco-born Margaret Cho started doing standup at the age of sixteen. When she moved to Los Angeles in her early twenties, she became an overnight success. In 1994, she starred in the ABC television sitcom All-American Girl. Concerns arose, however, over whether or not the show was too ethnic, eventually leading to the show’s cancellation. Showing her deftness and resiliency as a well-rounded comedian, Cho bounced back with her Broadway show I’m the One that I Want and then went on her wildly well-received Notorious C.H.O. tour. Since then, she has stirred controversy by stating anti-Bush comments and fighting for LGBT rights.<p><br>
While the Kims of Comedy and Cho all make references to their parents and the fact that they are Asian American, it is not their entire act. These comedians can frequent late night shows and lead one-(wo)man tours while appealing to a much wider audience than Phan does. These comedians do what most comedians strive to do: find humor in everyday circumstances.<p><br>
Phan is a great Asian comedian. However, as long as he remains attached to his all-Asian routine, there is little chance that he can establish himself as a universally great comedian. Unless he drops his entirely Asian act, Phan is limited to being a novelty, soon to fade off when there are no more jokes about nail salon workers, the aging process of Asians, or his crazy Asian mother. Whether Phan can break out of the Asian bubble or not will prove his greatness as an comedian. But until then, we will just have to enjoy shrieky antics of Dat Phan’s mother.
