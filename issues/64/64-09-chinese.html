    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> Although the FBI and 
        CIA claim to improve Chinese and US relations by recruiting Chinese Americans, 
        their sudden spark of interest in Chinese activities and industry belies 
        a hidden motive to spy on Chinese military intelligence and technology. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Both government institutions are hawking a new publicity campaign to recruit 
        Chinese Americans in order to participate in their programs. A New York 
        Times article stated that the FBI is specifically targeting Chinese students 
        who are in the nuclear physics and aerospace related engineering programs 
        at university campuses around the country. They claim to want to further 
        the &#8220;evolving economic relationship&#8221; between China and the 
        United States as well as &#8220;revitalize their counterintelligence unit.&#8221; 
        The FBI&#8217;s concern with whether or not technology transfers between 
        the US and China are legitimate spurred on the action of recruiting Chinese 
        students, who will be able to use their ethnic status and/or language 
        capabilities to easily penetrate clandestine activities or operations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The CIA is also participating in a similar effort, where the organization 
        is promoting an advertising campaign in order to recruit Chinese American 
        spies and analysts. According to the Washington Times, a great increase 
        in funding has been established in order to boost intelligence on China, 
        and CIA officials are on the hunt to find ethnic Chinese who can &#8220;blend 
        in.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        This method of using Chinese Americans to spy on other Chinese will tear 
        apart solidarity among a strong ethnic group. The FBI and CIA continue 
        to regard China with suspicion, but what is worse is that they are recruiting 
        Chinese Americans to infiltrate people of their own ethnicity. In fact, 
        the CIA incorporated the arrival of the Chinese New Year to promote their 
        project. Their ad reminds Chinese American citizens that &#8220;the Year 
        of the Ram is centered on a strong and clear motivation for peace, harmony, 
        and tranquility during challenging times&#8221; and claims that they are 
        &#8220;equally intent on [their] mission to safeguard America and its 
        people.&#8221; The final touch: &#8220;You, too, can play a key role in 
        this important responsibility.&#8221; In their effort to enlist Chinese 
        American spies against the Chinese government, the organization twists 
        the Chinese celebration into an advertising technique for patriotism rather 
        than cultural awareness. Worst of all, this sudden interest is marred 
        by an underlying suspicion of the Chinese that still permeates the FBI 
        and CIA. &#8220;There is a massive Chinese presence in this country,&#8221; 
        states Brookings Institution scholar Nicholas Lardy in the New York Times. 
        &#8220;To separate those who are here legitimately from those with a government 
        mandate to get a hold of proprietary technology is very difficult.<br>
        <br>
        Patriotism and then suspicion? What exactly are the CIA and the FBI&#8217;s 
        motives? According to Mark Mansfield in the Washington Times, &#8220;It&#8217;s 
        an opportunity to reach some Chinese Americans who otherwise might not 
        consider a career in CIA.&#8221; But underneath the fa&ccedil;ade of improving 
        its counterintelligence unit, perhaps the CIA and the FBI are, in actuality, 
        keeping tabs on Chinese technology and military advancements. Whatever 
        the motive, this recruitment could cause unnecessary dissent among the 
        Chinese ethnicity, as well as with those of other descents if the FBI 
        and CIA continue to use this &#8216;divide and conquer&#8217; tactic.
