Fear and Nativism in the New Ellis Islands<br>
Anti-immigrant sentiment hits small town America.<br><br>

by adrienna wong <br><br>

Mayor Lou Barletta wants to make his city “the toughest place on illegal immigrants in America.” <br><br>

At a city council meeting last year, Barletta sternly warned illegal immigrants, “I would recommend they leave.” With his brazenly xenophobic, anti-immigrant rhetoric, one might assume that Barletta is a hardened local politician entrenched in a city close to the US-Mexico border, an area, according to mainstream media, that lies under siege from swarms of ravenous Mexicans scaling barbed wired fences. But Mayor Barletta isn’t from California, or New Mexico, or even Texas – he’s from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, a former coal town about 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia. <br><br>

Mayor Barletta has been a figurehead for the recent slew of local anti-immigrant ordinances being passed in cities and counties across the country that are experiencing significant in-migration for the first time. These new patterns are the result of South Asian and Mexican immigration, as well as resettlement of Southeast Asian refugee populations. The recruitment of Asian guest workers for reconstruction of areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina has also brought in new immigrants to the Southeast; the New York Times recently reported on the trafficking of Thai and Indonesian workers to New Orleans, where they were cheated and abused by their employers. In recent years, immigrants have started to settle in areas outside of traditional magnet regions like the West Coast, moving to new areas in the South, New England, and the Midwest. Georgia and North Carolina are two states where the immigrant population has increased at an especially rapid pace in the last decade.<br><br>

Many of these communities have responded with xenophobia and hostility to their new neighbors. In 2006, over a hundred new local ordinances passed nationwide sent the message that immigrants are unwelcome. Local councils in areas like Beaufort County, South Carolina and Valley Park, Missouri have passed legislation that punishes landlords for renting housing to undocumented immigrants and requires employers to check the immigration status of their employees. <br><br>
Other towns, like Pahrump, Nevada, have chosen to assert a nationalist agenda by passing ordinances that ban the flying of non-United States flags and declaring English the official language of the city. Another trend has been the increased use of state and local officials to enforce federal immigration laws, which immigrant advocates have argued may lead to racial profiling of people who do not look or sound “American.”<br><br>

Karen Narasaki, president of the Asian American Justice Center, has said that such measures “lead to the erosion of hard-won trust between the police and the diverse communities that they serve, thereby making all Americans less safe.” Immigrants may avoid seeking help for health problems or domestic violence issues because they are scared that hospital workers and local officials will act as immigration agents and turn them in. <br><br>

Undocumented immigrants include a wide spectrum of people, from those who once had valid visas which have since expired, to those who seek asylum. Most all of them have faced the problems of the United States’ flawed immigration system, problems that extend to all levels, from recent local measures to federal policy. In March of this year, Bay Area protesters spoke out against the immigration raids that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been carrying out across the nation. According to an ACLU press release, these raids have included “inappropriate tactics related to children, including conducting round-ups near schools and leaving minor children unattended upon their parent’s arrest,” as well as “ethnic profiling, violations of due process, and abusive treatment.”<br><br>

Although the issue of undocumented immigration is primarily connected to the Latino community in the mainstream discourse, recent estimates note that there are 1.5 million undocumented Asian immigrants in the United States. Approximately one in five Korean Americans do not have legal status, the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium estimates. Another estimated 300,000 undocumented Chinese Americans and 400,000 undocumented immigrants from India currently reside in the United States.<br><br>

These numbers make it clear that the issues of xenophobia and immigration reform are of crucial relevance to the Asian American community. It is especially important for us to take notice of problems facing Asian American communities in new areas where historical support networks have not been set up as they have been in places like the Bay Area. As the recently published “AAPI Principles of Immigration Reform,” signed by over 30 Asian American organizations, emphasizes, we must “stand in solidarity with all immigrant communities... in demanding fair and humane immigration reform... and oppose efforts to divide communities against each other” in order to affirm the human rights of all people and combat narrow definitions of what being “American” means.
