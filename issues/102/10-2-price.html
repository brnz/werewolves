    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext">A controversial article published in the University of California, Los Angeles’s (UCLA) Daily Bruin has renewed debate about Asian American admissions, an issue that many campuses have struggled with for the past several decades. In “A Modest Proposal for an Immodest Proposition,” Jed Levine addresses concerns about diversity on the UCLA campus by offering a convenient solution: increase the enrollment of underrepresented minorities by restricting the number of Asian Americans.<br><br>
Levine’s article is modeled after Jonathan Swift’s “A Modest Proposal,” a well known pamphlet that is often regarded as one of the best examples of sustained irony in English literature. In his work, Swift sarcastically suggests that poor families in Ireland sell their children to be butchered for meat, an intentionally extreme proposal meant to highlight the level of indifference displayed by the landlords and political economists of his time. Levine attempts to imitate this approach by proposing what he considers to be a comparably absurd recommendation.<br><br>
Despite its satirical nature, the article has received a considerable deal of criticism. While some individuals may have been offended by the insensitive remarks aimed at Asian American students, their primary cause for concern is the fact that the premise of Levine’s argument is widely accepted by many people who are dangerously misinformed about the issue. University measures designed to deal with this “over-representation” have relied on this limited understanding of the situation to engage in systematic discrimination against applicants of Asian descent.<br><br>
The flawed reasoning behind this mentality is addressed in a compelling response produced through a multiethnic collaboration on the UCLA campus between leaders of MEChA, the Afrikan Student Union, the Asian Pacific Coalition, and the Pacific Islands Student Association. They point out that the lack of representation for certain minorities is not something that should be attributed to high enrollment rates for Asian American students. While drastically reducing the Asian student population may seem like a simple remedy, it will actually do little to address the true issues of diversity. As the coalition addresses inadequacies in the University’s admissions process, they emphasize the history of solidarity among all students of color.<br><br>
Unfortunately, many campuses are already home to strong anti-Asian sentiments, and while Levine may not share in these feelings himself, his article is an unwelcome reminder that these persistent and misguided notions still endure. Ignorance about key issues, such as the large populations of underprivileged groups within the Asian American community, contribute to this misconception that Asians are a “model minority” with few barriers and widespread success.<br><br>
It is not too surprising that this myth is so popular when administrators, faculty, and students are becoming increasingly aware of the growing presence of Asian Americans at most of the University of California (UC) campuses. This year’s freshman class is especially noteworthy because Asian American applicants filled more spots than any other ethnic group. For the first time in the history of the UC system, a minority population reportedly makes up the largest number of admitted students.<br><br>
In reality, it is quite possible that these figures are misleading. The difference between the number of Asian and White admitted applicants is only about 200 students, a rather insignificant amount when one considers that over 2,700 students declined to state their race or ethnicity. This wide range of unknown applicants may have easily upset the recorded totals. Nevertheless, Asian American students have consistently comprised about 34 percent of each incoming class, despite only representing 14 percent of graduating seniors from California public high schools.<br><br>
While some Asian American applicants may find these numbers encouraging, others view them with a sense of anxiety. With so many Asian Americans already attending some of the nation’s most prestigious universities, many other applicants are concerned that their race will decrease their chances of admission. These students fear that invisible quotas and institutionalized biases will prevent them from being accepted by their schools of choice. They are beginning to realize that in applying to these schools, and especially the UC’s, they are essentially being punished for the success of their predecessors.<br><br>
This backlash against Asian Americans in higher education can manifest itself in many forms, one prominent example being the perpetuation of the “Asian nerd” stereotype. At the annual meeting of the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), an entire panel was dedicated to addressing this issue of universities becoming “too Asian.” During the discussion, it became abundantly clear that there is an undeniable bias against Asian applicants. One panelist stated that she regularly hears admissions officers complain about “yet another Asian student who wants to major in math and science and who plays the violin.” While this may seem like a relatively positive portrayal, it also serves to reinforce the widespread belief amongst admissions directors that Asian American students are not as well rounded as other applicants. Because of this persistent stereotype, many college applicants will be automatically classified as “another boring Asian.”<br><br>
In order to confront these unfortunate biases in the admissions process, many Asian Americans are forced to acknowledge this stereotype and directly demonstrate their “non-Asian” qualities. In one recommendation letter cited as an example, a high school counselor actually wrote, “Rachel, for an Asian, has a lot of friends.” While the phrase may have been written with the best of intentions, it is a blatantly racist statement that suggests that it is unnatural for Asians to have a social life. Many students are encouraged to be “less Asian” by engaging in more extracurricular activities and taking on leadership roles that Asians are not typically expected to fill.
Commentators at the NACAC conference were shocked by how an applicant’s race could be referenced in such an inappropriate way, but many counselors defended such action by pointing out that these kinds of statements are the only way for them to distinguish their students from the rapidly growing pool of Asian applicants. Rather than challenging the bias in the system, they hope to utilize it in a way that helps their students appeal to the admissions boards.<br><br>
Ethnic stereotypes are nothing new in higher education, and they were even present in the early 1900’s when most institutions had few minority students. Jewish American students attending Harvard excelled academically and earned a disproportionate share of awards and elections to Phi Beta Kappa. For their success, they were regarded as being too competitive, unusually eager to excel in their studies, and criticized for their supposed lack of interest in extracurricular activities. Others accused them of being “clannish, socially unskilled and either unwilling or unable to fit in.” Many Asian Americans students are already quite familiar with these stereotypes.<br><br>
Harvard administrators grew increasingly aware of their “Jewish Problem” and took measures to address it. In 1920, Harvard’s president A. Lawrence Lowell proposed a quota limiting Jewish enrollment so that their numbers would not exceed 15 percent of the campus population. In defense of his proposal, Lowell argued, “The anti-Semitic feeling among the students is increasing, and it grows in proportion to the increase in the number of Jews. If their number should become 40% of the student body, the race feeling would become intense.” Lowell was firmly convinced that Harvard’s survival as an institution depended on a majority of its students coming from “old American stock.”<br><br>
No administrator after the Civil Rights movement would dare to use such language again. Unfortunately, while the rhetoric may have changed, the reality has not. Although most universities will deny having such policies, several studies have revealed that many of the nation’s top schools exhibit clear signs of discrimination and favoritism in their admissions process. One study conducted at Stanford compared the admittance rates for white and Asian applicants of similar academic and leadership rankings. The researchers concluded that white students were “significantly” more likely to be admitted than their Asian peers. Another study estimates that Asian students need to score at least 50 points higher on their SAT in order to receive the same consideration as white applicants. Asian American students are consistently being held to a higher standard to gain access to the same opportunities — just another example of preferential treatment given to those fortunate enough to be “true Americans.”<br><br>
In November 2005, the Wall Street Journal covered a phenomenon called the “New White Flight.” The article referred to a growing trend in which white families were leaving public schools with large populations of Asian students. White parents were uncomfortable with the idea of their children being regarded as “underachievers” while trying to compete with Asians academically. Although this topic does not deal directly with college admissions, it helps to illustrate an important point. It seems that in the land of opportunity, minority progress is only viewed favorably until it begins to threaten the interests of the majority. When it comes to education, the consensus seems to be that the “model minority” has come too far.<br><br>
If these issues are not properly addressed, future generations of Asian Americans will continue to face the harsh reality that their own race may serve as an obstacle to their college ambitions. They will be forced to fight an uphill battle through institutionalized discrimination, unrealistic generalizations, and the overall climate of ignorance and fear that have fueled racial tensions and hindered hopes for tolerance. In the end, it seems that progress in American society means simply being presented with a new set of challenges — challenges that must be met and overcome with the very skills and knowledge that we gain as students today. By taking this responsibility upon ourselves, will we be able to ensure a better system for those who follow in our footsteps.
