<p>By now, you probably feel as though you&#146;ve heard everyone&#146;s opinions 
  about the events on September 11. The American public, it seems, has been so 
  swayed by the simplistic rhetoric and is rallying around a &#145;war&#146; against 
  an as-yet-undetermined enemy. However, an important voice that has been muted 
  is that of the Muslim, Arab, and South Asian community, who have been the targets 
  of vicious hate crimes and harassment. To provide an opportunity for them to 
  be heard, I had a conversation with Russell Laurie* and Reema Dodin of the Muslim 
  Students Association, Kavneet Alag of the Sikh Students Association, and Adam 
  Bhaijee of Indus.</p>
<p> <b>How would you characterize the media coverage of the events on September 
  11?</b></p>
<p> RD: Early that morning, already you had people like Peter Jennings starting 
  to lead it in the direction of Arab groups. This is at a point when you have 
  certain state officials saying that they believed this was much too advanced 
  for any of these groups to accomplish and also that these groups are so monitored 
  by the CIA that it would be highly unlikely for these groups to be able to orchestrate 
  something without any hint of it occurring ahead of time. And still, they&#146;re 
  bringing in images from the West Bank without any context and without providing 
  the American public with any sort of background. </p>
<p>It&#146;s extremely irresponsible&#133;Because they already know that the anti-Arab, 
  anti-Muslim sentiment &#150; and we say anti-Arab, anti-Muslim because people 
  don&#146;t know the difference; they assume anyone that has certain characteristics 
  is in this grouping. All across America, people are feeling extremely violated 
  for the first time since Pearl Harbor. And a lot of them want to deal with it 
  in violent and paranoid ways.</p>
<p> RL*: Incidents like this feed into the Western perception that our enemy is 
  in that part of the world. Before evidence even got out about who possibly could 
  have done this, at 7am our time, Dan Rather was on CBS and was already starting 
  to put the blame on Islamic fundamentalists. Then he had the gall to say &#145;...despite 
  the fact that we don&#146;t have any evidence to support these claims&#133;&#146; 
  Once that idea has been introduced to the public, there&#146;s nothing you can 
  do about it. Even if it were found out later that it&#146;s, say Japanese terrorists 
  &#150; whatever &#150; everybody&#146;s still going to pursue Muslims, and people 
  who look like Muslims &#150; Sikhs, Indians, South Asians.</p>
<p>AB: I think the bigger thing is that no one ever talks about the context in 
  which it is happening. People refer to terrorists as evil people. Their acts 
  are very evil, but the context in which it happens is never discussed. The fact 
  that half of the world lives in poverty right now is ignored. That American 
  planes bomb other countries quite frequently is ignored. I&#146;m not saying 
  whether this or that is right or wrong, but people need to understand the context 
  in which terrorism happens and why it happens. All I&#146;ve heard is &#145;we&#146;re 
  at war&#146; and &#145;we&#146;ve got to hit them back hard&#146;, but honestly 
  you can bomb them to rubble, but if the context that leads to terrorism still 
  exists...I mean, there will be more born every day; so I think that&#146;s really 
  important.</p>
<p>RD: As Muslims have lived more in this country, more people are coming into 
  contact with them and there had been more of a comfort level. I think the idea 
  is that people tend to separate that though. For the average American, if they 
  know that Muslim guy at work, that was one thing; but they completely separate 
  that from things elsewhere. And I don&#146;t think that on a daily basis they 
  think about what is going on in Palestine or other places that is angering Muslim 
  groups. When this did happen, you start to see that problem surfacing &#150; 
  where there&#146;s an internal dichotomy for people.</p>
<p> AB: They tend to highlight Islamic fanaticism, but there are fanatics in every 
  religion. Two days later, Jerry Falwell was saying that this thing was brought 
  upon by God due to the actions of secularist Americans [and abortionists, feminists, 
  gays and lesbians, the ACLU, and People for the American way] &#150; he&#146;s 
  blaming secularists! There are fundamentalists in every religion, but that&#146;s 
  never addressed.</p>
<p> RD: Again all the quotes coming out this week from politicians, and what many 
  Americans seem to believe, is the idea that America has been attacked for no 
  reason other than Muslims just hate them &#150; basically the brown people just 
  don&#146;t like Americans, for no reason...that America has done nothing wrong; 
  America has never violated these people in any way, shape, or form, ever.</p>
<p> RL*: Whatever xenophobia or Islam-aphobia that existed within the U.S. is now 
  very quickly coming to the surface. Ann Coulter, a nationally syndicated columnist, 
  has come out and said that we should kill the Muslim leaders, we should kick 
  them all out and that we should convert their leaders to Christianity. Her article 
  is being read all over the country, and if you had no idea about Islam or the 
  Middle East and had no background in it, like most Americans, your idea of Islam 
  is already formed in a very negative light which will probably never change 
  unless something drastic were to happen.</p>
<p> AB: I think it&#146;s important to stress the fact that US policy has done 
  some bad things, but still most Muslims &#150; no matter what &#150; have complete 
  abhorrence towards those acts. I&#146;m Muslim myself and after [watching] that 
  video on TV, I honestly felt a lot of anger towards those people who decided 
  that 6000 innocent civilians had to die. I believe that no cause, or no injustice 
  warrants the death of 6000 innocent civilians.</p>
<p><b> What went through your mind when you first heard the news [about the planes 
  crashing into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon]?</b></p>
<p> RL*: I was trying to fall asleep after the morning prayer. I was thinking to 
  myself, What is this bad War of the Worlds-type program? I realized that it 
  was Dan Rather and that this was real. All of a sudden, I started thinking about 
  my friends and family in New York. Some of them work in the World Trade Center, 
  and some work on Wall Street &#150; what was going on with them? My mother was 
  in Pakistan, and she was supposed to come here. My dad was supposed to fly to 
  New York on Wednesday...</p>
<p>Immediately after that I started thinking, They&#146;re going to blame Islam, 
  what&#146;s going to happen to the Muslims? The worst fears were that it&#146;s 
  going to be a Muslim, and it&#146;s going to drastically change the position 
  of Muslims and Islamic work that has been done for the last 40 years in the 
  United States.</p>
<p>As American as Muslims want to be, they will always be different, they will 
  always be the &#145;Other.&#146; Instead of [Islam] being unique and different, 
  and special, it is being viewed in a very negative light. And it probably will 
  continue to be so, as long as they continue to show pictures of Osama bin Laden, 
  of Islamic terrorists, instead of focusing on what would make someone want to 
  kill themselves on a plane. People who had families, people who were married, 
  people who had children &#150; why would they want to sacrifice everything they 
  had and kill 5,000 other people along with them? Attention needs to be focused 
  on the conditions that lead people into undertaking these acts, and the U.S. 
  role in creating those conditions.</p>
<p> KA: I had woken up just after the first tower had fallen, and I realized that 
  this was a horrific act. Whatever US foreign policy had done to bring this about, 
  it just shook me &#150; like all Americans &#150; that somebody would dare attack 
  the U.S. The sheer number of life that I thought could be lost, and also the 
  fear of what would be hit next.</p>
<p> RD: My mom woke me up at 7am. Of course, I turn on the TV to see the towers 
  teetering. I think I was in shock. After that, I began to realize that I had 
  woken up and the entire world was different. I kept thinking that my children 
  would still suffer from the cultural ramifications. </p>
<p>As a Muslim, as a Palestinian, I don&#146;t have the luxury of just sitting 
  and purely mourning for the tragedy. On top of mourning, I have to think about 
  what will happen to the Palestinian people, whom I think are perpetual victims 
  of whatever else happens on this planet.</p>
<p>It was just this waiting to find out if it was a pile of Timothy McVeigh&#146;s, 
  which I was hoping. It shouldn&#146;t matter, because these are civilians that 
  have passed away; but what&#146;s sad is that, because of the ramifications, 
  it very much does matter. I remember spending the morning thinking that, forevermore, 
  this has been changed, for Muslims, for Arabs. In the end, my main fears that 
  now Israel has an open slate to do whatever they want. Then, on Tuesday, 10 
  Palestinians were killed. For that area of the world &#150; we think it&#146;s 
  bad here &#150; it was so bad there, and it will only get worse.</p>
<p>It&#146;s very tragic, because in the end many, many civilians in countries 
  like Afghanistan are going to die. They&#146;re just going to hit innocent civilians 
  who didn&#146;t have the money or resources to leave to Iran or Pakistan. Again, 
  you&#146;re just going to create new generations of people who are completely 
  willing to die for this cause because they have nothing. </p>
<p>No one wants to stop and think that these young men, in the prime of their 
  lives, choose to do this to themselves. Why? Because now you have 3 generations 
  of Palestinians born under occupation. They don&#146;t even know what it&#146;s 
  like to not live under Israeli rule. They&#146;re taught from the beginning 
  of their lives that they are not human; they are less than human, that they 
  have no rights. They watch as their fathers are humiliated and their mothers 
  are harassed. They watch from their refugee camps as these beautiful settlements 
  are being built. [Israeli settlers] get the prime land in the West Bank, they 
  get security zones, their own water, and their own roads. Every Palestinian 
  must carry an ID with them at all times. </p>
<p>Their schools can be shut down at any time. Maybe if you start to look at Palestinians 
  as human beings, you will stop the suicide bombers. Once you give people hope 
  and something to live and work for, they won&#146;t be so inclined to do this. 
  I think this came from people hitting a bottom.</p>
<p> AB: I felt as though I went to sleep and I woke up in Hell. Thousands of people 
  are dead. But I also felt that it wouldn&#146;t end there, probably more people 
  would die &#150; whether they are Americans, Muslims &#150; every life is precious.</p>
<p> <b>What implications do these events have for our communities in America (Muslim, 
  Arab American, Sikhs, and others)?</b></p>
<p> KA: The main thing is that we need to band together as a whole. People are 
  wanting to distance themselves. Some minorities are trying to say, &#145;we&#146;re 
  not Muslims.&#146; But that&#146;s not the Sikh approach. First, we&#146;re 
  condemning these acts, clearly. Whatever US policy was, and whether this was 
  a valid response, these acts are absolutely horrendous. Secondly, we need to 
  stress that Muslims, Sikhs, and everyone suffered in this as well. We&#146;re 
  all Americans. Violence against anybody is invalid&#133;</p>
<p>If you look back at Oklahoma city, you didn&#146;t see people going out and 
  beating up everyone who looked like Timothy McVeigh. That would have been 200 
  million people in this country. Whereas in this case, there have been numerous 
  incidents with Muslims, Sikhs, and others being abused. Violence against anyone 
  is absolutely unforgivable.</p>
<p> RL*: Within our community, because we look different, we dress different, our 
  appearance is different, we immediately have to come out on the defensive. </p>
<p>Immediately after thinking about my family and friends, I had to think about 
  the Muslim community because that&#146;s who is going to be most affected by 
  these actions. The thing with Islam is that immediately all these Islamic organizations 
  and mosques have to issue statements that condemn this. But when Timothy McVeigh 
  bombs the building [in Oklahoma City], the Protestant Church doesn&#146;t have 
  to come out and say &#145;We condemn this act&#146; &#150; because it&#146;s 
  known. </p>
<p>With Islam, it&#146;s the next boogeyman after the USSR, after communism. It&#146;s 
  what everyone points their fingers to.There are 6-7 million Muslims in America. 
  We vote, we pay taxes, and we obey the laws of this nation. But immediately, 
  we are put on the defensive as not being American enough. Whether this is done 
  by Muslims or not, it&#146;s beyond the point because people already have that 
  perception and will continue to have that perception. Whenever fanatics in any 
  religion commit any act in the name of that religion, that religion doesn&#146;t 
  have the blame against it. With Islam, people immediately put the blame on the 
  religion itself. Like there is something inherently wrong with the people who 
  adhere to this faith. This doesn&#146;t happen with any other religion.</p>
<p> Immediately Muslims are coming out and putting up flags on their stores. All 
  that shows is that we weren&#146;t American enough to begin with, so now we 
  have to become more American. That common perception is completely going in 
  the wrong direction.</p>
<p> KA: I think this gives us the opportunity to prove how American we are, and 
  also an opportunity to show people what our cultures and religions are about. 
  When these types of tragedies happen, I think its good that we&#146;re going 
  out and hanging a flag and mourning publicly. Now, we can go out and show support.</p>
<p> RL*: Muslims, Indians, Hindus, Sikhs &#150; we have different moral, cultural, 
  and religious beliefs than the mainstream US cultural beliefs. But I don&#146;t 
  feel that we have to sacrifice those beliefs now or ever, because that&#146;s 
  what America is about. I think the idea that we have to assimilate, that we 
  have to fit in more &#150; I think that&#146;s absolutely absurd. Why should 
  we sacrifice our beliefs for the sake of anybody? You shouldn&#146;t have to 
  sacrifice those just because there&#146;s pressure upon you that &#145;Hey, 
  you&#146;re different.&#146; But that&#146;s what America is founded upon. It 
  wasn&#146;t founded upon the idea that we are all one people, that we all look 
  the same, that we all have the same name.</p>
<p> KA: There&#146;s no marginalizing of beliefs in showing somebody that you&#146;re 
  grieving. As Sikhs, we don&#146;t want to distance ourselves from Muslims or 
  Hindus or from anyone else who is suffering, because that&#146;s anti-Sikh. 
  We are trying to go across the board and stop any type of violence against people, 
  period. So banding together with Muslims is one of the things we are doing on 
  this campus and across the country. We&#146;ve said to everybody not to change 
  your lifestyles, but take some more caution in what you do. </p>
<p>We are in America, and most of us are never &#145;going back.&#146; I think 
  its good to show some sort of community. That doesn&#146;t mean that we are 
  supporting all the policies of America. Obviously, America has done some things 
  and the policies are not the greatest. By the same token, the common decency 
  and morality of all of us should mourn the lives lost. It seems we have walls 
  between our communities &#150; between the whites, the Jews, the Muslims, the 
  Sikhs, the Hindus, and even within our own communities. This can serve as something 
  to bridge it. We may be different, but we all have something in common. We all 
  abhor violence, and we can begin to mourn this and try to become stronger. </p>
<p><b>How do you respond to people who claim that there is something inherent 
  in Islam that leads to terrorist acts?</b></p>
<p> RD: Start with the fact that Muslims are people. Islam is a religion that 
  teaches you patience, peace. It teaches you not to get angry, at every level. 
  If people really want to know Islam, they need to go and look at the Koran. 
  They need to look at what we study, because that is the ideal. Now, Muslims 
  don&#146;t always represent Islam. Muslims are practitioners, and they are sometimes 
  imperfect practitioners. </p>
<p>Islam does also teach that you must defend yourself. You cannot lie down and 
  allow yourself, your home, your property, your family, and your people to be 
  consistently oppressed.</p>
<p> [The events in NYC and DC] are completely unacceptable. This is not Islam. 
  This is an act done in the name of people who were politically inclined and 
  were motivated because of their state of life.</p>
<p> AB: I want to stress the fact there are fanatics in every religion. There 
  are Christians who blow up abortion clinics. It&#146;s really found everywhere. 
  The actions of a few don&#146;t reflect the majority. </p>
<p><b>Would you say that you are generally optimistic or pessimistic, with regard 
  to your respective community in America?</b></p>
<p> KA: I think I share in the view that it&#146;s going to get worse before it&#146;s 
  going to get better. The first report of a Sikh being killed was September 15 
  in Arizona. It wasn&#146;t the biggest surprise, and I feel like, &#145;OK, 
  it has started now.&#146; There have been a number of reports of Sikhs being 
  beaten.</p>
<p> I was really pessimistic about it, and then with the rhetoric of &#145;We&#146;re 
  going to attack them...we&#146;re going to smoke them out of their holes...we&#146;re 
  going to end their state.&#146; I wonder how that&#146;s going to transcribe 
  itself onto the citizens. What is the average citizen going to think? The average 
  citizen doesn&#146;t know the difference between a Sikh, a Muslim, a Hindu. 
  What&#146;s that going to do? If these are the constant images, and then we 
  declare war...Everyone obviously wants to seek some sort of revenge, and maybe 
  that&#146;s human nature, but if the U.S. does attack Afghanistan, what are 
  Americans going to think? Are they also going to want to take their own revenge?</p>
<p> RL*: The media and the U.S. government have created the &#145;Other&#146;, 
  and we as Americans who are different physically, appearance-wise, culturally, 
  religiously, have become that &#145;Other&#146; within this country. That&#146;s 
  why we are being attacked. </p>
<p>Whereas before you could have the average citizen saying, &#145;Sanjit is different, 
  he runs the gas station.&#146; All of a sudden now, &#145;He&#146;s the same 
  person who they&#146;re blaming on television! George Bush is saying that we 
  are going to smoke out those terrorists. Could he be a possible terrorist?&#146; 
  That&#146;s the sort of mentality that is pervading mainstream America. That&#146;s 
  why Muslims, Sikhs, and Hindus are getting attacked. That&#146;s why people 
  who don&#146;t look &#145;American&#146;, who aren&#146;t white with blonde 
  hair and blue eyes are being attacked &#150; for not being American enough. 
</p>
<p>RD: I think it will get worse before it gets better. But I hope it will get 
  better. I&#146;m hoping that on the other side of this, there will be greater 
  unity. In the short run, I just hope that Muslims practice common sense to minimize 
  the negativity that they are exposed to. I hope that history will be a reasonable 
  critic and judge of the next few months. </p>
<p>I wonder how this will affect my generation as we move out to get jobs, integrate 
  into society, and develop our own families. I wonder if a guy named &#145;Mohammed&#146; 
  can get a job next year graduating with a degree in computer science. It will 
  be very interesting to see on a micro level, how my generation will be affected 
  this.</p>
<p> AB: Regarding South Asians and Arabs, I&#146;m pretty pessimistic in the short 
  term, but I&#146;m cautiously optimistic for the long term. I personally feel 
  that in the next few months &#150; actually for the next few years, it&#146;s 
  going to get pretty bad. We just have to be careful, realize it&#146;s going 
  to be bad, but pray for the best. I have hope that even though it&#146;s bad 
  right now, in the future it will get better.</p>
<p> RL*: I think one good thing that&#146;s come out of this is that all student 
  groups on campus have come together and are working conjointly to help stop 
  Islam-aphobia, Arab-phobia, and widespread xenophobia amongst Americans, even 
  on the Berkeley campus. </p>
