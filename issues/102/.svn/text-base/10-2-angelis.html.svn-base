    <i>
    America has power, but not justice.<br>
In prison, we were victimized as if we were guilty.<br>
Given no opportunity to explain, it was really brutal.<br>
I bow my head in reflection but there is nothing I can do.<br>
— from the walls of the barracks of Angel Island<br><br>

The insects chirp outside the four walls.<br>
The inmates often sigh.<br>
Thinking of affairs back home,<br>
Unconscious tears wet my lapel.<br>
— from the walls of the barracks of Angel Island<br><br>

Imprisoned in the wooden building day after day,<br>
My freedom withheld; how can I bear to talk about it?<br>
I look to see who is happy but they only sit quietly.<br>
I am anxious and depressed and cannot fall asleep.<br>
The days are long and the bottle constantly empty; my sad mood, even so, is not dispelled<br>
Nights are long and the pillow cold; who can pity my loneliness?<br>
After experiencing such loneliness and sorrow,<br>
Why not just return home and learn to plow the fields?<br>
— from the walls of the barracks of Angel Island<br><br>

    Walk through the halls of the Angel Island Immigration Station today; you will see its wooden barracks closed off to the public for restoration. Go back thirty years; these same barracks are closed off and on the brink of demolition until a park ranger notices etchings in the walls of the rooms. Go back eighty years; detained Chinese immigrants, dejected and anxiously waiting to move into their new homeland, begin carving into the walls of their holding facility. The writings on the walls are poems, expressing the physical and emotional isolation felt by their authors for being kept on this foreign island. They serve as a powerful reminder of immigrant struggles in the early 20th century.      <p><br>
The various anti-Chinese exclusion laws passed in the late 19th century had greatly increased the difficulty Chinese immigrants encountered when trying to get into the US. With each subsequent act, old loopholes were closed and new immigrants had to resort to other means. The 1906 San Francisco Earthquake provided one such opening. The city’s municipal records were destroyed, allowing many Chinese to claim they had been born in the United States. Wives and children of citizens were permitted by law to enter the country, and many young men, posing as the sons of American citizens, attempted to gain entry. Those who tried to come through San Francisco ended up on Angel Island.      <p><br>
Angel Island, located in the middle of the San Francisco Bay, served as the first stop for thousands of immigrants from Asia heading to California, the majority of whom were Chinese. From 1910 to 1940, the Angel Island Immigration Station processed and detained approximately 170,000 Chinese immigrants, for as short as a few days or as long as two years. The station was created to address complaints about the unsanitary conditions of the previous immigration building, as well as to isolate the Chinese immigrants from the rest of society. Angel Island did little to assuage concerns over cleanliness; in 1919, federal troops had to be called into the station to control a riot on the island, after the immigrants had protested the poor quality of the food. Over the years, numerous community groups and immigration officials declared the facilities inadequate and unhealthy, leading to a declaration in 1922 by the Assistant Secretary of Labor and Commissioner General of Immigration that the facilities were "filthy and unfit for habitation." However, the station remained in operation until 1940, when a fire destroyed one of the buildings.      <p><br>
When the immigrants first arrived on the island, officials segregated them by ethnicity and gender. Men were kept in separate barracks from the women and children, which meant husbands usually had no contact with their wives and children until they made it past inspection. The immigrants would then have to go through medical checks, stripped naked and prodded by strangers testing for parasitic infections. Originally, those who had some proscribed disease were deported immediately, but after protests from Chinese community leaders, immigration officials provided some with medical treatment. Following a satisfactory examination, the immigrants were placed into barracks, where they awaited their immigration hearings.      <p><br>
Immigration cases were heard by a panel of inspectors, government authorities who determined the legitimacy of each applicant’s claims to entry. To verify these claims, the inspectors listened to testimony from the applicant and his or her witness, usually a family member living in the US, and drilled them on obscure details regarding home villages and family history. The questions, sometimes as irrelevant as "How many steps were there to the front door of your house?", prompted incoming immigrants to smuggle information books which they memorized and then destroyed to avoid discovery. Because of the potential threats of random checks and future immigration raids, those who made it to San Francisco had to retain this knowledge for their entire lives.      <p><br>
While waiting for their cases to be heard, the immigrants were essentially inmates in a prison; their contact with the outside world was extremely limited, and most spent their days confined in their quarters. The men were prohibited from walking the grounds, limited mostly to small, fenced-in recreation yards. Still, the immigrants found ways to pass the time: they took English classes provided by members of Chinatown, listened to Chinese opera records on a phonograph that they had bought, and formed organizations to help welcome new immigrants and to serve as liaisons with station officials. They also often wrote poetry, written in paint or carved into the wood of the barracks.      <p><br>
These poems, usually written in classical Chinese style, served as a means of expression for the immigrants. The immigration ordeal left many angry, hopeless, and lonely. They were unsure whether they would ever see their families again, unsure whether they would ever be able to leave the island. For those who came to America looking for Gam Saan (Gold Mountain), it was a shock to be imprisoned with thousands of other immigrants in unsafe facilities for weeks and months on end. The poems may not be stylistically impressive (many poets borrowed from other Chinese poems or other poems found in the barracks), but the content found within them provides us with an insight into the general sense of despair and isolation these immigrants felt.      <p><br>
Following the 1940 fire that destroyed the facility’s administration building, the Angel Island Immigration Station was put out of service and used to hold Japanese and German prisoners of war. In 1943, the US government repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act, given China’s status as an ally to the West in World War II. The station was set for demolition until a park ranger happened to see the poems on the walls of the barracks. Preservation efforts soon followed and the station was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Today, "Partners in Preservation," a program funding preservation efforts across the nation, is offering $100,000 to renovate one historic site in the Bay Area. People can vote online (www.partnersinpreservation.com) for the Angel Island Immigration Station, with the voting ending October 31st.      <p><br>
For the immigrants who were able to pass the inspection board, many stayed in San Francisco to find work and housing in Chinatown. They would carry resentment towards Angel Island and the humiliating and dehumanizing ordeal they had gone through for most of their lives. For those who did not pass the board, about ten percent of all the Chinese immigrants, they were forced out of the country, back to the land they had intended to leave. Some would not make the trip back; some among the deported committed suicide while in the barracks or aboard the ships.
It takes no great stretch of imagination to draw parallels between the treatment of Chinese immigrants within and outside Angel Island, and our current government’s policies and attitudes towards the debate over Mexican immigrants, the unlawful detention of Muslims post-9/11, and the experiences of Karen refugees from Burma. To see history repeated again and again is frustrating to many activists fighting against consistent oppression and racism. But confronting these patterns becomes less difficult when the voices of the oppressed remain etched into walls.      <p><br>
