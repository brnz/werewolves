    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> As a privileged academic 
        vagabond, I spent four years in Singapore to complete my secondary school 
        degree. One day on my way to school, the Singaporean taxi-driver asked 
        me where I was from. Already knowing where the conversation was going, 
        I reluctantly told him that I was Indonesian. Predictably, he continued 
        to ask me if I could speak Chinese and upon hearing my negative reply, 
        he started reprimanding me for not preserving my Chinese roots: &#8220;Aiya! 
        You don&#8217;t speak Chinese in Indonesia, is it? Those natives are horrible. 
        How can they ban the ethnic Chinese from speaking their own language? 
        Look at you &#8212; you&#8217;re Chinese, not Indonesian! If you were 
        Indonesian you wouldn&#8217;t be persecuted by your own countrymen.&#8221; 
        <br>
        <br>
        I was undoubtedly outraged by his condescending comments towards my country, 
        but for the most part, I was disturbed by the fact that I was disturbed. 
        The driver&#8217;s remarks made me think of something that I hadn&#8217;t 
        really thought much of before: What exactly am I? Am I Chinese or Indonesian? 
        Does the language that I speak determine my cultural background? I felt 
        strongly for Indonesia but I was not quite sure why. I was born Indonesian 
        but I grew up knowing only Chinese norms and values. I was Indonesian 
        mainly because I spoke Indonesian, ate Indonesian food and, well, lived 
        in Indonesia. After all, I don&#8217;t really know that many native pribumis 
        &#8212; I went to an almost all Chinese primary school and all my neighbors 
        were Chinese. I was never really interested in finding out more about 
        Indonesia, but that is probably because we were already being spoon-fed 
        with ridiculous volumes of Indonesian history and constitutional records. 
        I had no complaints about the distinct socio-economic division between 
        the ethnic Chinese and the pribumis because I thought that was how things 
        had always been. It was only during the 1998 riots when I realized how 
        fatal the conflict was.<br>
        <br>
        Indonesia was under the dictatorial rule of Suharto for the longest time. 
        It was only a matter of time before a dramatic revolt would occur to topple 
        his regime. The effort culminated in 1998 when hundreds of students organized 
        a series of demonstrations demanding the corrupt president to step down. 
        The demonstrations took a nasty turn, however, when native mobs took advantage 
        of the tumultuous atmosphere to vent their anger toward the Chinese Indonesians. 
        While the students were fighting for political reformation, these mobs 
        took matters into their hands. They broke into ethnic Chinese homes and 
        stores, looted and destroyed their properties, bullied the men, and raped 
        the women. Families were burned alive in their homes. The international 
        airport was swarmed with hundreds of people waiting for the next available 
        flight out of the country, if they were lucky enough to get to the airport. 
        Trucks of mobs blocked the road leading to the airport in an attempt to 
        prevent anyone from fleeing the country. It was easier for those with 
        the financial resources because they could bribe a few police officers 
        to escort them, but it did not do much to guarantee their safety.<br>
        <br>
        The 1998 riots proved that money was nothing but a cause for jealousy 
        and animosity. As a child, I knew that the ethnic Chinese were generally 
        more prosperous than the natives. The Chinese make up only four percent 
        of the total population but control up to seventy percent of the economy. 
        Chinese-owned Indonesian conglomerates possess immense amounts of wealth. 
        They own private banks and food industries among many other industrial 
        giants. In fact, upper class figures are so prominent that the common 
        mass knows them by their first names only. These aristocrats drive European 
        cars, wear designer clothes, and live in exclusive residential complexes. 
        But wealth was pretty much the only thing that the Chinese possessed. 
        Even with all their material wealth, I have never seen but one Indonesian 
        Chinese in the parliament. This lack of political representation poses 
        an important question: Are the Chinese Indonesians really part of the 
        nation or are they there for purely hedonistic purposes? <br>
        <br>
        Whether they realize it or not, the Chinese Indonesian community has allowed 
        the Indonesian government to suppress their culture and stifle their voices 
        in exchange for material prosperity. As of today, there are still approximately 
        sixty laws that function to the disadvantage of the Chinese Indonesian 
        community. Not only did the government prohibit the formation of a Chinese 
        political party, it banned the production and importation of any printed 
        materials bearing Chinese characters. The Chinese are required to take 
        up Indonesian-sounding names and are given special codes put on their 
        identification cards to indicate ethnic Chinese origin. The establishment 
        of five officially recognized national religions, which include Islam, 
        Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism and Buddhism, rules out the possibility 
        for fundamental Chinese beliefs such as Confucianism to be freely embraced 
        by the community. Laws forbid Chinese religious festivals to be conducted 
        in public and limit the observation of Chinese traditions to within the 
        household. The government insists that the only reason behind the implementation 
        of these laws is to encourage assimilation, but that was never the case. 
        For example, Indonesians are obliged by law to use the derogatory term 
        &#8220;Cina&#8221; to address the ethnic Chinese instead of the preferred 
        term &#8220;Tionghoa.&#8221; This institutionalized racism dispels the 
        euphemism that the government puts forth to veil its prejudice against 
        its small-eyed, fair-skinned citizens. Power is obviously something that 
        the Indonesian government is not willing to share with its ethnic Chinese 
        citizens.<br>
        <br>
        It is true that the Chinese dominate most of the economy, but they don&#8217;t 
        really have much say in determining their own future. The almost non-existent 
        ethnic Chinese presence in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches 
        speaks volumes about the lack of good faith and interaction between the 
        Chinese and native Indonesians. It would be fair to mention that some 
        progress had been made during Abdurrahman Wahid&#8217;s brief presidency 
        from 1999 to 2001, but he only repealed one of these oppressive laws. 
        Now the Chinese Indonesians get to openly celebrate Chinese New Year again, 
        but should they be all grateful just because they are entitled to enjoy 
        what is inherently a basic human right? Yes, Chinese New Year is now officially 
        recognized as a national holiday and yes, the officials do go around wearing 
        traditional Chinese attire, but only after hundreds have been physically 
        and mentally harassed. Those who could afford to leave have fled the country 
        in search of a better, more secure life wherever it is, be it in Singapore, 
        America or even China. Are those who were once persecuted now embraced 
        as part of the nation only after most of them have fled the country carrying 
        billions of dollars with them and thus upsetting the economic pillar of 
        the country? <br>
        <br>
        There is no doubt that something has to be done to remedy the situation. 
        It is important that the Chinese establish their identity within the Indonesian 
        society, so they can advance not only as private business owners but also 
        as citizens of the nation. Minor steps have been taken to raise awareness 
        within the Chinese community, but equality is still a far fetched idea. 
        Even if there is progress, it is slow indeed. It is only if members of 
        the Chinese Indonesian community are willing to educate themselves and 
        actively participate in the struggle to propose equality within their 
        own country will harmony be achieved. It is up to the youth who have been 
        exposed to this imminent crisis to determine the fate of the country, 
        for they are the future politicians, historians, journalists, and business 
        owners. The first step of obtaining higher education is already evident 
        in the presence of several Chinese Indonesians in the international student 
        body here in Berkeley, as well as at other academic institutions worldwide. 
        But whether or not they will be willing to contribute their services toward 
        the progress of their home country is another question. It is instrumental 
        that the interests of Chinese Indonesians are taken into consideration 
        and included in the national political agenda if Indonesia is to become 
        a true democratic country. Who better to fulfill this task but the Chinese 
        Indonesians themselves? <br>
        <br>
        In spite of the difficulties faced by the Chinese Indonesians, Indonesia 
        is still their motherland. Indonesia is the place where they grow up, 
        where they have some of their fondest memories. It is what shapes their 
        identity and makes them distinct from other ethnic Chinese groups. It 
        is imperative that the Chinese Indonesians fight for their rightful place 
        in their own country.</p>
