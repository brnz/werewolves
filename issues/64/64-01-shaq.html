    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p>In the NBA, talk is cheap. 
        Respect is earned on the court, not in the newspapers, or by the fans. 
        Franchises are run like a business and hype and drama sell tickets. When 
        the Houston Rockets took the 2001 draft pick, no team had players to battle 
        the reigning NBA Champions&#8217; center Shaquille O&#8217;Neal. At 7&#8217;1&#8221; 
        300+ lbs. he dominated the league with size, power and explosiveness. 
        But the Rockets took a chance on a tall, promising center from China and 
        the talk began.<br>
        <br>
        Yao Ming was 21 years old, 7&#8217;5&#8221;, 296 lbs., and could shoot 
        jump shots. He had an international game of finesse and sportsmanship 
        (often lost in the NBA). After the domination of Shaq, Yao Ming became 
        the answer. Their rivalry followed the likes of Wilt Chamberlain and Bill 
        Russell and the media ate it up. But before their highly anticipated meeting 
        on January 17th, sports talk shows revealed tape of Shaq making kung-fu 
        expressions when asked about the rivalry. He told reporters in mock Chinese 
        language, &#8220;Tell Yao Ming &#8216;ching chong ying wahh&#8230;&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        There was a dual response from the Asian community. Many said Shaq and 
        his remarks were racist. Many shrugged it off as another racial clash 
        and ducked heads. Yao Ming humorously dismissed the comments, stating 
        that even he had trouble learning Chinese when younger. Some Asian American 
        groups furiously sent emails and organized protests at basketball games. 
        Oddly enough, their responses rarely appeared on national media. Instead, 
        KCAL TV broadcasters interviewed a popular local LA Chinese restaurant 
        owner before the game. In wake of Yao Ming&#8217;s arrival, there have 
        been fortune cookie distributions and dragon dances during games. The 
        success of an Asian basketball player has thrust the Asian stereotype 
        into the spotlight.<br>
        <br>
        But can we really pin Shaquille O&#8217;Neal with outright racism for 
        these comments? His words do not express hate, but ignorance. These stereotypes 
        draw from something larger. Some of Hollywood&#8217;s most lucrative comedy, 
        including Jackie Chan movies &#8220;Shanghai Noon&#8221; or &#8220;Rush 
        Hour&#8221; exploit the same Asian characterizations. Media and entertainment 
        saturate America&#8217;s perspectives, and it is not clear that Shaq should 
        carry the backlash alone. Shaq apologized shortly after his interviews 
        were replayed and explained it was his lame attempt at a joke. By all 
        appearances, he merely tried to emulate the pop culture that has made 
        him a star. He was wrong, but given the context of the combatant face 
        offs of pro sports, it is fair to note Shaq takes abuse on and off the 
        court but keeps his large fists to himself.<br>
        <br>
        The Asian American response to this incident was too extreme: either too 
        vicious or too small. Calling Shaq racist and pointing fingers does not 
        address the larger attitude toward Asian Americans. Shaq is a media darling, 
        with legions of fans. The protests fell on largely dismissive or confused 
        ears. Passivity, however, is its own inherent evil. If the Asian American 
        community wants clout, it needs unity, but even more so, precision: we 
        need to pick our battles, we need to qualify our enraged accusations. 
        It was right to draw attention, but vindicating a celebrity will do little 
        to change popular opinion. <br>
        <br>
        The minority presence in professional sports is still a taboo subject. 
        It is encouraging for Asians to see Yao Ming as a real contender in the 
        NBA, but businesses and the public have had an unsteady response. The 
        average person&#8217;s understanding of Asian culture comes from larger 
        media stereotypes or personal experience. If personal experience is limited, 
        then Asian culture is limited to fortune cookies and dragon dances.<br>
        <br>
        O&#8217;Neal is not absolved of perpetuating the stereotypes that Asian 
        Americans continue to face today. He is like a national hero, a role model 
        for the youth, and was recently presented with an NAACP award for leadership. 
        Yet he, like too much of America, sees Asian Americans as simply the kung 
        fu fighting machines. And we see the sponsors provide the fans with fortune 
        cookies during a Miami game, to celebrate Yao&#8217;s presence. Many people, 
        even Yao, brushed this whole incident as simply a joke. But Yao is not 
        Asian American, he is Asian. He is not familiar with America society&#8217;s 
        contentious and complex inter-racial situation.<br>
        <br>
        With time, the Yao Ming craze may fade, or another young Asian player 
        will join him on the court. But because he is the first Asian, there will 
        inevitably be bumps in the road. Shaq most likely learned something from 
        this issue (even if Mandarin and Cantonese are different) and hopefully, 
        so did the public.</p>
