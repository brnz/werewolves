Over President’s Day weekend, hundreds of South Asian youths converged at the Kaiser Convention Center in Oakland for the annual Dhol Di Awaaz Bhangra dance competition. Now, whether they acknowledge it or not, the participants are taking part in a process of historical and cultural revision.

      Bhangra in the US is a political statement; it favors an interpretation of Indian culture and history that does not allow for the discussion of wrongs committed against the disenfranchised.

<p> 
Bhangra, for those that do not know, is a dance form closely associated with the harvest festivals in the Punjab region of South Asia -- the South Asian equivalent of California’s Central Valley. Bhangra’s popularity in the West comes from its stint in the clubs of the UK and then by the interest of South Asian youths here in the US. The thumping bass tracks of bhangra makes it pre-destined for success in the West, where bhangra has been fused into various musical genres. Various college campuses now hold bhangra dance competitions where teams representing different schools compete.</p>
<p>
What’s interesting about bhangra is that it takes us back to a time in South Asian history, to rural areas, where crops were plentiful, where people were happy and had plenty of causes to celebrate. Now, this pastoral South Asia is an immigrant fantasy borne out of South Asian Americans’ dreaming of an idyllic Indian past. What bhangra does, in a way, is to present a conservative interpretation of Indian history in which the glaring problems in the rural areas are overlooked. Issues like the inequity of landownership, class conflict, the displacement of peasants, a history of famine, and the gross neglect by the Indian state and society of the rural poor are brushed away by the desire of South Asians to dream of their homeland in romantic terms.</p>
<p>
You’re probably saying: How did you get all that from a dance?
</p>
<p>I know it is not the job of entertainment events to educate people. I am well aware that one does not go to a cultural or social event to receive a lecture in history. I wouldn’t go to a rap concert and expect to be lectured on Atlantic slavery. But those with progressive vision must acknowledge that the events we hold and the things we celebrate about our culture must make it possible for us to gain a real sense of our history, even the ugliest aspects of it.
</p>
<p>As we speak, the rural poor in India are being displaced from their lands by large corporate agri-business interests. These people are then forced into India’s urban slums, where they will serve as cheap labor that will supposedly drive the country’s development. Of course, this displacement is nothing new. In the latter part of the 19th century, it is documented that approximately 60,000 Punjabis a month were forced from their lands because upper-caste landowners, under the administration of a British imperial system, saw it fit to demand greater rents from their tenants. And those are statistics for just one state in northern India.
</p>
<p>When India gained its independence from Britain in 1947, the new government immediately recognized the crucial nature of land reforms to providing all Indians with the ability to secure their economic well-being. However, the government was fought every step of the way by the upper-caste elites of India, who refused to let peasant farmers become viable on their own for fear of losing their stronghold on landownership.
</p>
<p>Mexico is similar in class dynamic and history to India. And those identified with the Chiapas movement in southern Mexico are essentially fighting in Mexico, to right the same kinds of problems that plague rural India. While these issues are not identical, there are many similarities, suggesting that these problems exist in the same form in many parts of the globe.
</p>
<p>It is not a quirk, but rather a legacy of class oppression and colonial rule that most South Asian immigrants in this country are of high caste. It is because these families parlayed their standing in Indian society to negotiate perks from the British administration in India. Those with land or other forms of social capital translated their position into college educations at Western universities for their children. In return, they acted as British proxies, protecting colonial interests in India. And it was this educated Indian elite that was first to seek its opportunities abroad in places like the US.
</p>
<p>Without my even having raised a critical voice, bhangra in the US is a political statement; it favors a middle-class-friendly interpretation of Indian culture and history, one that does not allow for the discussion of wrongs committed against the disenfranchised of the subcontinent.
</p>
<p>What bhangra does, more than any other South Asian related event, is draw masses. So, I am not saying do away with it simply because it looks back to a past that did not exist. However, if it is retooled to include some of the historical and present-day realities of life in rural India, it can go a lot farther in being an authentic cultural experience for everyone.
</p>
<p>Bringing a dose of reality in how we, as South Asian Americans, portray India may seem insignificant, yet it can have a wider impact. For some reason, the actions of South Asians here in America carry an exceptional amount of clout for those in India. Raising a banner of progressive action here can only help to encourage those in India to do the same. And in the end, raising that banner only helps us because it provides us with a truer sense of who we are and fosters an understanding of the world that encourages a struggle for social justice.
