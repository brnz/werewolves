<p>UC Berkeley&#146;s Asian American Studies department is arguably one of the 
  country&#146;s most well known programs of its kind. Its experts are frequently 
  consulted for their take on Asian American issues, while students and scholars 
  gather at their feet in hopes of partaking in their wisdom. As high profile 
  as the faculty and department are, however, their inadequacies in providing 
  for the Pilipino American community &#151; the second largest Asian American 
  group in the nation &#151; bring shame to not only the department, but the University 
  as well.</p>
<p>According to the 2000 census results, Pilipino Americans make up 18% of the 
  country&#146;s Asian American population, behind only Chinese Americans. A good 
  portion resides right here in California, especially the Bay Area. And yet one 
  would never know of the community&#146;s significance by looking at Berkeley&#146;s 
  Asian American Studies faculty. In terms of representation, Japanese, Chinese, 
  Korean, and even the burgeoning Southeast Asian American community have faces 
  and experts to look up to in the department. Pilipino students on the other 
  hand, see no faces like their own in any department but Nutritional Science.</p>
<p>The need for a ladder-rank Pilipino American professor goes beyond mere numbers 
  and representation. What happens to Pilipino Americans can be studied in relation 
  to other ethnic minorities. &#147;The relationship between Pilipinos and America 
  is like a litmus test,&#148; said Raissa Diamente, a core member of the student 
  group Committee for Pilipino American Studies (ComPASs). &#147;It&#146;s a test 
  case for history.&#148; Indeed, the Philippines has one of the most long and 
  complex histories of Western colonization. The effects of imperialism persist 
  today, as evidenced in Pilipino culture and traditions. Closer to campus, Pilipino 
  Americans were the first ethnic group to be dropped from Affirmative Action 
  in 1989. According to a Statement of Concern written in 1996 by Pilipino Academic 
  Student Services, this move resulted in a 36.7% drop in Pilipino admits from 
  the applicant pool from 1989-1996, the biggest drop of all ethnic minority groups 
  during that period. Once again, Pilipino Americans served as the &#147;litmus 
  test&#148; for the effects of the removal of Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>With at least 700 Pilipino students and seven highly active Pilipino organizations 
  on campus, the time has come to provide a Pilipino ladder-rank faculty member 
  who can study and teach students about the Pilipino experience. To the Ethnic 
  Studies department&#146;s credit, they&#146;ve been trying for the past ten 
  years to secure the money for the position, placing a request for funding in 
  their budget each year. Each time, however, their attempts have been thwarted 
  by either the University, which must approve each allotment for new faculty, 
  or because of issues internal to the department itself. Timing has also been 
  one of the main obstacles to the search. &#147;It has taken time to work out 
  which programs would be allotted FTE [Full Time Equivalent]. Both Chicano and 
  Native American Studies experienced more retirements and more people quitting 
  than Asian American Studies,&#148; said Elaine Kim, a professor in Asian American 
  Studies and a big supporter of the effort. In addition to Asian American Studies 
  faculty, Pilipino American students have also done their part by continuously 
  urging the campus administration and Ethnic Studies to act. </p>
<p>Considering their numbers, Pilipino students have proved to be one of the most 
  active Asian American groups on campus. When Amado Cabezas was denied tenure 
  in the Department of Ethnic Studies in 1992, undergraduate and graduate students 
  formed an ad hoc committee to investigate the case and launched a campaign for 
  redress. In just one semester, the group was able to gather support and attention 
  in the forms of 3,000 letters written to Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien, a demonstration 
  in front California Hall, and meetings with the Chancellor and then-Provost 
  Carol Christ. Their efforts, however, were not enough to secure Cabezas&#146; 
  position. This year when Ethnic Studies takes another stab at requesting funding, 
  they will again be backed by a group of well-organized and determined students. 
  ComPASs was formed last spring as a way to organize students and allow continuity 
  in the fight to establish Pilipino American Studies. They&#146;ve played an 
  important role in conducting research on Pilipino American Studies, gathering 
  information about the urgency of bringing to Berkeley an expert in the area. 
  One of the committee&#146;s short terms goals is to organize a conference focusing 
  on Pilipino American Studies with the hopes of attracting more attention from 
  the University and academia in general. The road they&#146;ve traveled since 
  last Spring has been a rough one, including a mix of successful and failed attempts 
  to gather support from within the University and Ethnic Studies. The students 
  have already had to sustain one let-down this past summer when they were told 
  that although the funding had been attained for the position last Spring, the 
  search for a professor would not begin this Fall as planned.</p>
<p>And so the cycle will begin again. ComPASs has already secured the definite 
  support of the Ethnic Studies Department and its chairman, Jose Saldivar, and 
  Letters and Sciences Dean George Breslauer, both of whom have said the effort 
  is their &#147;highest priority&#148; according to Dexter Ligot-Gordon of ComPASs. 
  The final step is the approval by the University&#146;s Budget Committee of 
  the allotment for the position. This may prove to be the toughest gate to pass 
  through, however, as has been the case for several years in the past. &#147;I 
  think the biggest challenge will be to find someone whose scholarship and qualifications 
  will be recognized by the Budget Committee,&#148; said Professor Kim, who believes 
  that this will be the year the request will be granted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Budget Committee won&#146;t decide on the issue until late 
  Spring 2002. Even if they approve the funding, the search for a professor won&#146;t 
  start until Summer 2002, which means that a professor won&#146;t be in place 
  until Fall 2003, according to ComPASs projections. In the meantime, ComPASs 
  and its core, composed primarily of juniors and seniors, will continue its efforts. 
  &#147;We&#146;re working for something we&#146;ll never see,&#148; said Ligot-Gordon. 
  Still, it is important work that will benefit all of the future students at 
  Cal, both Pilipino Americans or otherwise.</p>
