<p>About 30 students attended a hate-crime forum hosted by Indus and moderated 
  by professor Kiren Chaudhry. Held on seventh floor Eshleman, the forum provided 
  a space of discussion for a community of students who express a diversity of 
  opinions to demonstrate their solidarity in a common concern, while simultaneously 
  asserting their various different ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Many students shared similar anecdotes about their experiencing distance from 
  white Americans since September 11th, especially students who came from suburban 
  areas where they felt they mixed in pretty well with their white neighbors pre-September 
  11. Some expressed concerns in discussing international relations and US foreign 
  policy, fearing that they would be considered un-American and risk phycial danger 
  if they do so.</p>
<p>An interesting point of discussion arose when South Asian students express 
  their solidarity with Arab Americans, saying that even though now that South 
  Asian political coalitions are forming to teach more Americans about Sikh Americans, 
  Hindu Americans and Muslim Americans, few try to say &#147;I am not Arab&#148; 
  or &#147;I am not Muslim&#148; Yet others are concerned that these cross-ethnic 
  solidarity to counteract racial lumping are often short-live because they only 
  form when immediate physical danger is involved and are quite ephemeral considering 
  much conflict still exist between various South Asian groups. </p>
<p>On a whole the forum raised more questions on the complexity of issues surrounding 
  September 11th such as : How does 9.11 test our capacity to distinguish between 
  film and reality? Why are Americans, so proud of the belief that someone is 
  innocent before proven guilty, are so eager for revenge when no hard evidence 
  has been presented? How does US foreign policy relate to the occurrence of hate 
  crimes? Does patriotism mean supporting the current government and the mainstream 
  political stance? Or does patriotism mean holding up to the ideals of the US 
  constitution even when that means speaking out against the government? Is Islamic 
  Fundamentalism the real root of the problem? Why are there not more teach-in&#146;s 
  about the socio-economic and the geo-political implications of American presence 
  in the Southwest Asia and North Africa? </p>
<p>Obviously, no one can agree on any given issue despite many of the participants 
  share the same concern for their own safeties. Professor Chaudhry encouraged 
  more critical discussions on the recent events, more teach-ins and suggests 
  holding more future forums that also include Arab Americans.</p> </td>
