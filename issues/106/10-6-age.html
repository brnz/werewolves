What's in a Name?<br>
A film review of Mira nair's "The Namesake".<br><br>

by susan moua <br><br>

The film The Namesake, directed by Mira Nair, takes us into the journey of Gogol Ganguli, played by well-known Indian American actor Kal Penn. The Namesake begins with Gogol’s mother, Ashima (played by Bollywood actress Tabu), a young woman from India, who chooses to marry Ashoke Ganguli (Irfan Khan), an Indian who lives in New York, after she tries on his American shoes. After they marry and adapt to the lifestyle in New York, they bear their first son, who they have difficulty naming at the hospital. The movie follows their marriage for twenty-five years as they watch their children grow and assimilate into American culture. Throughout this two-hour film, Gogol, the oldest child, struggles back and forth with the names “Gogol,” the name his parents gave him, and “Nick,” the name he uses with others. Like many Asian Americans, he is caught between America and his homeland.<br><br>

The Namesake, adapted from the novel of the same title by Jhumpa Lahiri, is set in both present day Kolkata, India and New York City. The actors that were chosen for the roles in The Namesake seem almost perfect; there was never too much or not enough from the actors. Kal Penn does a wonderful job at portraying Gogol Ganguli, considering his disappointing roles in comedies such as Epic Movie (2007) and National Lampoon’s Van Wilder (2002). Although he plays a different role, Penn was still able to bring the character Gogol to life, displaying struggles that many of us endure when trying to define ourselves.<br><br>

Whether he is in high school or in college, Gogol somehow is unable to escape the constant laughter and questioning of his name. He rebels and dates white women even though his parents want him to marry a Bengali woman and refuses to keep in contact with his parents while in college.<br><br>

Embracing his freedom and individualism, Gogol experiences a series of events that always seems to question his identity. Although it seems to frustrate his parents that he does not acknowledge his name, it does not bother him. He is more absorbed with trying to be accepted in America than to forge ties with his parents’ homeland. It isn’t until a terrible tragedy occurs that Gogol is stirred to reflect on who exactly he is and where his priorities stand. In an evocative scene after the tragedy, we see the change within the main character when his white girlfriend calls him “Nick,” and he responds by saying, “My name is Gogol.” After this scene, we start to see the ways that Gogol opens his eyes to being a Bengal.<br><br>

The other actors, not well-known in mainstream American media, had powerful portrayals. Tabu, who plays Gogol’s mother, is perfect as the calm and beautiful Ashima. She shines on screen each time she smiles or speaks. When filmmakers try to make her look forty-five (though the film begins with Ashima at twenty-three years old), the age does not show. She still appears young and beautiful, while still portraying the maternal role well. The memorable scenes of Ashima singing magnificently at Kolkata are probably the most moving scenes in the entire movie. Kahn, who plays the father Ashoke, also portrays his character well. Ashoke’s quiet and easy demeanor might make the audience wonder how he won Ashima’s heart, yet Kahn shows his character’s unique ways of communicating with people. He plays a mediating role in the movie – though his wife hates America and his son hates his name, he eventually impacts both of their perspectives. Kahn’s bring both calmness and a sense of importance to the paternal role. These actors bring the novel to life, and their portrayals are both entertaining and credible, a rare combination.<br><br>

The cinematography of The Namesake was absolutely lovely and scenic. By shooting scenes in the slums of Kolkata, director Mira Nair brought the novel to life. Instead of focusing on the physical beauty of Kolkata, Nair focuses on the everyday life of the Bengalis, who bring the real beauty onto the screen. And although New York is overplayed on the big screen, Nair shoots from a perspective that makes the city landscape appear lonely and cold, but compelling as well. In between scenes, Nair focuses on the Howrah Bridge in Kolkata and the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, which both look very similar. This cinematic move illustrates the characters’ symbolic struggle between two worlds. When Gogol decides to travel to Kolkata, we see the Howrah Bridge in the background. This powerful scene shows how Gogol has finally accepted being Bengali.<br><br>

What is in a name? How important is it exactly when our parents decide what we should be called for the rest of our lives? The Namesake seems to stress just how important one word is in defining who one is. The film represents the experiences of the many Asian Americans seeking reassurance
about their cultural identity and self-identity. What is your name?
