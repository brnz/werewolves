<h2>race to disgrace: countdown to Asian American sellouts</h2></a>

<span class="tagline"><em>#3 Michelle Malkin</em></span>

If our “Race to Disgrace” feature was a part of the Olympic games, Michelle Malkin, neoconservative journalist, would definitely medal. As someone who was proud to be described as the “Asian Ann Coulter,” Malkin is as confused about her identity as we are about her convictions. Even though she was born to Pilipino immigrants, her beliefs on tightening immigration policies, justifying racial profiling, and doing away with affirmative action just don’t quite make sense to us at hardboiled and probably the rest of America.  Here are the top three reasons why Michelle Malkin wins (or loses) her way up our countdown:
</p><p>
3. No to Citizen-ship or plane? Michelle Malkin epitomizes a walking contradiction. Although Malkin was born to parents who came to America ON work visas, she opposes granting automatic US citizenship to babies who were born to undocumented residents, tourists, and temporary workers. It’s like she parked her car in the “Parking Lot of Opportunity” and decided to make a cement wall at the entrance so that no one else could get in once she arrived. Then again, maybe she is afraid someone else would grow up to be like her. In that case, we would be afraid too.
</p><p>
2. Healthcare for some! Malkin recently attacked a federal health insurance proposal that would provide expanded coverage for many middle and low-income families. Actually, she did more than just lash out against the policy; she made a personal attack on Graeme Frost, the 12-year-old child who suffered from brain damage after being involved in a car accident. In a weekly Democratic radio address, he credited a similar state-funded insurance program with saving his life. After his address, she took it upon herself to travel to Baltimore to do all she could to discredit and humiliate the Frosts. In her blog she writes that the 12-year-old is fair game. We don’t know where to start: the fact that she would oppose affordable health care, or the fact that she has no heart.
</p><p>
1. Malkin’s book, In Defense of Internment, argues plainly that the incarceration of Japanese Americans was justified during World War II, even though the United States had no formal grounds to incarcerate Japanese Americans. Even more so, no evidence of espionage or sabotage was ever found from the internees. How could we be down with a person who believes that US hysteria was a valid reason why 120,000 people could be legally interned? The United States should have never interned anyone…except maybe for Malkin and her ludicrous beliefs.  
</p><p>
It is one thing for Michelle Malkin to have a highly visited blog. It’s another when it’s competing with “www.michellemalkinisanidiot.com.” If she is down with being the “darkest white supremacist you’ll ever meet,” then we have no regrets with calling her what she is: a sellout.
