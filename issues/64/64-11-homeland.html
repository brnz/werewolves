    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> The INS&#8217; National 
        Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) Special Registration 
        program directly affects thousands of international students nationwide, 
        including myself, a British Pakistani. If I go under 13 units, even if 
        I have been advised by the University to do so, or change my major without 
        promptly informing the &#8216;SISS&#8217; (Services for International 
        Students and Scholars), I have been told that I WILL be asked to leave 
        the country. Indeed, this has been the case in the state of Colorado for 
        several students. Both the NSEERS and SEVIS programs were formulated belatedly 
        in the wake of the 911 attacks on New York and Washington DC.<br>
        <br>
        I remember what I felt on 911 vividly: first of all the shared sorrow 
        of my fellow human beings, in particular, my floormate who had lost her 
        cousin. It was an emotive day when people&#8217;s gazes were held low 
        and the professors ended lectures early as the feeling of the day choked 
        them up. There were wet eyes and many faces full of sympathy for those 
        who were crying.<br>
        <br>
        The second strong feeling of the day was one of fear. Who had done this? 
        Was it the Palestinians? Was it Middle Easterners? Was it people who called 
        themselves Muslims? I was fearful of the ramifications for immigrants, 
        Middle Eastern and Muslim minorities, such as myself, who would suffer 
        in the ensuing public fear and government policy. I received a multitude 
        of phone calls and emails from friends and family in England and in the 
        Bay Area advising me to keep my head low, stay away from public places 
        and to avoid any Muslim associations. The former to avoid being the target 
        of physical violence and the latter to avoid being monitored by the FBI, 
        especially since I was already a target, being a British Pakistani international 
        student. <br>
        <br>
        I didn&#8217;t quite stick to the advice of my family: I gave a speech 
        to 3000 Cal students on the night of 911, appealing to them to remain 
        a strongly accepting, integrated and tolerant community through this adversity. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It probably wasn&#8217;t my candid appeal that did the trick, but my fellow 
        students and the general atmosphere in Berkeley, with the exception of 
        two racist remarks made to me in association with the Taliban or terrorism, 
        quickly returned to normal Berkeley levels of tolerance and acceptance. 
        However, the government, did not remain so welcoming to international 
        students like myself. I heard and read more and more about what was monitored: 
        student organizations, our university email and it was even rumored that 
        some students were spies. The Patriot Act soon allowed the legal detentions 
        of immigrants without posted bail and without issued warrants. The government 
        had passed a bill that allowed and instigated the formation of an agency 
        which could legally track anyone&#8217;s internet history. I enjoyed life 
        as a student in Berkeley, but I did not enjoy an entitlement to basic 
        civil liberties and privacy. I felt like a monitored guest.<br>
        <br>
        Reinforcing this was the recent INS Special Registration program. The 
        calling in of male immigrants over the age of 16 without green cards, 
        asylum, refugee or diplomacy status but with &#8216;nationality&#8217; 
        (a deliberately ambiguous term with no legal definition) from 26 predominantly 
        Muslim nations (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Algeria, 
        Bahrain, Eritrea, Lebanon, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Qatar, Somalia, 
        Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, 
        Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan and Kuwait) to register gave solid groundings 
        to my suspicions: I WAS a target for monitoring. Since I had been sending 
        the occasional political email and since I had been reading the Guardian.co.uk 
        (a respected mainstream UK newspaper that dares posit important critical 
        questions of the US government), I already felt very insecure. <br>
        <br>
        But when one third of Iranian registries were being detained in LA, I 
        was broken down into all but a basket of nerves. After reading an interview 
        on the treatment of the detainees, the program literally consumed my thinking 
        every minute of the day. I would wake up in the middle of the night in 
        cold sweats as I feared that I may become one of the men shipped from 
        San Francisco to San Jose to Arizona, to Colorado, to LA, to San Diego, 
        given only 3 hours of sleep on cold concrete floors, using tissue paper 
        for warmth, racially abused, malnourished, accompanied by an overflowing 
        cell toilet, and deprived of the right to shower, and the right to know 
        how long I would be detained for. <br>
        <br>
        The final measure that drove me to the path I would take: news of the 
        Student Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) program, which demanded 
        the University hand the FBI all the student&#8217;s addresses, email addresses, 
        emergency contacts, grades and financial assistance information, within 
        the implementation deadline of January 31st 2003. Not only is the FBI 
        able to closely monitor international students, but the INS is able to 
        and IS detaining and deporting students for going under units (even when 
        advised to by their university, as in Colorado) or for changing their 
        major and colleges without informing their university&#8217;s International 
        Student Services. Resigned to the fact that I WAS a target for monitoring, 
        I took heed of Tahar Djoaout, the Algerian poet: </p>
      <p>&#8220;If you speak, you die <br>
        If you stay silent, you die<br>
        So speak and die.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        I had had enough of being induced into submission by my fear of what might 
        happen, or what was likely happening. I took to educating my fellow students 
        of the human and civil rights violations, both for the sake of being offended 
        at such occurrences and as a self-defense mechanism, should I be detained 
        in a similar fashion. My activism included giving interviews, writing 
        a couple of articles and hosting a rally (with the endorsement of 29 professional 
        and campus groups) of speakers to talk out on the issue. <br>
        <br>
        Fortunately for me, my first registration was uneventful. It took out 
        a day of school and I had to wait at the office for 5 hours, but those 
        were two of my major complaints. The furor the Iranian community raised, 
        with the subsequent protests and independent monitoring done outside INS 
        offices pressured INS officers from gratuitously detaining registries. 
        A Pakistani diplomat visiting the San Francisco INS office told me that 
        he was their for my support and to make sure that the officers &#8216;behaved 
        themselves&#8217;. The scariest moment was when the INS officer explained 
        that if I failed to return to the office within a year, they WOULD come 
        for me. I asked the officer to clarify what she meant by &#8216;coming 
        for me&#8217;, and she replied that it would not be a letter requesting 
        that I return to the office. <br>
        <br>
        People are becoming aware of the ineffectiveness of the registration program, 
        people are becoming aware of the human and civil rights that are being 
        violated as a result of the program and people do recognize the racist 
        nature of the program. The pressure of lobby groups is being felt by the 
        government, as the Senate debates whether to cut funding for the unpopular 
        and ineffective program. My concern is whether I am going to have trouble 
        with the INS once people&#8217;s interests in the program die down. </p>
