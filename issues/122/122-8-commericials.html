<h2>big success on a small screen</h2></a>

<p><b><i>Asian Americans Gain Visibility in TV Commericials</i></b></p>

<p>I really like commercials. When I switch on the television, I can’t help but smile as marketers try to win me over with clever lines or with fat adorable babies. I can’t stop myself from wondering what Oprah knows, that I don’t, about life inside the prison system. I’m tempted to ask my doctor about Xanafil, because it just may save my life even though I have no idea what it is. I really like commercials because they try so hard to appeal to me, and darn it, sometimes they hit a soft spot.</p>

<p>Recently however, I’ve become hardened to their pleas for my product loyalties, time investments and financial resources. Their tricks no longer impress me. Bright colors, pretty people, talking animals – I’m over it.</p>

<p>Anyway, while I doubt that my declining level of consumerism has a direct impact in the commercial market (market of commercials, not the non-governmental sector of our economy), a small part of me believes that I’m more important than I actually am, and that I’ve played a role in creating this new phenomena in the world of advertising -- Asian American people in commercials. More specifically, Asian American people without ninja costumes or heavy accents or calculators. Just plain ol’ American folks who happen to be of Asian descent. Asian Americans who shop at Home Depot, who go on dates, who are stuck in dead-end jobs… we’re a whole new generation on screen! Granted, there are still quite a few advertisements with stereotypical depictions of Asian Americans. But to see numerous ads with Asian American actors, in which the content is free from any racist implications, is truly satisfying.</p>

<p>“It’s refreshing to be represented accurately,” states Kevin Hatakeyama, an Asian American student, “any screen time we’re getting where we’re not being portrayed in a stereotypical way helps develop our real image.”</p>

<p>Some people are not as enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem like that big of a deal,” comments Janice Chan, a first-year student at Cal, “commercials are short and it just means we see an Asian person on the screen for five extra seconds. But I guess that’s better than nothing?”</p>

<p>It’s much better than nothing. While it’s hard to imagine that a screenshot of an Asian American man eating cereal in his kitchen is effectively helping to erase stereotypes, it is most definitely a significant step. Research shows that children under the age of 8 are significantly affected by the commercials they see on TV, and it plays a role in their perceptions of gender and race. These commercials featuring Asian Americans, being generally unspectacular, send a message to Asian American kids that they too are unspectacular (in a good way!) That is, that Asian Americans are Americans too.</p>

<p>As for me, these commercials make me want to whip out my wallet and start spending again. Did I mention I really do like commercials? Especially when they’re done right.</p>
