<p>South Asian music artists across the diaspora are combining their art with 
  activism by taking part in the movement for social justice around the world. 
  While much of the desi art/activism has emerged from the UK, such as the politically 
  conscious Asian Dub Foundation, the Bay Area took its place at the forefront 
  of the movement with the kick-off of the Ahimsa Music Tour in San Francisco 
  last month. The event represented both a response to hate crimes against Arabs, 
  Muslims, and South Asians as well as the rise of the &#145;Asian underground&#146; 
  scene in the Bay Area. </p>
<p>Taking its name from the Jain ethic of non-violence, the Ahimsa Tour was organized 
  to raise money for victims of the backlash against Arabs, Muslims, and South 
  Asians since September 11th.</p>
<p>As Ahimsa organizer Vijay Chattha explained, &#147;Right after the World Trade 
  Center and Pentagon attacks, it was obvious that South Asians were going to 
  be harassed...As more deaths and crimes occurred, we wanted to unite across 
  religions, countries, and regions and see what we could do to help all of the 
  victims.&#148; According to Nihal Mehta, a Bay Area DJ and organizer of the 
  Ahimsa Tour, the events seek to both &#147;raise money and raise awareness&#148; 
  of the rising backlash against Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is appropriate then that, along with uniting people across religious 
  and ethnic lines, the artists on the Ahimsa Tour are also combining different 
  musical styles in their productions. What has been termed &#145;Asian underground&#146; 
  emerged in England, where &#145;Asian&#146; refers to what we label &#145;South 
  Asian&#146;, and rose to popularity in the late-1990s. Often described with 
  clich&eacute; phrases (such as &#145;East Meets West&#146;...or is it &#145;West 
  Eats Meat&#146;?) and overused expressions, the music generally blends elements 
  of &#145;traditional&#146; South Asian music, such as tabla beats and sarangi 
  melodies, with the &#145;Western&#146; styles of hip-hop, drum and bass, dub, 
  and house music. In many ways, the sounds reflect the cultural identities of 
  the artists who are combining the &#145;Western&#146; sounds they were raised 
  on with the &#145;traditional&#146; sounds of their &#145;homeland.&#146; </p>
<p>One of the first major figures of the &#145;Asian underground&#146; &#151; 
  once it went above ground &#151; was Talvin Singh from the UK, whose rock star 
  status has earned him the disparaging nickname Talvin Klein. More recently, 
  Karsh Kale from New York has enjoyed increased airplay while heightening the 
  popularity of the &#145;Asian underground&#146; in the US.</p>
<p>Heading up the Ahimsa Tour, however, are Rhino_FX (aka Musa Ahmed), Maneesh 
  the Twister and Janaka, DJs from the Bay Area crew Dhamaal. According to the 
  DJs, Dhamaal emerged when Azaad, the West Coast&#146;s original &#145;Asian 
  underground&#146; collective founded in 1999, went into a voluntary hiatus this 
  year.</p>
<p>Janaka explains that Azaad itself &#147;started off as a random house party 
  at [his] old place in Berkeley.&#148; After a party was broken up at 1am, they 
  came up with the idea of developing Azaad as a club event in San Francisco. 
  Ahmed adds that they tried to create a space that &#147;was not a traditional 
  Bollywood/bhangra party nor a standard San Francisco club night.&#148;</p>
<p>While the meaning of &#145;dhamaal&#146; is well-debated, it loosely translates 
  to &#147;a throw down,&#148; and Dhamaal events go far beyond the music. The 
  crew is a collective of musicians and visual artists in which the DJs are only 
  one part of the entire show. As a visually stimulating, interactive, multimedia 
  experience, the shows also include live tabla players which produces &#147;a 
  full-on assault on nearly every sense,&#148; according to Janaka. While the 
  DJ summarizes Dhamaal events as &#147;the improvisational blending of electronic, 
  live acoustic, and live mixed visual images,&#148; he insists that they are 
  more than &#147;the sum of the parts.&#148;</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the Dhamaal crew is that its shows are organized 
  as benefit events for worthy causes. In connecting the unique performance style 
  with activism, Maneesh sees Dhamaal as being &#147;a part of something that 
  could give back to society and create something innovative at the same time.&#148; 
  In a sense, this reinforces the connection that the Dhamaal musicians make between 
  the community and its cultural productions. With South Asian artists as the 
  leading producers of these innovative sounds, Azaad co-founder Ahmed avoids 
  &#147;exoticizing [his] sound for the benefit of white folks.&#148; Instead, 
  the DJs use their skills to give back to their communities.</p>
<p>This outlook brought Rhino_FX, Maneesh the Twister and Janaka into the Ahimsa 
  Music Tour last month. Specifically, the tour is raising money to develop a 
  memorial to Balbir Singh Sodi, a Sikh gas station owner murdered in Mesa, Arizona; 
  to assist the family of Waquar Hasan, a slain grocery store owner from Dallas, 
  Texas; to help reconstruct the Hindu Temple that was burned down in Hamilton, 
  Ontario; and to raise money to launch the Smithsonian Sikh Heritage Project 
  in Washington, DC </p>
<p>The first show in San Francisco raised over $2500 and the tour is expected 
  to raise over $50,000 as it continues through Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, 
  Miami, New Orleans, and Chicago in the next few months. From its roots in a 
  Berkeley house party, the Dhamaal crew demonstrates the ways in which all aspects 
  of our lives can be integrated into a larger vision of social justice.</p>
