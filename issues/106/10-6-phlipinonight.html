After the War: the real world of 1948<br>
A play by Philip Gotanda sparks discussion on post WWII race relations.<br><br>

by naomi oren <br><br>

What do a Russian immigrant who is more proficient in Japanese than English, a nerdy middle-aged accountant who can’t get a date, a man who is an outcast in his own community, another man late on the rent because they won’t hire a “black man,” and a dancer trying to support her naïve younger brother all have in common?   <br><br>
A two-story wooden boarding house and a swinging affinity for some good ol’ jazz. <br><br>

Set in 1948, Philip Gotanda’s play “After the War” chronicles the lives of Japanese Americans adjusting to the move back into “Japanese Town” in San Francisco. Instead of focusing on the desolate life of Japanese Americans in internment like in productions such as “Camp Dance” and “Manzanaar,” Gotanda revives an often-overlooked chapter in Japanese American history. <br><br>

Chester Monkawa (Hiro Kanagawa), a rebellious “No-No Boy” during his camp days and a talented jazz trumpet player, has borrowed money from the sleazy Mr. Goto (Sab Shimono) in order to get back the boarding house that his parent’s once owned before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The boarding house,constructed as a three-dimensional eerily squeaky three-dimensional mobile set, is a mid-way home for many of its residents who have been bounded by political and social dilemmas effected by the policies generated during World War II. Representing refugees seeking security and understanding in their new home, the characters in After the War poignantly showcase the tensions and misunderstandings between the Japanese American community who came back to the Fillmore District to reclaim their “Japanese Town” and the African American community that moved in during their absence. Much of the tensions between these two groups were instigated by the government Redevelopment Agency. With Eminent Domain as their prime choice of weapon, the Redevelopment Agency in 1948 displaced more than 1,500 residents and over 60 small Japanese businesses to make way for “one of the first large-scale urban renewal projects in the nation (jtowntaskforce.com).” <br><br>

Before the world-premier of After the War at the American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T) in San Francisco, Nikkei Student Union (NSU) at UC Berkeley had a special reading at their annual Day of Remembrance (DOR) last February to commemorate the injustice done to the Japanese American community during WWII. Hardboiled talks to some of the members (Erin Ochi, Katie Post, Miwa Natsuki, Vanessa Hatakeyama) of NSU about what they thought about the play: <br><br>

<b>How did you come about having NSU do the readings for After the War? </b><br><br>

eo: Jere Takahashi is the faculty advisor for NSU. He is the one who first started talking about it because he worked with East Wind Books just over here (in Berkeley), and the owners
there knew Philip [Gotanda], and Jere also knew Philip so when it came time for DOR they had been talking about this and maybe trying to do a new thing with DOR... more of a fine arts oriented thing. When I heard about it I was really interested in it because I really like to incorporate the fine arts into things. From Philip we were able to get a hold of Anthony Brown, which is when we brought everything together for the show. <br><br>

<b>Is Anthony Brown the musician that played at DOR?</b> <br><br>

eo: Yep. <br><br> 

<b>He was really awesome. </b><br><br>

eo: Yeah. Anthony Brown played the music and composed the score for “After the War.” He [Brown] is half Japanese and half African-American, so the play is almost like his parents’ story because they are from San Francisco. “After the War” is a similar story with African-Americans and Japanese Americans
mixing… <br><br>

<b>Is “After the War” different from other portrayals of Japanese Americans during internment like “Camp Dance”? </b><br><br>

eo: It does. The play didn’t focus on internment solely and it was more about the effects of internment afterwards.  <br><br>

<b>Do you think there should be more plays about how people dealt with internment post-WWII? </b><br><br>

kp: If you’re in the community then you know about it. But once you step outside the community then the general public doesn’t know- even in California… <br><br>

<b>What did you think about the mobile set? </b><br><br>

mn and kp: That was really cool. <br><br>
eo: I loved it. <br><br>

<b>Did you notice the creaking noise from the mobile set?</b> <br><br>

eo: Yeah. But I think because there is so much happening... that (the noise) is understandable. <br><br>
mn: I think to avoid the creaking sound it (the mobile set) has to be so structurally sound. But for theater stuff, you really don’t have that much time. <br><br>
eo: It also made it sort of period appropriate because those older houses were creaky. <br><br>
mn: The creaking noise was kind of fun because I was trying to figure out how these doors all connected and how things were working inside. When someone was going downstairs or upstairs I could totally hear them going up or down – oh there’s a stair going down there and that’s how they’re connected! <br><br>

<b>It helped me imagine everything going inside. </b><br><br>

eo: The inner workings… <br><br>
mn: Yeah, the inner workings of the creaks.  <br><br>

<b>There’s a lot of layering of different stories. Which story did you find most appealing? </b><br><br>
kp: Well there are so many triangles… <br><br>
mn: I don’t know. Olga (Delia MacDougall) was cute. Olga and Mr. Oji (Francis Jue).  <br><br>
eo: Yeah they were cute. But it was also cool to see Earl and Marie-Louise (Carrie Paff). Just because the play was – of course – centered on the Japanese Americans. But it’s also showing what the times were like. African-Americans were still having such a hard time as well. Just to bring in those different racial tensions that were happening at the time, not just with Japanese-Americans, also helps diversify the audience. <br><br>

<b>What was your favorite moment? </b><br><br>
vh: The set rotating. The ending of the first act when everyone was dancing and everyone was happy. After that it gets sad.  <br><br>
eo: That was the point when everyone was integrated. Then the reality starts to set in. No matter what they really can’t avoid it, even if you don’t want to be a part of it... <br><br>
vh: and the women cause trouble. <br><br>
eo: (laughs) <br><br>

<b>After the War portrays a lot of racial tensions, especially between the Japanese American community and the African-American community at that time. Do similar racial tensions exist, either within those two communities or within the APA community in general? </b><br><br>

eo: I think that there are always racial tensions. I mean not everywhere and not as prevalent, but I mean there are always people who make things an issue. <br><br>
vh: There is that one part in the play where Chet explains why he quit the band in Chicago. He was like: “Well they never got me a solo, but how do you tell a black person, someone who has been stepped on his entire life, he’s stepping on you?” From everyone’s own perspective, everyone’s own life is really hard and they might not see another person’s struggle as equally valid because “ oh you don’t come from this background”. <br><br>
eo: Especially here in Berkeley, well... like Nikkei Student Union (NSU), a lot of people do tend to go off in their own racial and ethnic groups, but at the same time I don’t feel such tension. I think it’s almost it’s a way of preserving the culture and a sort of comfort. That’s always an issue in America: What is the American Culture? We’re supposed to be a melting pot of everything coming together but then again we lose so many traditions and cultures... When you get something like that, you have racial tensions. But it’s also necessary to try and segregate off a little bit to keep the culture alive. <br><br>
kp: Nowadays, there is a lot of outside social pressure. The social constraints are different. In theory political correctness and tolerance is what’s preached today, even if it’s not true that it comes out all the time. I think that because there is that standard, things are a little bit better now. <br><br>

<b>Do you think Chet would make it as a musician today? </b><br><br>

eo: I don’t see why he couldn’t. Especially in a musical crowd, where people are musicians, people are more accepted as whatever they are. <br><br>
vh: There are a lot of Asian American jazz musicians. <br><br>

<b>What did you think about the interracial relationships? </b><br><br>

vh: I almost didn’t think about that… <br><br>
eo: I think it’s weird because it was very controversial then and the play portrayed them sneaking around about it. But to us it’s not odd because like Vanessa just said we don’t really think about it. <br><br>

<b>Was there anything that you didn’t like about the play? </b><br><br>

kp: The fact that the entire thing took place at the boarding house made it seem chaotic because it was all confined to that set. <br><br>
vh: Like the Real World. <br><br>
eo: I think that that was also a part of the times because they didn’t really have that many places to go to. <br><br>
vh: It was Real World- Japantown. Only that it was middle-aged people instead of young people.
Anything else? <br><br>
vh: For young adults to the older age groups, it’s a really good play, but you might want to read the program because it has a lot of historical information that you need to understand the play. <br><br>
mn: I didn’t know about Redevelopment and all the other stuff. <br><br>
eo: It’s not a play to go into if you want to learn about Redevelopment is and what internment was. Probably they (the audience) would just get the love triangle thing and the racial tensions but they wouldn’t really know why they were there and what’s the issue behind the boarding house and having African-Americans in there.
As revealed in hardboiled’s discussion with NSU, “After the War” is a vivid interpretation of Japanese Americans in the post-war Fillmore district coping with problems of racial integration, recuperation of property, and simply trying to define their American identity. Philip Gotanda’s play reflects these hardships – not as a cheesy melodrama – but through the reality of human struggle. <br><br>

Thanks to NSU for the interview. <br><br>
