<p>For over a century, immigrants and Americans of Asian descent have pondered 
  over issues of identity and its signification. The evolution of the latest politically-correct 
  label from Asian to Asian Pacific Islander American reveals a certain understanding 
  about life in the United States of America: we have to stick together, especially 
  if we comprise only 3% of the national population. </p>
<p>Yet sticking together remains an enigma. We realize that we have to band together 
  under a single banner, but we have not yet fleshed out what this coalescing 
  would look like. In creating a collective identity, many questions arise: what 
  does it mean to be APIA? What are the necessary characteristics to be considered 
  APIA? Which groups and ethnicities are included (and thus, excluded)? Who draws 
  the line of inclusion and exclusion? The basic question is: who is this &#147;we&#148;?</p>

<p>Most people look to Asia to answer this question. We take this label for granted, 
  using it everyday in a variety of contexts&#151;Asian Ghetto Food Court, where 
  most of us get boba; the Asian Studies Department, in which what you study is 
  determined by others&#146; definition of Asia; the food aisle in Safeway named 
  &#147;Asian foods&#148; that just cannot do justice its title; that mysterious 
  bottle labeled Asian spices that most of us have somewhere in the kitchen. Most 
  people take Asian to mean those from Asia; or descendants of those from Asia. 
  But this label, created by European nations during their predatory penetration 
  into an area east of themselves, is problematic. Asia is heterogeneous, diffuse, 
  and diverse. India and Japan have few similarities. The Philippines itself comprises 
  thousands of islands (the area designated as the Southern Islands includes a 
  total of 7,000 islands). And to complicate things further, Australia and New 
  Zealand claim to be Asian; because of geography. The concept Asia is contested 
  internationally. It is no surprise that the concept of Asian/Asian Pacific Islander 
  American is contested domestically.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this predicament more conspicuous and more invisible than on the 
  Berkeley campus. Conspicuous because no consensus exists among students regarding 
  what Asian Pacific Islander American signifies. Invisible because hardly any 
  students discuss the issue. Asian/Asian-American/Pacific Islander students constituted 
  41.7% of the undergraduate population in Fall 2000. The University defined the 
  category of &#147;Asian/Asian-American/Pacific Islander&#148; as &#147;Chinese/Chinese-American,&#148; 
  &#147;East Indian/Pakistani,&#148; &#147;Japanese/Japanese-American,&#148; &#147;Korean/Korean-American,&#148; 
  &#147;Pilipino/Pilipino-American,&#148; &#147;Pacific Islander,&#148; &#147;Vietnamese/Vietnamese-American,&#148; 
  and &#147;Other Asian.&#148; Who is missing from this picture, subsumed in a 
  non-category labeled Other Asian? Those of mixed ancestry, Singaporeans, Malays, 
  Hmong, Burmese, Laotian, Cambodian, Indonesian, East Timorese, Thai, and many 
  more. Asians are definitely conspicuous on campus but we remain silent in the 
  larger student population, and even within our own. Why? Because the population 
  has fragmented into ethnic specific groups: Chinese Student Association, Indus, 
  Tomodachi, Laotian American Student Representatives, and Singapore Malaysia 
  Student Association, to name a few. Even student organizations that claim to 
  be Asian American actually have a preponderance of one group&#151;Chinese American. 
  This Chinese American dominance is no surprise, since &#147;Chinese/Chinese-Americans&#148; 
  comprised about 50% of all Asian/Asian-American/Pacific Islander students in 
  Fall 2000, and 20.8% of the total undergraduate population. But what is surprising 
  is that the third largest subgroup, &#147;East Indian/Pakistani&#148; is extremely 
  underrepresented in most pan-Asian organizations and events. South Asians actually 
  fought legally to be recognized as Asians, and yet they remain in the periphery. 
  The danger of claiming pan-Asianness yet having a prevalence of just one ethnic 
  group, is that other groups within that pan-Asian identity may feel marginalized. 
  And they may found their own ethnic specific student organizations for comfort 
  or a sense of belonging. The Berkeley campus houses over 60 Asian registered 
  student organizations. This is not a problem. A great flourishing of Asian ethnic-specific 
  clubs attests to the immense diversity and cultural richness of the region we 
  call Asia.</p>
<p>Yet a problem arises when these 60+ student groups do not communicate among 
  themselves, do not dialogue, do not associate with each other. In this situation, 
  ethnocentrism becomes easier to swallow. And the current situation trumps the 
  idea of a pan-Asian identity that we need in order for our social and political 
  voices to be heard and recognized as legitimate. We will not be heard if we 
  fragment into 60+ different voices on this campus, or anywhere else for that 
  matter. This is not to say that our individual voices are invalid or unimportant. 
  But we also need a cohesive and powerful voice to demand justice and protection 
  for our larger community/communities. Such a voice did not exist when Vincent 
  Chin was killed for looking Japanese. Years later, Joseph Ileto was also killed 
  for looking Asian; And following the September 11th attack, South Asians are 
  being targeted in racial hate crimes. All these lives extinguished because of 
  racism against Asians. Against us. </p>
<p>Perhaps on the Berkeley campus, the slow trend to ethnic-specific tunnel vision 
  has taken a strong hold. Perhaps we have only been listening to voices within 
  our ethnic community, and drowning out other voices from other Asian ethnic 
  groups. It is true that we all do not have the same voice. We are not all alike. 
  But difference and solidarity are not mutually exclusive. We can support the 
  Filipino American community in their fight for a tenured (FTE?) Pilipino American 
  professor in the Ethnic Studies department. We can lend voices of support to 
  the South Asian students, who have been under scrutiny following the events 
  of September 11th. Basically, we can care for ourselves and our other APIA communities 
  as well. But perhaps we have become too comfortable as Chinese Americans, Japanese 
  Americans, Korean Americans, Filipino Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and etc. 
  to realize that we also have a stake in being Asian Pacific Islander Americans; 
  that when we leave Berkeley, we will not be 41.7% of the general population; 
  that mainstream America still sees us all as Asians; that others will ask us 
  if we can speak English because of our appearance; that an education and a successful 
  career will not shield us from the sundry manifestations of racism. Some things 
  haven&#146; t changed. And they never will unless we act. Frederick Douglass 
  once said: &#147;If there is no struggle, there is no progress.&#148; Where 
  is the struggle on this campus? And can we honestly expect progress?<br>
