<h3><a href="/online/delusion.html">Dalai Lama Delusion</a> by lina peng <span class="isdate">march 2008</span></h3>
<p>
Anyone who follows the news (myself included) has recently been bombarded with minute by minute updates of the situation in Tibet. A quick summary of events thus far: On March 10th, some Buddhist monks demonstrated in Lhasa (the capital of Tibet). This has sparked off ongoing anti-Chinese rioting in Lhasa and surrounding provinces by ethnic Tibetans. So far, some 20 people have been killed and many more injured. Unkind words have been said by both sides with the Chinese accusing of the Dalai Lama of trying to ruin the Olympic Games, the Dalai Lama saying "cultural genocide" has occurred. And as always, the West tip toes haphazardly in between.

<h3><a href="/online/mayday.html">Mayday May Day???</a> by jason coe <span class="isdate">may 2007</span></h3>
<p>
Begrudgingly, I awoke this morning to attend a “mandatory” 9 AM class because the instructor had written me an email specifically asking me to attend. My attendance record is substandard at best. While walking along the empty streets of Telegraph Avenue, I was well aware that today was International Workers’ Day and the anniversary of the Great American Boycott of 2006, but my main objective was to get my name on the class sign-in sheet and then promptly zone out. From the estimates I’d read in most major newspapers, I was doubtful that this year’s protests would bring out millions, shut down major freeways and make the voices of 12 million undocumented immigrants and their allies heard around the world like the protests of 2006.
