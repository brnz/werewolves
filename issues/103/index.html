<h2>editor's note</h2>
 <p>The November 24th column by Kenneth Eng in AsianWeek titled &ldquo;Proof That Whites Inherently Hate Us&rdquo; gives a list of alleged evidence that &ldquo;White people hate us and will always hate us&rdquo;. Unfortunately Kenny, it isn&rsquo;t that the White people hate the Asians, it&rsquo;s that the Asians don&rsquo;t give a damn about themselves.</p>

      <p>Yes, I am angry too. Where was the media frenzy and public outcry of the Michael Richards magnitude when countless racist comments were made by public figures about Asian Americans? Where were the loud lawyers and protests in the 2004 election when Asians Americans were turned away from the polls and denied translated materials? But perhaps the most important question is: where are all the other angry Asian Americans?</p>
      <p>If there is anything that comes close to absolute truth in the United States, it is that nothing is free. Equality, justice and dignity are not just dolled out: they have to be fought for. When you are not fighting, you are losing. No one will, or can do it, but us.</p>
      <p>And Asians Americans seem to be on the perpetual cusp of almost winning. A recent UCLA article named Asian Americans as the new &ldquo;sleeping giants&rdquo; in California politics because of their rapidly growing number of eligible voters. Actually, researchers have been making the same observation for over ten years. And still, the giants sleep on. As scholar Wendy K. Tam wrote poignantly in 1995, &ldquo;The numbers are there. Apathy is now their last and greatest barrier&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>A great big sincere thank you to everyone at hardboiled for another unforgettable semester, all of you are truly amazing. Have yourselves a wonderful holiday season full of twinkling lights, warm-fuzzy feelings, love and kindness.</p>
