<p>You may not have put much thought into the role airport security screeners 
  play in ensuring the safety of thousands of airline passengers each day. You 
  may not notice the airport security screeners who go about their jobs seriously 
  and diligently, enduring poor working conditions and low wages. That is, until 
  recently, as eyes of suspicion and scrutiny have fallen on airport workers in 
  the wake of the post-September 11 hysteria. With the passing of the Aviation 
  and Transportation Security Act, signed by President Bush last November, all 
  security screeners are required to be US citizens, threatening the jobs of hundreds 
  of documented immigrants, the majority of whom are Pilipino. </p>
<p>On February 19th, 2002, there were massive demonstrations at all of the three 
  major airports in the Bay Area; San Francisco International, Oakland International, 
  and the San Jose airport, in support of the airport screeners(many of whom are 
  Pilipino and non-citizens&#151; the latest targets and victims of the September 
  11 terrorist attacks) Pilipinos make up 80% of the screeners at San Francisco 
  International Airport, 60% of the screeners at Oakland International, and 80% 
  of the screeners in the San Jose Airport. Many activists believe the law unfairly 
  attributes blame to airport screeners and underhandedly scapegoats immigrants.</p>
<p>The law to federalize airport screeners will heavily impact the immigrant-majority 
  Pilipino American community. As immigrants must live in the US for five years 
  before applying for citizenship, many workers are still ineligible or are currently 
  in the application process.</p>
<p>Many workers who previously held positions as engineers, government officials 
  and medical personnel in the Philippines now find themselves working below their 
  educational background and experience due to limited opportunities for immigrants. 
  To recent immigrants, working at the airports serves as a means of providing 
  for their families and seeking financial stability.</p>
<p>For years, airport screeners have endured low pay and have only recently acquired 
  more decent wages, increasing from $6.25 to $13 at SFO and from $6 to $11.25 
  at Oakland Airport, through the passage of a living wage ordinance. But even 
  for Pilipino screeners with jobs not directly threatened by the new citizenship 
  requirement, unfavorable working conditions of low wages with minimal benefits 
  still remain, especially due to a rising sense of mistrust and skepticism toward 
  immigrants and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The new citizenship requirement will punish many hard-working, tax-paying legal 
  immigrants who have dedicated years of experience to the safety of millions 
  of airline passengers and may pose a greater threat to public safety by replacing 
  them with less experienced workers. Besides security screeners, non-citizens 
  work as flight attendants, pilots, mechanics, baggage handlers, plane fuelers, 
  cargo loaders and other workers that have direct access to aircraft. Even the 
  National Guard, who now patrols airport terminals armed with rifles in full 
  view, does not require US citizenship. Considering that there are over 50,000 
  non-citizens within the Armed Forces, the US government does not hesitate to 
  sacrifice immigrants in its defense but questions the loyalty and national origins 
  of its airport security.</p>
<p>The struggle of Pilipino airport security screeners opens up a persistent wound 
  caused by the legacy of 100 years of US imperialist relations with the Philippines. 
  During the early part of this century, the US capitalized upon Pilipinos to 
  work as farm laborers in California and Hawaii and as cannery workers in Alaska. 
  In addition, Pilipinos fought in Asia in WWII and during the Vietnam War and 
  have only recently begun to get the proper recognition for their service to 
  the US. Even today, the US has repositioned itself militarily in the Philippines, 
  with no regard for the Constitution of the Philippines. </p>
<p>Does the U.S. ever stop?!! The stealing and raping of Native American land, 
  enslaving Africans, reaping the profits from the blood and sweat of communities 
  of color! Excluding the Chinese from migrating to this country in 1882, after 
  letting them break their backs by clearing out what the West once thought as 
  non-arable land! Having Pilipinos work up and down the agricultural coast of 
  California, denying Pilipino WWII vets their benefits after Pilipinos fought 
  for the U.S. side, while putting innocent people of Japanese descent into concentration 
  camps?! Does it ever stop?! Will it? It continues to this day&#151;the attacks 
  on people of color, immigrants, the youth, the poor&#151;nothing changes but 
  the number on that proposition and the white face behind that fake smile.</p>
<p>According Kawal Ulanday, a community organizer with Filipinos for Affirmative 
  Action(FAA), &#147;the government just wants to give the public a false sense 
  of security by replacing the immigrant screeners with more American-looking 
  security workers.&#148; Improved security lies in better airport policies and 
  regulations, quality supervision, and decent wages to minimize the turnover 
  and displacement of experienced workers. Requiring US citizenship of airport 
  security screeners will not ensure greater safety, and questioning the loyalty 
  of immigrants is a form of racial profiling and discrimination. For now, groups 
  like FAA are pushing for legislation that would help security screeners keep 
  their jobs, but ultimately seek to repeal the citizenship requirement.</p>
<p>Active resistance by community organizations/ groups such as the Filipino Coalition 
  for Global Justice, Not War; Filipinos for Affirmative Action; the Philip Vera 
  Cruz Justice Project; Bayanihan Resource Center along with the Service Employees 
  International Union and other labor and immigrant rights groups have a campaign 
  working collaboratively on three levels. It involves working on the repeal and 
  amendment for safeguarding jobs; organizing workers themselves so they know 
  their rights, and developing leadership; participate in community and public 
  education.</p>
<p>This struggle needs our help in protecting the rights of our Pilipino brothers 
  and sisters, many of whom are our aunties, uncles, relatives! Help out by giving 
  educationals, gathering signatures for petitions, engaging in community education, 
  lobbying and changing the laws, outreaching, letter writing, or simply making 
  a banner and showing support at an action; there are many ways that we can contribute 
  to the struggle! And the next time you&#146;re at the airport, consider the 
  untold stories and, now, the uncertain futures of these security screeners, 
  and acknowledge them with a bit more patience and respect.</p>
