hardboiled Time Machine<br>
Ten years of deep shit and stickin' it to 'em. <br><br>

by pauline sze <br><br>

<font size=4>As <b>hardboiled </b>finishes off its last issue in its tenth year of publication, we remember that ten years ago three passionate students formed this newsmagazine in response to the political tensions stemming from Proposition 209 and the lack of representation of Asian American issues in a fresh and critical manner. In an effort to commemorate our ten years of service to the community, we felt it would be refreshing to hear the voices of some of the past editors of hardboiled. In the words of one of the original founders, Cuong Lam, “Wow, has it been ten years? ... Amazing.”</font> <br><br>

<b>How did you get involved with hardboiled newsmagazine (or if you were a founder, why did you decide to start hardboiled)?</b> <br><br>

EW: hardboiled started as an offshoot of Asian Student Union, a progressive APA political student-organizing group. Three of us (me, Cuong Lam, and Jean Hsu) got the idea during finals in our junior year (1997). At that time, most of our work was around education and organizing, specifically against the Regent’s decision to end affirmative action and Prop 209. We were so sick of the negative coverage of affirmative action at the Daily Cal that we decided to create an alternative API voice. We also hated how boring or tacky the existing API magazines were at that time on and off campus (A Mag, Yolk, Slant) so we figured, we certainly couldn’t do any worse. <br><br>
DKS: I started Cal with dreams of Computer Science. Two years and 1,000 lab hours later, I didn’t make the cut and suddenly had a lot of free time on my hands. That and my then-youthful idealism to fight the Man and encourage fellow Asian Americans to do the same. <br><br>
JH: I found a dirty, crumpled copy of an issue on the floor of my ex-boyfriend’s apartment. It was the one with Mao saying, “Give us your labor” and Chiang Kai-Shek saying, “Give us your money.” I don’t remember any of the articles but I liked the layout. Then I went to a meeting and they made me join their cult. <br><br>
DM: I was actually on my way to join The Heuristic Squelch that second year of college. And one Tarak Shah sent me a kind email, having heard of me from a friend. Curious to have been so elicited, I stopped by one day at the meeting. I was impressed by how good looking everyone was. I mean passionate. It was a well-run organization with a lot of fire and openness. I was immediately drawn to the knee-in-the groin muckraking spirit. It was a heady (and stylish) mix of irreverence, indignation, and wit. Many years later, I found out the staff of The Heuristic Squelch was not nearly as good looking, so I’m glad it all worked out. <br><br>
KC: As a pissed off freshman, all it took was a fateful stroll along Sproul. Equally pissed off looking people sitting at the table proved far too enticing to pass up. Went to a meeting. End of story. <br><br>

<b>Describe one of the most rewarding experiences you had with hardboiled. </b><br><br>

CL: The most rewarding thing about hardboiled was the response during its first year from faculty, students and leaders at Cal. I remember being in Professor Michael Omi’s class when he cited hardboiled, getting emails from students, and having people thanking us on the steps of Sproul for creating hardboiled. <br><br>
DCY: It was all about staying up all night, talking smack, and drinking like dumb crazy people. Another thing is that when the first website went up (in year two), we started getting crazy hits from all over the place, especially after Yahoo featured us. Some of the correspondence we got was pretty cool. <br><br>
AC: Very often, I would meet Asian American students at other colleges around the country who knew about hardboiled, read it on-line, and always said that they wished they had something like it at their campuses. Also, in the last issue of series five, we did a feature on well-known Asian American ‘sell outs’ (e.g. Dinesh D’Souza, Elaine Chao -- Bush’s Secretary of Labor). A Political Science professor used that piece for the final exam in his class that year. <br>
<i>Editor’s Note:</i> Prof Zook used hardboiled in his final exam. <br><br>
JH: We used to go over to the Layout Editor’s (Harish) apartment on Channing and stay there all night [for production night(s)]. Those were the most fun. A lot of people use to hate on hardboiled, too -- is it still like that? We used to get all kinds of hate mail. I enjoyed replying to those as well. There was an article we published about interracial dating on the Berkeley campus and a guy wrote in about how we’re a bunch of racists. Good times. Oh, and we had a couple “hardboiled-sponsored” events in 2002 that were cool. We had the Sweatshop Fashion Show on Lower Sproul, and we held a spoken word night with Ishle Park, Dennis Kim, and Beau Sia. <br><br>
LWM: We got all the APA campus groups to hate us and got busted by the Daily Cal for plagiarism - in just one issue! Also, we once talked about doing this “Women of hardboiled” spread to rival the “Men of The Patriot,” where D, Vilar, Marites, G-lo and I would stand on some steps near the Campanile in our suits and shit. But we never did it. We also talked about doing an undercover investigation of pledging an APA frat. We also never did that. Both of those would probably have been very rewarding experiences. <br><br>
AH: The coolest part of being in hardboiled is getting out into the community and talking to people. I got to meet people who have played a huge part in shaping Asian American history and contemporary politics, such as activist Yuri Kochiyama, protestors from the ‘99 Ethnic Studies strikes, senior citizens who still remember the I-Hotel evictions, SF School Board member Jane Kim, and more. Meeting these people put human faces on the issues that affect our community. <br><br>

<b>Describe one of the most challenging experiences you had with hardboiled.</b> <br><br>

CL: Leaving the publication we created and passing it to the next staff. It belonged to the students of Cal...
MA: The challenges of last-minute scrambling to get content and layout together, especially for the first issue, when hardboiled was just five or so people.<br><br>
LWM: A girl from the Asian Political Association almost attacked me in front of Wheeler. To diffuse the situation, I walked away. She screamed at me, “Don’t walk away! Come back here!” Thank god Peter Gee hid behind the bushes around the corner, in case something went down. She goes to Boalt now, I hope she reads this.<br><br>
DL: Working until late into the night and driving it to the printers. The reward sometimes was Krispy Kreme though.<br><br>
ME: Issue 6.2 stands out as particularly trying. We dealt with a plagiarized story and flak about a piece on APA campus organizations. There was some damage that needed controlling. <br><br>
DM: I struggled with the “us-versus-them” tone that pervades the paper. Perhaps there’s something deeper to that, something that is a larger struggle for identity politics. But I also think X was an amazing project to push cross talk and coalition. So rather than a specific event, it was this ongoing struggle for all of us to ride our passions for the issues, but to also not let anger or the easy route obscure the issues, or quality work. Injustice and foolishness can often speak for themselves, when you give it the forum. <br><br>

<b>What do you value the most about hardboiled? </b><br><br>

EW: I don’t know…builder’s pride? When we started it, we knew that all of the founders would be gone after the first year. So my goal from the start was to groom leadership to keep it from dying after we left. So besides editing articles, I was most interested in building the teams and camaraderie to keep it going. To see it at ten years--wow! On a personal level, the friendships I made or solidified have continued to this day. Three of my four grooms people at my wedding were either editors or writers for the first issue. <br><br>
DKS: The camaraderie and commitment. The attitude. The danger. The drugs and the fast cars.<br><br>
AC: That folks have kept it going for ten years! When hardboiled first came out, the current first-year students were in third grade! <br><br>
DM: It was an opportunity as a student to really empower myself to learn from my peers and the stories about issues of social justice. I mean at 19, did I really understand what was going on? It was very rough. hardboiled allows a bunch of passionate kids, who know sometimes shit is fucked up, to grapple with some of those things and develop a sophistication regarding that. It allowed us to talk to each other and the larger community of Asian American activism. Rather than just being told by a teacher, we sought the teachers out themselves, and then in turn tried to share that in print. It has been very influential in figuring out the fight I want to fight. <br><br>
JC: Nothing is more valuable than hardboiled’s staying power. The fact that it has been around for ten years now is a testament to the passion of the Asian American community. hardboiled’s existence makes liars out of people who say that Asian Americans are apathetic and socially unconscious. <br><br>

<b>How has hardboiled changed since the days you were an editor? </b><br><br>

EW: After I graduated it became more tart and dogmatic. Yeah, we had a political bent, but our goal was to put really solid articles that were interesting. No bullshit clichés, no predictable screeds--we wanted to inform without being didactic. More Daily Show than Harpers. <br><br>
DCY: What I’ve seen of hb since I graduated is that it has remained more like series two than series one. I can tell you how it changed between the first and second years. I love the editors from the first year, but I thought they were overly conservative—not in the political sense but they tried so hard to adopt a serious tone and imagery, akin to NPR or the N.Y. Times. I used to argue with them—“We’re called HARDBOILED, damn it, I think it’s okay to have some attitude.” Anyway, after they graduated we riff-raff went to town on the thing and gave it some spunk and I started liking hb a lot more as a publication. I hate it when Asian American publications a staid and overly understated aesthetic, like skinny serif fonts, pictures of bamboos, tasteful small graphics in boxes, crap like that. <br><br>
LWM: I’ve actually talked about this recently - hardboiled is actually a social group now! It’s very disconcerting. It used to be so uncool it was cool to be with hardboiled, and now there’s a facebook group and shit. I always thought our unofficial motto was: “hardboiled – we don’t need you.” But I guess we do. And we’re better for it. <br><br>

<b>So…what’s up with that obligatory diss against the Daily Cal on our website?</b> <br><br>

DCY: I wrote that. Actually, I wrote that blurb when I made the first hb website back in like 1998. It brought a tear to my eye when I realized it was still up. I don’t know how the Daily Cal is now but it was a big piece of crap back in my day. I think we perceived it as an organ of the right wing, as its editorials were generally conservative. Prop. 209 was passed back when I was still in college and the Daily Cal barely took a stand (and might have even celebrated it, though I don’t recall exactly). The Asian Americans who wrote for it often espoused assimilationist points of view; for example, columns about how “I can’t stand how people stereotype Asians, in fact, I suck at math, so I’m not one of those nerdy Asians! I’m cool!” It was like, fuck you guys, stand up for yourselves and the community, you don’t need to make any excuses. They were also running a lot of ads for “Asian Dreamgirls” calendars and other fetishist shit like that. We once ran a stupid spoof ad for “Caucasian Dreamgirls” and actually got some interest! <br><br>
MC: Well, I also wrote for the Daily Cal but quit soon after I joined hb! <br><br>
AC: It sucks. <br><br>
JH: I didn’t know anyone who read the Daily Cal, except to do the crossword puzzle. <br><br>
LWM: Wow - if you have to ask... In brief: it fucking sucks. <br><br>
ME: Umm, it’s the Daily Cal. <br><br>
JC: They do what they do, and hardboiled does what it does. Compare the two, and that is a diss in itself. <br><br>

<b>What are you up to these days? </b><br><br>

CL: I am currently in New York City working for MTV Networks in Times Square. <br><br>
DCY: I’m now an attorney at a firm in LA, doing commercial and intellectual property litigation. After college I worked for the tech sector for a couple of years in the Bay Area and Germany but found it unfulfilling, and I missed being in school. So I applied to Boalt Hall to basically relive my youth. Law is much more fun than engineering. <br><br>
MC: I am a staff writer at the Oakland Tribune and also editor for Hyphen magazine - but nowadays I’m mostly just hanging out at home with my baby boy. <br><br>
ML: Currently, I’m in a PhD program in Human Development & Family Studies at Pennsylvania State University. My research interests are generally in API delinquency and substance use, and the role of culture and immigration in youth development. I’ll always be interested in youth activism and community development. <br><br>
DKS: My main project is an epic 1,500+ page sequel to _Journey to the West_; I’m working on it from a fortified compound in the Mojave, near Lancaster. I’m a motivational speaker for high school students on the side. I also play bass for Monolidic, a struggling Asian American band that will no doubt become a sonically destructive force of nature in indie rock as soon as we find a non-flaky drummer. And practice. Regularly.
HH: After graduating from Berkeley I started writing for magazines and newspapers, and went to graduate school in the History of American Civilization at Harvard. I’ll be starting as a professor in the English Department at Vassar College in the Fall. <br><br>
LWM: I’m a freelance writer and an editor at AsianWeek newspaper and Hyphen magazine. I know, I know. <br><br>
DL: Got an M.A. in Chinese history at Columbia. Going to law school at Tulane and doing some work with the Vietnamese community here in New Orleans. <br><br>
ME: Getting my ass kicked as a PhD student in the English Department at UWashington. <br><br>
DM: I’m a first year med student in the Joint Medical Program between Berkeley’s School of Public Health and UCSF School of Medicine. As part of that, I’m also in a program called PRIME-US that focuses on health issues related to the urban underserved. Some of the issues there include understanding the role of community clinics; barriers in access for immigrants, whether economic, language, legal, or cultural; prison health care; racial disparities; and homelessness. It’s been a really incredible opportunity to pursue my passions for social justice, hands on work, and scholarly/scientific thinking. I am focusing my master’s research on trying to understand whether disparities in health status along racial lines constitutes a deprivation of civil rights, and what the role of the government would then be. I’m excited about becoming a doctor, and using that in this kind of work, but I’m not sure about all the details yet. And I hope to keep writing in many ways. <br><br>

<b>Are you still active in the Asian American community? </b><br><br>

MC: I write and edit for Hyphen magazine - also an all-volunteer pub. Prior to going on maternity leave, I covered API issues for the Oakland Tribune as a part of my beat. I also support and am a member of various API orgs, like the Center for Asian American Media. <br><br>
MA: I write for a Vietnamese-English bilingual magazine, BN. <br><br>
ML: I’m trying to be involved with the API community here at Penn State but let’s just say things are kinda different here. I went to their APA Caucus meeting the other day with the undergrads and I really had to hold myself back from taking over the meeting. They have an Asian American Studies class that they’re campaigning to make permanent so I’m sure I’ll be involved in that. I’d like to help teach a course or facilitate something. Next year, I might consider reaching out to the API community orgs in Philly and DC. <br><br>
DKS: After school, I put a couple of years in the trenches as a grant writer for a Korean American non-profit. I also got involved for a time with a local Asian American writers group and then went to UCLA for an MA in Asian American Studies, which I finally finished this year. Right now most of my support is just the moral kind for the Asian American community/arts scene. <br><br>

<b>Do you still read hardboiled? </b><br><br>

CL: I don’t. I had to let it grow… <br><br>
DCY: I couldn’t bear to read hb the year after I graduated. Even though I loved the people who became editors after me, I considered hb my baby—I loved hb and it pretty much defined college for me—so it was too painful for me to see it in other people’s hands, so I tried to pretend it didn’t exist. After that, I was getting email updates and getting sent issues for a while, but it stopped. I read the website from time to time.
LWM: No – but I want to! Why don’t you guys have an RSS feed? And non-PDF articles? <br><br>
DL: Once a year, on the website. Heheh. <br><br>
AH: Yeah, but I have only been able to read the online editions. I yearn for the newsprint pages. <br><br>
JC: Sometimes I read it online, and when I do, it makes me feel young and nostalgic, albeit I have only been a graduate for less than a year. <br><br>

<b>And, just for kicks…if you could be any type of cereal, what would it be and why? </b><br><br>

EW: The cereal at the dining commons, because you’re always going to be better than the food they cooked. <br><br>
DCY: Fuck cereal, I would be some sort of Taiwanese breakfast meat bun. <br><br>
MA: Granola…because I’m nutty. <br><br>
DKS: Rice, the finest cereal crop of them all. <br><br>
DL: Cheerios, because I would float. I cannot swim, not even in milk. <br><br>
ME: Grapenuts. No one would eat me, and if they tried I’d break their teeth. <br><br>
