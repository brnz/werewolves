<h2>Breaking Through</h2>
by cher padua

<p><b><i>Can Asian music artists capture the American public?</i></b></p>

<p>Back in the Philippines in elementary school, I was already aware that familiarity with Western pop culture carried a level of bragging rights with my peers. While we admired the successes of our own native actors and musicians, it was much cooler to idolize American artists. This is why many popular Asian entertainers feel they must also gain fame in the United States in order to be truly successful.

 

</p>
<p>To many in Asia, America is the land of milk and honey. This vision rings true for members of the public just trying to get by, as well as for glamorized celebrities. South Korean girl group the Wonder Girls has taken the leap in the hopes that they will be welcomed here. Still, they have little going for them.  The days when girl groups were famous in America are long gone. Beyonce is now a solo artist and who knows what happened to the Pussycat Dolls. The Wonder Girls have missed the train by a few years with no indication of when, if ever, it’s coming back. The list of Asian entertainers wanting to make it big in the U.S. goes on. Names like Utada Hikaru and Se7en come to mind, artists who can’t seem to break the American entertainment industry, finding popularity only amongst the Asian and Asian American community.

 

</p>
<p>In contrast, American entertainers such as the Backstreet Boys experience a more positive reception from Asian countries regardless of their popularity in their home country. Miles and miles of girls holding placards proclaiming their love for these entertainers whom they know little to nothing about are willing to stay on their feet for hours, as they mouth the words to songs in a language they probably barely understand. Once artists, musicians or actors hit it big in the United States, their chances of being well-known, even loved, in Asia are quite high, quite unlike the fate their Asian counterparts face in America. 

 

</p>
<p>It is interesting to note however, that this unlucky streak for Asians seems to occur only in the music industry. There are Asians and Asian Americans who have been influential in the Western pop culture from acting to filmmaking. Take for example Yunjin Kim, a Korean actress who is part of the ensemble for ABC’s “Lost.” In the hit television series, she plays a Korean woman who on some occasions even speaks fluently in her native language. Most notably, Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki has gained prominence and critical acclaim in the American entertainment industry for his animated films like “Howl’s Moving Castle”; he has also won the prestigious Oscar award for Best Animated Feature for “Spirited Away.”

 

</p>
<p>That being said, it is in the music industry that they still find it particularly hard to establish their niche amongst Western audiences. This may be because the music industry and its audience are fickle. The market bosses cater to artists who are easily marketable or are predicted to be the next big thing; when this venture fails, those artists are quickly dropped. Imports do not have the avenues that new American pop stars such as Taylor Swift had in “American Idol” or Miley Cyrus had in the Disney Channel, and therefore rely on their label’s promotion and word of mouth, strategies with no certainty for success.

 

</p>
<p>Nevertheless, racial bias still plays a major role in the lack of success of Asian Americans and imports from the East. These artists face an uphill battle in breaking through the forces of xenophobia suffered by the entertainment industry today. When Asians mispronounce an English word, it’s embarrassing. However, when Americans mispronounce a Japanese word, or mess up a phrase in Mandarin, it’s cute and endearing. It is necessary for Asian entertainers to adopt the American way in order for them to even be considered in the industry; even then, there is no guarantee of being successful merely because they look “different.” The Wonder Girls are criticized for their accents while Utada, an American-born Japanese singer/songwriter, found little success in the U.S. despite her fluency and accuracy with the English language and her incredible musical talents. 

 

</p>
<p>This is indicative of the huge disparity between the reception Asian or Asian American performers experience in the U.S. and that which American performers, no matter how outdated they are, receive in Asian countries. This double standard and inconsistency trickle all the way down to the most ordinary exchange in our day-to-day lives. What people see in their pop idols, they emulate in their daily interactions. This is how an ordinary person may start to feel the dire need to Americanize themselves, or get the idea that it’s not okay to be proud of one’s heritage.

 
</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of any particular race. It is a mere illustration of the racial bias going on in the world today. The glorification of all things American while other cultures are left in the backburner is as true and as insulting now as it was when I was 10. It is quite problematic that in the 21st century, the world is still suffering from racial bias that affects people from all walks of life, ranging from the wealthy and the famous to ordinary folks living ordinary lives.</p>
