<h2>my china is grey</h2></a>
by jasmine wang

<p><b><i>Countries are not black or white, red or blue, but only shades of grey</i></b></p>

<p>Sixty years ago on October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the beginning of the People’s Republic of China with the words, China “has stood up.” Though hindsight shows us that the coming decades would be filled with uncertainty, intense struggle and cruelty, these words were nevertheless appropriate for the time.</p>

<p>The birth of Communist China was an undeniable step away from the violated, impoverished and war-torn China that defined the preceding century. I specifically use the term “violated” because it is what best describes the British empire’s smuggling of opium into China during the 18th century, an action which incapacitated millions and led to the Opium Wars, the cession of Hong Kong, and the desecration of the Summer Palace in 1860.</p>

<p>This theme of foreign violation continued into the 20th century and culminated in the invasion of the Japanese during World War II and the massacre that was the Rape of Nanking. Therefore, it was not prosperity or even peace that Mao Zedong declared; rather, it was the existence of a fighting spirit—China would never again be held at the mercy of others. This commitment to reconstruction and a renewal of strength, while certainly not a justification for the pains of the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward, no doubt promised the possibility of a future where prosperity and peace would be attainable. </p>

<p>But why does this matter to me? Why is it that my eyes cloud up when I read about the tumultuous history that the Chinese people have lived through though I was born and educated in America? Why did I feel an overwhelming wave of pride when I watched the opening ceremony for the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008? I certainly did not live through these past sixty years of development, nor have I ever fought or suffered for China. But, I suppose, my existence is a result of this history and so I have always felt a natural sense of profound gratitude and devotion toward the motherland of my parents. This, I am sure, is also nourished by my close relationship with my mother, who has allowed me to live somewhat vicariously through her experiences. </p>

<p>Mine is a unique and somewhat unsettling point of view to have as an American. While bookstores carry titles exposing the atrocities of the Mao era, I see the same time through my mother’s eyes. As a junior high student, my mother eagerly volunteered to be shipped to the rural countryside to work as a farmer. Life was harsh and her education was significantly delayed, but what she remembers most prominently is the kindness and humbleness of the villagers she lived with and the camaraderie that existed among the youths.</p>

<p>Similarly, though Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party are widely vilified in “Western” culture, the choices of my grandparents have taught me that no situation is as simple as it seems. Coming from a well-off and politically active background, my father’s family suffered immensely during the Cultural Revolution. They were stripped of their belongings, publicly humiliated at rallies, and thrown into prison because they were seen as deviants and threats to the accepted ideology. Yet, until her death in Beijing, my grandmother’s devotion to the Communist Party, her country, and its potential has never wavered. It seems she has always seen a China beyond that of Mao’s shadow and the actions of the few (though in China that may mean millions); choosing to observe and trust in the macroscopic direction of positivity China is progressing towards instead of condemning the government for its failures, though she has every reason to do so.</p> 

<p>It is with this multi-generational and cautious perspective that I view the current media coverage of the political and ethnic clashes in Tibet and Xinjiang that have come to define the West’s perspective of China. While I am in no position to dispute facts reported about specific incidents, what I do notice is an extreme lack of both historical and present-day context in the reports. For example, though the handling of the Uighur uprising was bloody and may have been oppressive, what is China’s general policy on minority issues? I am certainly no expert on this matter, but what I do know is that minorities are not subject to the One-Child regulation and are encouraged via an affirmative action of sorts to pursue higher education—none of which has been reported or even disproved by the media.</p>

<p>This selective representation of China is unjust and particularly influential.  Though the Chinese government is itself a master manipulator of the media, it has little power to manipulate the American image because American pop culture is so incredibly pervasive and self-propagating. Conversely, American information about China is almost always filtered through what media sources decide to report. This is particularly dangerous, as it leads to an insensitivity and lack of understanding of the Chinese people’s perspective and does not particularly facilitate a desire to learn more.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, last semester, recognizing my own biases, I found myself quite enthused to attend the Dalai Lama’s visit to Berkeley in an effort to better understand the person whom the “West” so fervently supports in the issue of Tibet. I did not expect to first be presented with a speech by Sharon Stone, who had in previous months made the statement, without apology, that the Sichuan Earthquake which killed over 68,000 people was in fact a result of “Karma. When you’re not nice then bad things happen to you.” Suffice it to say, it was difficult to sustain a neutral opinion for the remainder of the program, as I felt angered and disappointed in the organizers of the event. If the same comments had been made about 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina, such a person would never have been invited to instruct virtue.</p>

<p>October 1, 2009 is the sixtieth anniversary of the People’s Republic of China and the government has planned an enormous parade to take place in Beijing. Being an American, it is almost like a coming out of the closet experience for me to admit that I am immensely proud of the progress China has made these past sixty years. Stripping away the controversies and continuous strife, what is evident is that the majority of people in China have food to put on the table and a sense of newfound opportunity—this is a feat in itself. As a nation that has “stood up” from a state of decay, China must continue to be progressive and handle its deficiencies and faults with the responsibility of a major member of the global community. In return, China must be viewed critically, constructively, and within the context of the ashes it has risen from.</p>
