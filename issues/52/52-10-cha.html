<p>If you feel like you haven&#146;t seen enough American flags on campus lately, 
  there is one more flag to check out in between the cascading cement blocks of 
  the newly seismically retrofitted Berkeley Art Museum. A flag that resembles 
  the good old stars and stripes hangs in one of the galleries as the only piece 
  in color by the Korean American avant-garde artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. With 
  no more than forty-eight stars, this flag reminds us that the number of stars 
  on the American flag grew as a function of American imperialist expansion. Stamped 
  vertically in contrast with the lovely white of the second stripe, the letters 
  A M E R signify a fading America. &#147;Amer,&#148; the French word for bitterness, 
  can also be read as &#147;a mer,&#148; French for &#147;to the sea.&#148; People 
  who adamantly politicize art may want to read &#147;a mer&#148; as a reference 
  to Manifest Destiny via the Lousiana Purchase to the Pacific. The strict formalist 
  would adamantly deny the political aspect of the piece and claim it an expression 
  of post-modern uncertainty despite its formal similarity to the American flag. 
  However, titled &#147;The Dream of the Audience,&#148; the Theresa Hak Kyung 
  Cha exhibit specifically questions the boundaries between art and politics, 
  questioning the very act of representation and interpretation. </p>
<p>Often, Asian American art, at best, is only applauded as a degenerate hybrid 
  of East-meets-West kitsch or art with &#147;Oriental&#148; sensibility, even 
  when a piece proves absolutely irrelevant to Asia. The supposed banality of 
  this hybrid art cannot compete with the supposed mastery of modern Western avant-garde 
  gambit that relies on clich&eacute;d Orientalist and Primitivist schemes characterizing 
  the works of Degas, Gaugin, and Picasso. </p>
<p>While many of us are still discovering the empowering medium of spoken word 
  (perhaps looking down at non-identity art as white-washed while we so eagerly 
  await representation), at a time where &#147;ethnic&#148; is the trend in popular 
  culture, most current art critics consider Identity Art pass&eacute;. The interest 
  in multiculturalism in the late 80&#146;s and early 90&#146;s put many minority 
  artists in America in a catch-22: the sudden interest in &#147;ethnic&#148; 
  channeled artists to engage only in projects that narrated their &#147;ethnic&#148; 
  experience to spice up a bland, &#147;colorless&#148; artscene, where both whites 
  and people of color tended to sociologize Asian American art. At the same time, 
  art from a minority artist can only capture interest if it fits into the dominant 
  narrative of immigration and racism, anything more radical or political is considered 
  too controversial. </p>
<p>However, Cha&#146;s work transcends Identity Art without sacrificing a politicalness 
  even two decades before The Joy Luck Club&#146;s disturbing popularity plagued 
  the circle of Asian American literati and artists. Theresa Cha employs videos 
  and performance art, coinciding with the New media art movements of her time, 
  which emphasizes the process rather than product in order to reject the materialism 
  associated with mainstream America. The New media movement demanded new methods 
  of exhibition to reject the conventional forms of making, exhibiting, and marketing 
  art.</p>
<p>With the Theresa Cha exhibit, the museum takes on the curatorial challenge 
  of displaying artwork designed for the purpose of circumventing traditional 
  methods of exhibition. Delighting the viewing public familiar with Cha, the 
  sensitive installation of the collection allows one to stand in the very same 
  space that Cha once stood, for Cha frequented the Berkeley Art Museum during 
  her studies at UC Berkeley from 1964-1978. Visually, BAM makes an appropriate 
  space for the exhibit as the controversial rawness of the concrete contrasts 
  yet complements the organic feeling of Cha&#146;s many muslin cloth canvases, 
  and stark lettering.</p>
<p>An eerie relationship of familiarity forms between the artist and the viewer 
  as one listens to clips of Cha&#146;s soft yet persistent voice accompanying 
  many of the pieces. The availability of this disembodied voice compliments the 
  theme of exile in her work; not only does her work address the separation of 
  space, but also that of time.<br>
  The audience&#146;s insatiable appetite for the authenticity of the artist parallels 
  the colonial subject&#146;s thirst for the recovery of a &#147;truthful,&#148; 
  untold history. While we lament that the only available record of Cha&#146;s 
  performance pieces are photographic stills that in no way render the 3-dimentionality 
  and the temporality of her performances, these excerpted records remind the 
  viewer that the very process of exhibiting Cha&#146;s art reflects curatorial 
  selectivity. Because Cha&#146;s work precisely documents the fracturing and 
  mediation of information, the museum&#146;s archiving and rarifying Cha&#146;s 
  performance fragments add another layer to the exhibit. Close-ups of her family 
  photos and shots of her hand only give us glimpses of Cha, leaving ambiguous 
  unseen spaces where the artist and art piece function as the &#147;dream of 
  the audience.&#148; </p>
<p>Labeling Cha a Korean American artist is ironic, for her art contests categorization, 
  formation of boundaries that reject and alienate. At the same time, the very 
  center of her work relays the fracturing of the colonized in colonial repression, 
  the French Catholic&#146;s demanding the Korean subject to be the dictee, the 
  Japanese&#146;s denying Koreans the right to speak in their native tongue. While 
  recognizing that Cha&#146;s artistry lies in her emphasis on indeterminancy, 
  it should not surprise anyone why her art speaks so strongly to a Korean American 
  immigrant. </p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Cha&#146;s history: she was born in Korea in 1951. 
  Like the Korean heroine Yu Guan Soon, she was born of one mother and one father. 
  Shortly after the Cold War began, when Amer Ican inter vention in Ko Rea drew 
  an in visible boundary dividing arbitrary, ideological north and south, Cha&#146;s 
  family moved to San Francisco in political exile after sojourning in Hawaii 
  in 1964. Cha enrolled in a Catholic high school and entered the University of 
  San Francisco for a semester before enrolling at Cal, where she frequently shared 
  rides with Foucault to the airport. The influence of French thought on her work 
  ranges from watching Godard&#146;s Alphaville, where the female protagonist 
  must relearn language to regain her individuality, to studying abroad in the 
  EAP Paris program. </p>
<p>Although Cha&#146;s art was inspired by a period where new French theorists 
  attempted to reject traditional perceptions of time and narration, a period 
  where the university created new departments such as Ethnic studies and women&#146;s 
  studies, a period where artists in the bay area engaged in performance happenings 
  to reject traditional museum spaces, she did start moving toward the more traditional 
  forms of exhibition in the late 70s and early 80s. In 1980, she moved to New 
  York to pursue a promising career that was unfortunately short-lived. On November 
  5, 1982, Cha was murdered by a security guard in the Puck Building on Lafayette 
  Street in lower Manhattan while waiting for her husband. When she was murdered 
  she was about to send the first edition of Dictee to her mother.</p>
<p>In Dictee, arguably Cha&#146;s most mature piece, Cha addresses her displacement 
  without romanticizing a lost history, she puts letterings in scrapbook form 
  to call attention to the very act of collecting, piecing together fragments 
  that lack fluid connections. Dictee takes the form of what many critics consider 
  a nationalist, counter-hegemonic autobiography, poetry, history that records 
  the contribution of female heroines such as Yu Guan soon, Korean martyr during 
  Japanese Imperialism, and Joan of Arc. The very act of exhibiting and anthologizing 
  the heroines&#146; accomplishments also serves to decontextualize these heroine&#146;s 
  lives, fragmenting their stories to show that their tales were irrecoverable 
  as subjects of oppression. The book bombards the viewer/reader with images but 
  no explanation of who they are.</p>
<p>Although the book collects images of her heroines, much of the book and her 
  other work relies on the anti-aesthetic medium of languages. As Cha describes 
  her work: &#147;the main body of my work is with language before it is born 
  on the tip of the tongue.&#148; Cha composes poetry with grammar book exercises, 
  transforming the most basic and mundane structure of language into poetically 
  dense fragments to subvert the dominant notion of language and linguistics. 
  Her deconstruction lies not in simply pointing out the grammatical structure, 
  but conveying the meaning and translation and transliteration of languages, 
  as she believes foreigners can achieve a detachment and find patterns not always 
  obvious to the native speakers of a language. </p>
<p>If you feel like you haven&#146;t seen enough Asian American literature/art 
  revolving around the generational gap between Asian females lately, check out 
  the new cover of DICTEE. The original front and back covers of Dictee were designed 
  by Cha, where the front cover purposely features an obscure landscape atypical 
  on covers of Asian American books. The original back cover, equally obscure 
  features a cropped picture of nine girls without any textual explanation, a 
  purposeful attempt to decontextualize the book to bring up the notion of indeterminancy. 
  However, the new cover on the UC press edition of Dictee features a picture 
  of Cha&#146;s mother, signifying loudly that Dictee is an Asian American novel 
  that follows the trite dominant immigrant narrative of generational conflicts 
  between Asian American women. Perhaps the new cover will sell the book better, 
  especially since the new back cover also includes a blurb on the life and art 
  of Theresa Cha, going against the purposeful lack of explanation on the original 
  back cover. </p>
<p>However, instead of getting mad at UC press for changing the original, we should 
  realize that Cha&#146;s work has always anticipated change, for she likes to 
  bring attention to the ephemerality of things. Dictee, now changed by the publisher, 
  makes us question the way we tend to fetishize the authenticity of the artist, 
  comparable the fetishization of the authentic &#147;other&#148; experience. 
  Even Cha herself said in her art &#147;i address you/ as i would a distant relative/ 
  as if a distant relative/ seen only heard only through someone else&#146;s/ 
  description.&#148;</p>
<p>For the avid art collector, Dictee is probably the most affordable masterpiece. 
  Don&#146;t miss the Cha exhibit at the Berkeley Art Museum. Exhibit will go 
  on till December 6th.</p> </td>
