<p>For a long time now, India has been producing more films per year than any 
  other country in the world &#150; a fact that may be surprising considering 
  Hollywood&#146;s global media hegemony. But it is this prolific output from 
  the subcontinent that has combined &#145;Bombay&#146;, the center of the move 
  production in India, with &#145;Hollywood&#146; to create the nickname &#145;Bollywood&#146;, 
  referring to the Indian film industry. Sure, even with so many films, the Indian 
  products are mostly the same old trite romantic musicals; but, then again, who 
  could really characterize Hollywood flicks as even mildly original?</p>
<p>With this in mind, it may be curious that you&#146;ve probably never seen any 
  of these movies on the shelves at your local video store &#150; until now, that 
  is. Last year&#146;s &#145;biggest Bollywood film ever&#146;, Lagaan, was released 
  in theatres around the world, is now in stock at Blockbuster, and this year 
  became the third Indian-language movie ever nominated for a Best Foreign Film 
  Oscar.</p>
<p>On the surface, the epic Lagaan seems to set itself far apart from all the 
  unoriginal Hindi films. Set during British colonialism in 1893, the film centers 
  on a village suffering a three-year drought. In short, the colonial bastard, 
  Captain Russell, announces that the village will now have to pay double tax 
  (dugna lagaan). The village men confront him and agree to his wager that if 
  they defeat his men in a cricket match, they won&#146;t have to pay. An anti-colonial 
  tax revolt through a cricket match? Throw in a love triangle between the village 
  hero, a village belle, and a British woman, and you&#146;ve got an Oscar nomination.</p>
<p>Beneath the surface, however, the movie is just as problematic, if not more, 
  than anything else coming out of Bollywood. Lagaan offers an incredibly masculinist 
  interpretation of the fictional historical events; you can feel the testosterone 
  dripping off the screen like the beads of sweat rolling off Aamir Khan&#146;s 
  chest. The few women in the film play only auxiliary roles, as usual, and the 
  movie sends the message that it is intense masculinity that defeats colonialism. 
</p>
<p>In the context of colonialism, it is easy to understand that the &#145;pro-India&#146; 
  messages equate evenly with anti-British sentiment in 1893. However, at the 
  height of an intense conflict between India and Pakistan, that brand of patriotism 
  translates to anti-Pakistan, and in turn, anti-Muslim attitudes today. After 
  all, the convergence of the current Hindu nationalist government in India, the 
  nationalistic showdown with Pakistan, and the recent wave of extremely popular 
  nationalist films (e.g. Lagaan and Gadar &#150; the two biggest Bollywood films 
  in 2001) is not coincidental.</p>
<p>Lagaan, like all other nationalist projects, offers its prescription of what 
  constitutes &#145;true&#146; Indian-ness. Why did the men end up playing cricket 
  in the first place? Because when Capt. Russell originally offered to cancel 
  the tax only if the Indian prince of that region ate a small bit of meat, the 
  leader refused &#150; like any &#145;real&#146; Hindu would. <br>
  The movie has done what no other recent Indian film has been able to &#150; 
  transcend Bollywood in some ways and gain respect from Western critics, as though 
  their approval somehow legitimates the work. Released worldwide in June 2001, 
  I saw Lagaan in a film house in Nairobi, Kenya, packed with South Asians whose 
  ancestors were brought to East Africa by the British to build the railroads. 
  Talk about a diasporic moment. </p>
<p>On March 24, Lagaan could be the first Indian film to win an Oscar. While at 
  first it seems very different from other Bollywood flicks, it may just be the 
  same testosterone-driven storyline with an underdeveloped love story thrown 
  in the mix. Given all the valid criticisms, the movie is admittedly very entertaining, 
  the story is engaging, and the songs/choreography are put together well. If 
  you&#146;ve got three hours and forty-five minutes, be sure to watch Lagaan, 
  like all other media, with a critical eye of course.</p>
