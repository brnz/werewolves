      <p align="justify"><em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&ldquo;Not since the Romans salted the land after destroying </strong></font></em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Carthage has a nation taken such pains to visit the war on  future generations.&rdquo; - Ngo Van Long, speaking on the US war against Vietnam. </em></font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em></em></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1975,  thousands of people across the globe watched as US military helicopters  airlifted American and Vietnamese personnel out of Saigon.  For many, the event symbolized the loss of the war, a retreat for US forces,  and the end of American involvement in the region. For those who remained in Vietnam, however, the war would continue on, the remnants of  which have affected generations born after the fighting&rsquo;s end.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Among the more  lasting effects of the war have been the havoc wreaked by the US&rsquo;s environmental warfare strategies. In Vietnam, the US military faced an unfamiliar terrain covered with fields and forests that provided sanctuary and food for the enemy troops. In the  face of the guerilla warriors&rsquo; home field advantage, American troops did what  they could to gain an edge: they burned down the field. And the forests and  just about everything that lived in them, with little regard for the natural  habitat of Vietnam or its people. Thousands of Vietnamese who resided in  the countryside and depended on the land for sustenance were forced away from  their ancestral homes into the major cities. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the main techniques the US military employed was the use of conventional  explosives dropped from B- 52s and other bombers. These bombs, some weighing as  much as 15,000 pounds, were dropped indiscriminately, onto all types of  habitats, and created over twenty million craters in South Vietnam. The craters crippled local farming by uprooting and  exposing the subsoil, ruining the ability of the farmers to raise crops. They  also made for great breeding spots for mosquitoes; the craters, ranging from five to fifteen feet deep, would fill with water, and, coupled with the hot and  humid weather of the region, allowed for the spread of the malaria-carrying  insects.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The US also destroyed thousands of acres of land in its  attempts to create landing zones for their helicopters. One of the bombs the  military used was the aforementioned 15,000-pound &quot;daisy cutter.&quot;  Capable of clearing an area the size of a football field, the daisy cutter  blew away all vegetation and completely removed all trees in the vicinity.  Before the war, Vietnam had been self-sufficient for lumber. However, the massive uprooting  and shrapnel that was lodged in the trees made most of the wood incapable of  being processed, as the trees became susceptible to infection. Through all this,  the land was stripped of its vegetation and overrun with weeds; while the  Vietnamese government has made efforts to replant the forests, much of the land  today is waste.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But by far the most infamous of the strategies the US military undertook during the Vietnam war was the use  of chemical herbicides, of which Agent Orange is the most notorious. Starting  in 1961, over a hundred thousand tons of these herbicides were sprayed over Vietnam&rsquo;s forests, through helicopters, boats, and troops with  the poisons dispelled from their backpacks. The herbicides destroyed the land,  the dead trees totaling an area the size of Connecticut. The poison also hit hard the animal and plant life  that the Vietnamese peasants and troops depended on. Despite being denied  covering and food, however, the guerilla forces still were able to carry on the  war, though at great cost to the local people. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the herbicides used, Agent  Orange was by far the deadliest. Agent Orange contains dioxin, an organic  compound that is recognized as one of the most toxic pollutants in the  world. The effects of the poison range from nausea and vomiting to mental  retardation and death. According to some American researchers, up to 4.8  million Vietnamese may have been exposed to the toxins, and in 2000, at least  one million were physically disabled because of the exposure. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The poison&rsquo;s  effects have not been limited to those alive during the Vietnam War, but have  been passed on to new generations of children who are born with birth defects  caused by Agent Orange. Many parents may have unknowingly been exposed to  herbicides, either directly or indirectly, for example, through consuming  poisoned fish. The children are born mentally retarded and suffer from a  variety of physical deformities. Due to the extreme poverty many of the  families live in, raising a child with such handicaps is an option few are able  to afford. Families cannot live on the wages of one member, but taking care of  a disabled child requires the full time and attention of one of the parents.  The Vietnamese government gives a $16-a-month stipend for families, but many  children are abandoned or sent to group homes. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To date, the US government has not assumed responsibility for these  environmental atrocities. Congress has already passed legislation providing  assistance for American veterans suffering from dioxin, though stated that the  links between the herbicides and the illnesses were &quot;presumptive.&quot; In  1984, American veterans also won a $180 million settlement against the  manufacturers of Agent Orange. However, a similar suit filed by the Vietnam  Association for Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin in 2004 was dismissed on the  grounds that Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law  at the time of its use, thus shielding the US government and the manufacturers it contracted out  from liability. The case is currently being appealed. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently, efforts have  been made to clean up the aftermath of Agent Orange and other herbicides. The US government has committed $300,000 to removing the  toxic chemicals from the soil of the different hot spots, with the United  Nations set to contribute in the near future. The Ford Foundation has also  recently that it will be giving $2.2 million towards restoring the environment  and providing healthcare for the victims. However, a joint study between the US and Vietnamese government on the health and  environmental effects of Agent Orange was halted when the US pulled out, citing communication failures. The study  could have affirmed the toxin&rsquo;s link to the victims&rsquo; health problems,  a link that the chemical manufacturers of Agent Orange still deny. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the end  however, millions of Vietnamese have suffered injuries and indignities that  money will be unable to heal. So long as the government that afflicted these  hardships on these people remains immune from liability, from acknowledging the  atrocities it has enacted, it is not difficult to see how and why these events  may occur again, why these lessons may go unlearned. And for the victims, there  is undoubtedly little comfort in that.</font></p>
