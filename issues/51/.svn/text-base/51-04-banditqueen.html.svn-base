<p>&#147;She&#146;s a woman - and low caste.&#148; This was told to her repeatedly, 
  throughout her life. This is why she could not do things, would not be allowed 
  to do things. In the face of these words, she rose from a poor village girl, 
  abused and violated, to a fierce bandit queen hunted by the police, to the voice 
  of a silenced people. Phoolan Devi, was gunned down outside her home in New 
  Dehli by several armed, masked men on July 25, 2001. Throughout India, millions 
  mourned the death of their own Robin Hood. The 38 year old member of Parliament, 
  according to political journalist Harsh Khare, represented the &#147;new assertive 
  political and social forces&#148; that stood against an old order. But for many 
  Indians, she was infinitely more than a lofty politician arguing for their case 
  in rhetoric and policies. She was both the embodiment and the avenger of the 
  oppression of the lower castes. </p>
<p>The beginnings of the legend start in what is still called the &#147;real India.&#148; 
  Phoolan was born in 1963, in Gorha Ka Purwa, a small village of Uttar Pradesh, 
  in Northern India. Seventy percent of women are born and die in village very 
  similar to this one. She was born to one of the lowest castes&#151;that of the 
  Mallahs, or the boatmen and fishermen. Although an official caste system is 
  illegal, most of life pivoted on this regime. </p>
<p>As a woman, one is even further down the ladder, for a daughter entails dowry 
  and burden. Her worth will be defined by producing sons and working in the fields. 
  The destiny of geography, caste, and poverty are inescapable. </p>
<p>But even as a child, Phoolan Devi raised her voice against injustice. Her father 
  was cheated of land by his brother and nephew, both better politically connected. 
  She, outraged, arranged a sit in and taunted her cousin Maiyadin. For her troubles 
  she was beaten unconscious with a brick. In retaliation he forced her into marriage 
  at the age of 11 to a man thrice her age for the price of a cow. </p>
<p>Her husband, despite her youth, forced himself upon her and beat her frequently. 
  So she left, barely age 12, trekking across a distance the width of Texas. But 
  women cannot simply leave their husbands. Her family shunned her, even advising 
  suicide. So she grew a scorned woman. Throughout, she continued the battle against 
  her cousin for her fathers land. Although illiterate, at the age of 20, she 
  managed to take the case before the Alahabad High Court. This also did not go 
  unavenged. At 21, she was arrested on trumped charges of robbery at Miyadin&#146;s 
  house, and spent a month in police custody. And is common with women in custody, 
  she was beaten and raped. <br>
  The next stage of her life is blurred in the various myths and stories. The 
  dacoits, or bandits, came to the village. Perhaps she was kidnapped, sold, or 
  maybe she simply went. Whatever the case, she was with them. For three days 
  she was brutalized by the bandit leader, Babu Gujar, until Vikram Mallah, second 
  in command and also of her caste, shot him and assumed leadership. Phoolan became 
  his mistress and he taught her everything he knew. </p>
<p>Along the Chambal River Valley, for generations, people took justice into their 
  own hands. The dacoits had always carried an air of romance and adventure. For 
  most, it was an issue of land. They died and fought for it. One officer leading 
  the fight against bandits cited revenge: &#147;if the system gives you no justice, 
  then you take justice into your own hands. And, I am very sorry to say, many 
  become dacoits because of the high-handedness of the police: beatings, inefficiency, 
  fear.&#148; And so Phoolan Devi became a bandit. </p>
<p>For a year they roamed the states of Uttar and Madyha Pradesh, robbing and 
  looting, until Vikram is shot dead by brother dacoits Sri Ram and Lala Ram, 
  of upper caste, in vengeance. She herself was bound and gagged and taken to 
  the village of Behmai, composed of 50 or so mostly upper caste families. </p>
<p>Although Phoolan refused to discuss it, witnesses say she was kept in a dark 
  hut for three weeks. Supposedly, every night, bol. The product of the worst 
  problems in a unjust social structure, she rose against it viciously. And thus 
  captured the passions of a people. </p>
<p>&#147;It would be have been impossible for Phoolan to be anything but an Indian,&#148; 
  said syndicated comnist Sunil Sethi, &#147;and she is tailor-made for the Indian 
  imagination: since ancient times we have had an inordinate capacity to make 
  myth out of any story, and to demythicize the most epic into the most mundane. 
  Phoolan is a do-it-yourself goddess who can rapidly demonize.&#148; And thus 
  an illiterate low caste fisherman&#146;s daughter became a story about India 
  itself. </p>
