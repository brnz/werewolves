    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext">For generations the “child disciplinary actions” that occur within Asian families have gone unnoticed. According to ModelMinority, an organization dedicated to Asian American empowerment, “Child maltreatment among Asian Americans…remains unexposed…for its lack of visibility.” The problem lies here: unreliable stories such as parents hitting an infant or teachers punishing students with bamboo sticks for academic shortcomings create a sense, in America, that Asian Americans are constantly in turmoil.<p><br>
The National Statistics for Child Abuse reports that child abuse among Asians consists of only one percent of all reported child abuse cases. However, according to another study conducted by PubMed, an institute dedicated to family health, “73% of the South Asian and Middle Eastern sample, 65% of the East Asian sample, and 78% of the Latina sample reported experiencing at least one type of physical abuse.” Of the subject tested, “100 percent did not report the physical abuse to authorities”.<p><br>
Misunderstandings about Asian culture have tainted the Asian image, namely in the parenthood category. It is important to shed light on Asian culture to understand why misunderstandings on the issue of physical punishment occur.<p><br>
Different Asian American groups have started to address the issues of physical punishment and cultural difference. Groups such as the Coalition for Asian American Children and Families (CAACF) located in New York City and Asian Americans for Community Involvement located in Cupertino, California have tried to bridge the cultural gap in parenting between Caucasian Americans and Asian Americans. The CAACF acknowledges that child welfare policies and services are rarely designed to meet the needs of the Asian American community. It advocates that immigrant families understand the consequences of child abuse in the US, but it also demands an understanding on the part of child welfare professionals so that an ideal balance in resolving cultural differences can be established.
Physical discipline lies at the root of Asian culture. Asian culture recognizes a strict disciplinary structure within families, according to ModelMinority. The teachings of Confucius, for example, places extreme emphasis on filial piety, where the father figure exercises enormous power over their children and, conversely, a child must show respect and obedience towards his or her parents. Han Fei, another well-known Chinese philosopher, created what is known today as Legalism. He argues that people are inherently immoral and punishment is the only way to rectify this innate evil. Asian culture has been strongly influenced by both philosophers, and many Asian families continue to draw upon the teachings of both Confucius and Han Fei.<p><br>
The potential shame of losing face, of embarrassing the family name, and of disregarding family loyalty, has also influenced Asian culture and the methods families use in raising their children. Often times, Asian parents will promote high standards to prevent children from staining the family name. ModelMinority confirms this observation in an article discussing child abuse, noting that “Asian parents often place unrealistically high expectations for their children.”<p><br>
In Asia, physical discipline is not a subject of legal dispute because is culturally accepted and popularly practiced. For such cultures, “child abuse” is a foreign concept. In Vietnam, physical discipline is the traditional method of raising children and is an integral part of Vietnamese culture. However, in the United States, physical discipline used on children in any way is against the law. The current US federal definition of child abuse, taken directly from the 1974 legislation is: “at minimum, any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.” The statement “serious physical or emotional harm” is very vague and difficult to define. According to an article in Model Minority, “Asians have commonly believed that child abuse is only defined as extreme physical torture exerted on a child.” For many Asian families, it is assumed that, “physical punishment or discipline by striking a child does not qualify as abuse.”<p><br>
Physical discipline is increasingly becoming a problem within Asian communities in American society. With an influx of Asian immigrants, it is important to understand that they bring with them customs and values that differ from American culture. Culture clashes create misunderstandings which cause tension within American society; in order to bridge the cultural gap, it is crucial to make informed judgements. Asian American immigrants usually struggle between assimilating into a new society and preserving one’s own cultural background, usually finding some sort of middle ground. An understanding of different aspects of cultures will allow facilitation in discussing different ideologies, and hopefully a path to awareness and compromise.
