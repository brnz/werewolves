    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p>What Bollywood movie 
        would your vagina star in? What would your vagina&#8217;s bio-data say? 
        Is your vagina veg or non-veg? Sounds like a Desi&#8217;d up version of 
        the Vagina Monologues&#8230; could it really be? <br>
        <br>
        Indeed, Desi women are ready to go public with their private parts! South 
        Asian Sisters, a collective of progressive South Asian women from a variety 
        of geographical and educational backgrounds, exemplifies the creative 
        activism that is taking place to combat oppression within and against 
        our communities. Among their upcoming projects is a full-scale production 
        of Eve Ensler&#8217;s Vagina Monologues, with a distinctly Desi flavor. 
        The event will be entitled &#8220;Yoni Ki Baat&#8221; and is tentatively 
        scheduled for late April.<br>
        <br>
        The inspiration for this project came from personal contacts of South 
        Asian Sisters: Deepti Sudhindra and Ruchika Chanana, the producer and 
        director, respectively, of the first-ever Vagina Monologues to be performed 
        in India. The highly successful Kamaaya Productions event took place in 
        Bangalore in July 2002, but unfortunately endured&nbsp;its expected share 
        of backlash. One group of lawyers even threatened legal action against 
        the performers, citing vulgarity as a potential criminal charge.<br>
        <br>
        Though there is no&nbsp;question that&nbsp;the Monologues&nbsp;can be 
        incisively irreverent, the purpose of the project is to empower women 
        with a voice against violence and provide a safe and relatively light-hearted 
        space to discuss issues ranging from menstruation, masturbation, and orgasm 
        to abuse and genital mutilation. Maulie Dass, co-founder of South Asian 
        Sisters, says the organizers hope to outreach to South Asian women of 
        all generations and ensure that all languages and sexual orientations 
        are represented and respected. A large email questionnaire will be sent 
        to hundreds of South Asian women in the next few weeks, and their responses 
        will be compiled into short skits and monologues performed by five or 
        six women. &#8220;This will be a women&#8217;s only event, for both comfort 
        reasons as well as to gauge reception,&#8221; Dass says, but non-South 
        Asian sisters are also welcome to attend.<br>
        <br>
        The mission of South Asian Sisters is to empower, support, and educate 
        South Asian women around the world; to create a collective for women of 
        color; to counsel women on topics including health care and legal rights; 
        and to create an online community with event postings, classifieds, articles, 
        art, and other resources. A self-defined feminist space in the South Asian 
        diaspora, the women&#8217;s collective created a website in 2000 and gathered 
        momentum as an organization in the summer of 2002, demanding a space within 
        the South Asian progressive space to ensure that female leadership was 
        upheld and respected. Members are geographically dispersed in the Bay 
        Area, Los Angeles, and Colorado, and come from a variety of backgrounds, 
        languages, and careers, including education, health, journalism, and engineering. 
        The organization operates on a model of mutual empowerment between South 
        Asian residents and residents of the diaspora, and maintains contacts 
        in Bangalore and Sri Lanka to learn more about events, actions, and issues 
        that are both domestic and global.<br>
        <br>
        The founders recently held a workshop on South Asian Feminism at the South 
        Asian Progressive Conference on January 25 in San Francisco. &#8220;Many 
        sisters were there and all had some really important and empowering dialogue,&#8221; 
        Dass says, &#8220;but it&#8217;s just the start, and that&#8217;s where 
        our meetings come in.&#8221; At meetings, members organize events and 
        brainstorm issues that pertain to South Asian women. Past topics have 
        included body image and sexual harassment at Desi parties.<br>
        <br>
        Other proposed projects include marching with Trikone (a South Asian gay/ 
        lesbian/ bisexual/ transgender organization) in the Pride parade, a clothesline 
        project in collaboration with an NGO in Sri Lanka, and a South Asian progressive 
        gathering for women only.</p>
