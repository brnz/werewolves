    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p>On November 15, U.S. 
        District Judge Robert Takasugi issued a preliminary injunction banning 
        the portion of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that prohibited 
        non-citizens from being airport security screeners, an act passed in the 
        wake of the 9/11 attacks. <br>
        The injunction, which bans the enforcement of the citizenship requirement, 
        is understood to be effective nationwide, applying to the estimated 8000 
        naturalized alien screeners, most of which who have already lost their 
        jobs, as well as non-citizen applicants. The injunction holds until the 
        civil rights lawsuit filed by nine plaintiffs (one of whom is from American 
        Samoa and has been banned from applying as a baggage screener) and the 
        American Civil Liberties Union is taken to trial. The plaintiffs were 
        of Los Angeles and San Francisco International Airports. As of November 
        15, no trial date has been set. <br>
        <br>
        The judge&#8217;s ruling stated the plaintiffs had &#8220;sufficiently 
        alleged a constitutional deprivation to warrant a finding irreparable 
        harm.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        Alba Reyes, among the plaintiffs, said of her fellow alleged security 
        threat screeners, &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of hard working people that 
        have been working for years and obviously they&#8217;re not a problem. 
        It was unfair. They were qualified and they deserve a better job.&#8221;<br>
        ACLU lawyers hope the decision would be conducive to passing a congressional 
        amendment allowing U.S. nationals to hold airport security screening jobs. 
        The amendment is currently before the U.S. Senate. <br>
        <br>
        Mike Rosenbaum, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California 
        likens the government&#8217;s acts of firing non-citizens from screening 
        jobs to the Japanese internment that occurred during World War II. &#8220;You&#8217;re 
        classifying a group of non-citizens as inherently dangerous,&#8221; he 
        stated. He also noted that the act did not demand citizenship requirements 
        of other airport workers &#8220;from the pilots to the cargo handlers 
        to people work in the gift shop.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        Although the injunction will not return jobs to the affected screeners, 
        it will allow them to be eligible for future openings. </p>
