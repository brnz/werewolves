    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> Hollywood has finally 
        come up with a mainstream movie starring a South Asian, and unfortunately 
        for all, that movie is Universal&#8217;s The Guru.<br>
        <br>
        Jimi Mistry stars as Ramu Gupta, who comes to America with the hopes of 
        becoming a movie star. He accidentally gets introduced to the world of 
        adult film and meets Sharona, (Heather Graham) who imparts her sexual 
        wisdom to him. Ramu in turn uses this information to become the &#8220;sexual 
        guru&#8221; of the upper-west side, encouraged by the wealthy Lexi (Marisa 
        Tomei.)<br>
        <br>
        Though the movie claims to be sensitive to the stereotypes South Asians 
        face in film and in life, it nevertheless resorts to those same stereotypes 
        over and over again to illicit cheap laughs. The notorious, &quot;don't 
        get your turban in a twist&quot; line generated a chuckle from the audience; 
        however, it is those kinds of jokes that simply perpetuate negative South 
        Asian stereotypes in pop culture. Perhaps I wouldn't be taking those jokes 
        so seriously had I not been made acutely aware that the actors themselves 
        are blind to their own ignorance. On The Guru&#8217;s official website, 
        Graham said of the dance sequences in the film, &#8220;I got to be in 
        an Indian dance sequence which was like a Hindu movie, a Bollywood movie, 
        and I got to sing in Hindu.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        One of the main themes that the filmmakers are pushing is that The Guru 
        is a fusion of Hollywood and Bollywood (India&#8217;s equivalent to Hollywood). 
        The problem with this mix is that Indian movies cannot be viewed under 
        the same lens as American movies. Indian Americans view Bollywood movies 
        on an altogether different plane than American ones. They appreciate Bollywood 
        movies as unique to their culture, something that cannot be incorporated 
        easily in an essentially completely different genre. The Guru, however, 
        uses the musical numbers seen in Indian movies in a way that cheapens 
        the spirit in which they are meant to be used and turns it into a cheesy 
        display of colors and costumes. Screenwriter Tracy Jackson commented on 
        the website that The Guru is a &#8220;very real film about very real people, 
        not a sort of sappy, sentimental musical.&#8221; However, The Guru is 
        neither real, nor sappy. To use those terms would imply that the audience 
        cared about the characters and what happened to them.<br>
        <br>
        All cultural issues I have with The Guru aside, it is still a terrible 
        movie on its own merit &#8212; it simply has no redeeming qualities. The 
        dialogue is weak, the directing is mediocre at best, and the acting is 
        non-existent. The real disappointment is Tomei, who just might have been 
        the only one who could have saved this movie from itself, yet somehow 
        couldn&#8217;t pull it together this time. The interesting thing is that 
        the underlying joke of The Guru is making fun of adult films, when the 
        movie itself is nothing better than the average porn flick. It features 
        gratuitous nudity, a weak plot, and Graham herself has, as always, the 
        emotional range of a porn star.<br>
        <br>
        As for the future of South Asians in Hollywood, what we really need now 
        is a mainstream American movie that stars South Asians in roles typically 
        played by white actors. As for The Guru, there is really only one thing 
        left to say: don&#8217;t see it.</p>
