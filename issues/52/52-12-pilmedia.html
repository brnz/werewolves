<p>During the period of the Filipino-American War, the media propagandized the 
  conflict as a battle of asserting the United States&#146; racial and cultural 
  supremacy to lightly disguise the fact that their motives were of economic gain. 
  An exhibit at Pusod, a Filipino American community space in Berkeley, entitled 
  COLORED: Black n&#146; White: Filipinos in American Popular Media, 1896-1907, 
  which ran through October, contains many original color plates of editorial 
  cartoons that depicted the Filipinos as barbaric and primitive, similar to the 
  representations of blacks in America. </p>
<p>The papers that covered the war were Life Magazine (which opposed the war and 
  had a more humanized portrayal of Filipinos), Puck, and Judge, a Republican 
  publication. They tended to show the Filipinos as savages in grass skirts with 
  spears that needed to be &#147;Christianized, uplifted, educated, and cultured.&#148; 
  The media claimed that Filipinos were &#147;barbaric, and incapable of self-government&#148; 
  and that the US was their generous savior of &#147;enlightenment.&#148;</p>
<p>Domestic opponents to the military effort, such as African Americans and writer<br>
  Mark Twain were feminized to suggest that their opposition to imperialism was 
  a result of weakness or a lack of masculinity. However, there were also those 
  who were anti-imperialist for racist purposes: they didn&#146;t want their colonial 
  empire&#146;s annexations to mar the purity of their white race.</p>
<p>The US became involved in an international manifest destiny, following the 
  examples of Germany, Britain, and the Netherlands, to gain access to the trades 
  of Asia. In the Spanish-American War, they easily claimed Puerto Rico, Guam, 
  and Cuba through the Treaty of Paris in 1898. But in the Philippines, the US 
  faced a strong military resistance. </p>
<p>The Philippines had just declared independence from Spain after a successful 
  campaign led by Emilio Aguinaldo, when the US acquired the territory from Spain 
  for $20 million. Aguinaldo was declared president of the Philippine Republic, 
  but the US refused to acknowledge his authority, leading Aguinaldo and his rebel 
  forces to declare war on the US occupying forces. Ending in 1901 with the capture 
  of Aguinaldo, the war has virtually been forgotten as its editorial coverage 
  was sealed in a metaphorical &#147;forbidden book.&#148; Although it was fifty 
  times more costly than the well-known Spanish-American War, it is merely an 
  afterthought, deemed an &#147;insurgency&#148; or &#147;the Philippine Insurrection.&#148; 
</p>
<p>Surprisingly, one of the few reminders of the first protracted war in Southeast 
  Asia is an unobtrusive tribute in San Francisco. Admiral Dewey&#146;s naval 
  victory in Manila is commemorated in Union Square in San Francisco, a somber, 
  obscure monument in a heavily touristed retail area.</p>
<p>The US colonization of the Philippines ended in 1946, after World War II. This 
  colonial domination provided the US with a gateway to China and with cheap immigrant 
  labor, since the Chinese and Japanese laborers were being excluded by discriminator 
  immigration legislation in the US. </p>
<p>As with previous Asian immigration, the US did not consider the possibility 
  that the Filipinos would remain in the US. While the US didn&#146;t want to 
  regard them citizens, Filipinos were US nationals as a result of the countries 
  imperialist efforts. This special status did not protect them from racism; they 
  began to face the same prejudices as the other Asian and black groups, forbidden 
  to intermarry and prohibited from citizenship. However, before the US re-established 
  the independence of the Philippines, Filipinos found employment and ways of 
  avoiding anti-miscegenation laws to find a new life in America, no matter how 
  unwelcome they were.</p>
<p>This exhibit was very timely&#150;coincidentally presented one hundred years 
  later as the same propagandizing of Asians in the media is occurring to propel 
  American righteousness and patriotism while criticizing alien cultures and religions 
  as &#147;savage&#148; and &#147;primitive.&#148; The exhibit also displays the 
  extent to which the depiction of Asians as primitive, feminine, and weak is 
  ingrained in the media.</p>
<p>The location of the exhibit is subtle, but obscure (like the racial significance 
  of Union Square) held at the Pusod Center at 1805 Fifth Street (behind Fourth 
  Street, Berkeley&#146;s pseudo-SoHo of Yuppie ignorance). A house turned into 
  a community space, the organization holds events, classes, and exhibits relevant 
  to race relations and cultural representation.</p>
