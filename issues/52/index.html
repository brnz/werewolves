        note</font></b></p>
      
<p>To our biggest fans:</p>
<p>Thanks for your enthusiastic reception of hb 5.1. We ran out of issues after 
  the first week and a half of distribution. Hopefully this unprecedented historical 
  phenomenon is a sign that API activism is growing at a time when there is little 
  support for critical, oppositional voices in the media.</p>
<p>Now many of you have asked what hardboiled is and what it means (we seem to 
  revisit this question every year), so here&#146;s the answer for the 5 series. 
  Yes, the Founders of hardboiled, the APIA student publication here at Cal, did 
  name it in some sort of reference to that John Woo flick. The term &#147;hardboiled&#148; 
  usually refers to a detective/cop that&#146;s been burned and has become devoid 
  of sentimentality. Former hb editor David K. Song considers the term a way for 
  Asian Americans to assert their American-ness, for the term refers to classic 
  American dime novels (refer to ed note of 3.1). I&#146;ve always thought hardboiled 
  was a funny way of displaying masculinity, since it refers to an egg, a signifier 
  of femininity. But regardless of what hardboiled means, just don&#146;t confuse 
  us with that other eggy publication,Yolk, now that we&#146;ve finally gotten 
  rid of the Asian Avenue ad (hopefully we didn&#146;t lose too much readership 
  over that). An egg, in identity politics of color, being white on the outside 
  and yellow on the inside, is an inverse of a banana or a twinkie. But I&#146;m 
  not exactly into cultural essentialism and pointing fingers as to who is white-washed 
  and who is not.<br>
  <br>
  Instead of talking about yellow-white relations, I would like to address the 
  yellow-brown relationship within the APIA community in light of the recent events. 
  In all our Asian American studies classes, the case of Vincent Chin has always 
  exemplified why we APIAs form coalitions; hate crimes is an issue of racial 
  lumping and affects all members of the APIA community. However, the recent hate 
  crime attacks on one segment of the APIA community has not seemed to get much 
  response from the community as a whole. Shortly after S11, I went to a forum 
  on Asians in the Greek system. Many of the participants, composed of mainly 
  Chinese and Korean Americans, did not feel that racial hate crimes could happen 
  at Cal. This forum took place one day before another forum addressed the recent 
  hate crimes (some on campus) against South Asian, Central Asian, and Southwest 
  Asian Americans. While in some communities, hate crimes and racial profiling 
  are the biggest issues of current concern, others are more concerned about elimination 
  of the SAT I, and often these different interests split along colorlines. Although 
  some of us are feel that yellow and brown were artificially put into the same 
  category as &#147;Asian&#148; simply because the immense size of Asia, many 
  issues still bind us together: Orientalism, the Model-Minority Myth, and being 
  perceived as foreigners or politically apathetic engineers or doctors. </p>
<p>Overall, like many Asian American Studies departments across the country, hb 
  has been too yellow-centric in the past and we are trying hard to increase our 
  brown representation.</p>
<p>Finally, for those of you angry at our publication, please adhere to the following 
  hb etiquettes when expressing your anger:</p>
<p>Do not yell at the tall South Asian guy at Sather Gate just because you dislike 
  a specific article -- that&#146;s what letters to the editors are for. </p>
<p>Do not punch the front cover of the newspaper -- it looks bad when you&#146;re 
  a white guy punching a representation of a Sikh face. </p>
<p>If you feel that hb is not &#147;objective&#148; enough or too &#147;one-sided,&#148; 
  first of all, be wary of anyone that claims to be objective and realize that 
  a centrist voice does not necessarily equate an objective voice (if such a thing 
  actually exists). Secondly, do not start a glossy publication that claims to 
  be &#147;non-partisan&#148; with a huge American Flag on the cover and drain 
  our prop 2 funds when the &#147;non-partisan&#148; view is readily available 
  via the Associate Press, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, and whichever other 
  news station that has received anthrax threats. </p>
<p>And if you&#146;re still angry about the Asian fetish article in issue 3.6, 
  realize that we&#146;re not neo-nazis and we did not say that white men should 
  only date white women. And if you&#146;re still angry after this realization: 
  I have just one recommendation for our Orientalist friends: Hookahs not bazookas!</p>
<p>Peace,<br>
  Yueni Zhong<br>
