25 years later.. remembering Vincent Chin <br><br>

by brian lau <br><br>

It was twenty-five years ago. Twenty-five years remove us from that one Detroit night, from that strip club bar, where it all started, and that fast food restaurant parking lot, where it would all end. Twenty-five years is a lifetime of defeat, struggle, and progress. <br><br>
Twenty-five years ago, Vincent Chin was murdered. What had started out as a joyous evening with friends, a bachelor party for the soon-to-be-married Chin, would tragically turn into a night of despair. Twenty-five years ago, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz, two white automobile workers in Detroit’s stagnating automobile industry, beat an unarmed man to death with a baseball bat. <br><br>
Chin, a 27-year old Chinese American, was killed because his murderers thought he was Japanese.
Undoubtedly, that’s an oversimplification, and we may never know the exact details of what happened that night. But from what eyewitnesses of the event have claimed, from what the economic and social context of the period tells us, the racial motivation for Chin’s death is almost undeniable. This was a hate crime. <br><br>
In the words of Ebens, “It’s because of you motherfuckers that we’re out of work.” <br><br>
The killing of Vincent Chin was not an isolated incident, it did not occur within a vacuum. Before his death, the automobile industry in America was facing stiff competition from various Japanese auto companies. The entire nation was hit hard by the automobile industry’s impending collapse, and Detroit was no exception. The city, where an immense number of residents were employed in car manufacturing, was in recession. <br><br>
The natural scapegoat, of course, was Japan and their booming automobile industry. Promoted by local politicians and union leaders, supported by both employed and unemployed, anti-Japanese sentiment skyrocketed. Never mind that American car manufacturers had gone years without responding to calls to develop more fuel-efficient automobiles. Never mind that the U.S. as a whole had stood by and witnessed the death of the working class since McCarthyism. The blame must be put on those crafty Japanese. <br><br>
Hence the hateful statements vocalized by Chin’s murderers as they barraged him with their Louisville Slugger. The motions of a sledgehammer to the hood of a Honda are not unlike those of a bat to the face of a man mistaken as Japanese but undoubtedly understood as enemy. <br><br>
Those same motions are echoed in the banging of the judge’s gavel, as the killers’ sentence is proclaimed: guilty of manslaughter, three years probation, and a $3,780 fine. In the words of the judge, “These weren’t the kind of men you send to jail.” <br><br>
It did not take twenty-five years for Asian Americans to recognize what had happened here: two white men who had admitted to killing a defenseless man had just gotten away with murder. The judge had in effect legalized murdering Asians. Asian Americans across the country saw Chin’s death as an indication that ethnic distinctions of the past would not be the avenue to challenge the strand of racism that groups together and essentializes all Asians. <br><br>
And so a pan-Asian American identity was forged. The creation of American Citizens for Justice, founded by Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Pilipinos living in the Detroit area, was the first step, and the group began organizing rallies and pursuing other legal avenues to gain justice. The movement spread across the nation and demonstrations in many major cities composed of an array of different Asian ethnic groups showcased the widespread support for bringing the killers to trial. Under immense pressure, the US Department of Justice filed charges in 1983 against Ebens and Nitz for violating Chin’s civil rights and conspiracy. <br><br>
Still, the two men walked away without having set foot in a prison. An initial conviction was overturned in a federal appeals court due to evidence that the prosecution had been improperly coaching witnesses. The case was retried, but both men were found not guilty on all charges. A civil suit against Ronald Ebens resulted in $1.5 million in damages, but the money was never paid; Ebens fled the state. <br><br>
But the movement for justice did not end there. The organizations that had grown out of the Chin case continued their work, expanding their vision to include advocacy for other Asian American groups. The mode of coalition building we see today is a direct product of that which came out of Chin’s death. <br><br>
At times, I’ve wondered why it is that twenty-five years from Chin’s death, we still rally around him, lightning to the rod. The best answer I can come up with is this: <br>
That the sound of a bat against bone is not muted by flesh. <br>
That no noise can penetrate the sobs of Lily Chin, as the men who killed her only child, the kind of men you don’t send to jail, get away with three years probation and a $3,780 slap on the wrist. <br>
That in times of injustice, injustice of any and every degree, silence is a privilege we are not afforded, nor should it ever be. <br><br>
You see, no matter how much we have come in these twenty-five years, we haven’t come far enough. Not even close to it. We still see Vincent Chin. Everyday, everywhere. The picture of Vincent stays in our memory, that sense of self-assuredness, the gold chain, everything about his hair and clothing that screams 1980s fashion miscues, the smile. The image is so easily recalled. <br><br>
We see Vincent Chin in the “Dotbuster” attacks against Asian Indians in the late 1980s in Jersey City. We see Vincent in the Southeast Asian refugee children mowed down by a crazed man with a semiautomatic rifle. We see him in the female workers toiling in the sweatshops of Nike and Jessica McClintock, both here and abroad; in the meth addicts shunned by the Bay Area Chinese and Pilipino community, as well as in American society in general; in the unseen women brought to this country through trickery or coercion to serve as sex slaves in invisible parlors, unsure of when (or if) they will ever escape; in the soon-to-be-deported Southeast Asian adults, who as teenagers committed crimes in the indiscretions
of youth and now face the draconian laws of a xenophobic backlash against the immigrant communities. Violence is not relegated only to the physical, but extends to all acts of animosity and oppression, individual and structural. <br><br>
And that is why it is crucial for us to remember Vincent Chin. For when we recall that image of Vincent in his youth, we are also reminded of the protests and rallies by the Asian American community in the wake of his death. We are reminded of a united cry for justice, a voice that, while not easily nor automatically created, said to the rest of America that we would not tolerate such violence to go unchallenged. <br><br>
But it is not enough that we rally around those sites of marginalization and violence as they pertain to the Asian American community. We must also be always aware that Vincent Chin, though racialized as Asian, can be found in the struggles of all oppressed peoples. Vincent Chin is the murder of a black man shot 41 times by New York’s Finest, who mistook his move towards reaching for his wallet as a move for the gun that all black men must invariably carry. Vincent Chin is the murder of the Mexican teenager living in Texas, fatally shot in the back by a white rancher who mistook the American-born youth as an illegal immigrant, as any rational person could be prone to do. <br><br>
And so as we had fought for Vincent Chin, as we continue to fight against anti-Asian racism, we must also fight against any and all instances of marginalization. The next step is not a movement beyond Asian American issues, but an expansion of our vision to include issues that affect all people of color, all persecuted groups, and all humans. <br><br>
Twenty-five years ago, Vincent Chin died. Twenty-five years later, we are here where he is not. But while time separates us, while Detroit is miles away from Berkeley, we are not abdicated from our responsibility, our duty to fight against the injustice that existed then and there, the injustice that exists now and here. We must fight so Vincent Chin can rest in peace, so that we can rest in peace. <br><br>
