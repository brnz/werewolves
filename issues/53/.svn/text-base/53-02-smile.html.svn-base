<p>It&#146;s Saturday, February 23, and the prospective mentors for Project S.M.I.L.E. 
  have lost their smiles. They are not mad, sad or discouraged about anything, 
  but instead, are in the middle of their mentor retreat, where the reality of 
  what they will experience in the upcoming semester stares them in the face. 
  The S.M.I.L.E. staff continues to carefully instill an understanding that change 
  does not instantaneously appear in mentees and that teamwork is a crucial in 
  making a difference. The mentors are told that when they understand that, they 
  can fully reap the rewards of being a mentor. Smiles return. </p>
<p>Established in 1999 as a division of UC Berkeley&#146;s Asian American Association, 
  Project S.M.I.L.E. is one of the more unique mentoring programs on campus. S.M.I.L.E., 
  which stands for Spreading Multiculturalism and Inspiring Leadership through 
  Education, started at Longfellow Middle School in Berkeley with a challenging 
  mission &#150; to provide a thorough, cross-cultural experience by having its 
  members, primarily Asian American college students, tutor and mentor mostly 
  African American, and Latino youths, most of whom are African American or Latino. 
  The goal of the program is to provide a two-way learning process: for as the 
  students learn from the mentors, the mentors also learn from the students. Though 
  S.M.I.L.E. began small, it quickly grew into the largest after school mentoring 
  program in the Berkeley Unified School District. </p>
<p>The greatest task Project S.M.I.L.E. faces is stressing the differences between 
  a tutor and a mentor. For the most part, a tutor&#146;s responsibility involves 
  assisting a student academically. Tutors are generally given the freedom to 
  work with multiple students, giving whatever is required from day to day. Lastly, 
  the call of duty for a tutor seldom extends outside of the classroom, as it 
  is not necessarily a part of the work. </p>
<p>A lot more is demanded of mentors, S.M.I.L.E.&#146;s specialty. They carry 
  the responsibility of being a tutor, role model and friend to their mentees. 
  Each mentor is given one student to look after for at least one semester. All 
  mentors are expected to visit their mentees at least two days a week since the 
  bonding process requires time on both sides. However, mentors are expected to 
  not only tutor the kids, but to spend time with them outside of class. For some, 
  this includes hanging out on Telegraph or around campus, while for others, it 
  involves just talking on the phone or listening to middle school gossip. Regardless, 
  the emphasis is put on giving the kids quality time in a large quantity. S.M.I.L.E. 
  also arranges events for kids on the weekends, including barbeques, a shadow 
  day, a talent show, and ultimately, a trip to Six Flags Marine World. Thus, 
  through a blend of leadership, diversity, education and sense of community, 
  Project S.M.I.L.E. pushes the envelope of improving the lives of its mentors 
  and mentees, alike. Ensuring the effectiveness of the mentoring process, mentors 
  and mentees are paired through an interview process and surveys, through which 
  common personalities and interests are matched by the program&#146;s coordinators. 
  To prepare the mentors for the upcoming semester and build the teamwork between 
  them, SMILE arranges a several retreats and trainings. </p>
<p>That Saturday, the new crop of Project S.M.I.L.E. mentors&#150; still at the 
  first training &#150; prepares for the tasks for the semester. They know that 
  under the requirements of hard work and dedication is a reward of personal fulfillment 
  and growth. And while there are no corny guarantees of success or white lies 
  of a Cinderella story for the new mentors, in the business of making smiles, 
  every mentor inevitably succeeds. </p> </td>
