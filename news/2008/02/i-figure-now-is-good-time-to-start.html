They do a damn good job of flyering,  posting, and tabling. Even if you didn’t want to notice them on campus,  you can’t help yourself because they are just too damn vigilant. Anyway,  down to the nitty gritty. Having been at Cal since 2004, I am never  surprised when AAA has their first general meeting of the semester where  they make a spoof out of some movie or TV show. </span><br /></p> <p><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >But, this time, I was caught  off guard: “TRANSFORMERS – Asians in Disguise!” Excuse me if I  just don’t get it, especially when I see a figure of a Transformer  next to a guy, who presumably is supposed to be some kind of Asian,  with a rickshaw. To top it off, he’s wearing one of those rice field  straw hats. </span><br /></p> <p><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >Thanks to Facebook, I’ve  got the JPEG of that flyer for you, as I am sure a picture is worth  a thousand words.</span><br /></p> <p><a name="0.1_graphic02"></a><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  ><img src="http://mail.google.com/mail/?name=3da753a33a89d1ca.jpg&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=vahi&amp;view=att&amp;th=117b976a14b76a9c" alt="Your browser may not support display of this image." height="444" width="576" /></span></p> <p><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >Now, what’s wrong with this  picture? What does “Asians in disguise” really mean? Why did they  use this graphic of a man in a rickshaw to equate “Asian?” Why is  my blood pressure slowly escalating?</span><br /></p> <p><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >I’ve heard around town that  the AAA Issues Committee is actually not that bad. So I’m wondering  two things: Do I not get the joke or does the Issues Committee really  suck? Considering that AAA has a past history of making spoofs on pop  culture icons, I’m not too surprised. If this is supposed to be funny,  I’m missing the point and I imagine so are a lot of other people that  are and aren’t Asian American. People, if you want to be ironic or  make a spoof of something, at least try to make it funny on paper.</span><br /></p> <p><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >Now, I have yet to see this  actual skit since it’s not happening until Monday.
