<p>As images of API men have fluctuated throughout American history from sexually 
  predatory Fu Manchus to kung fu fighters, the Asian male currently seems to 
  be desexualized in American mass media. I was curious to find out what my seemingly 
  asexual Asian brothers and sisters thought about this; what do API men themselves 
  think about how they&#146;re portrayed in American mass media?</p>

<p><b>How do you think API men are portrayed in the mass media?</b></p>
<p><b>John:</b> Hoods, brains and martial artists. Fellow friends who act seem 
  to constantly remind me that they are stereotyped into these molds. </p>

<p><b>Alice:</b> In general, the dominant images of API men are as coolies (low-level, 
  simple minded worker bees), sexless nerds/socially inept clowns (Sixteen Candles, 
  Breakfast at Tiffany&#146;s), gangsters/pimps (Year of the Dragon, Chinatown, 
  Lethal Weapon, Miss Saigon), kung-fu experts, ancient wise gurus, and more recently, 
  ineffectual/tightwad boyfriends/husbands (Joy Luck Club) and cold authoritarian 
  fathers (Anna and the King). Not to mention the vast array of personality-less 
  laundry workers, grocery store owners, delivery boys and waiters. They date 
  or are married to women (sometimes Asian, sometimes not) who eventually need 
  to be rescued by white men.</p>
<p><b>Kerry:</b> When you look at movies there are no portrayals of API men in 
  the mass media. Jackie Chan, Russell Wong, BD Wong, Chow Yun Fat, Jet Li. That 
  there are API actors doesn&#146;t mean that API men are represented in any coherent 
  way in film. Portrayals of API men probably come more through the news. API 
  men are like Jerry Yang, who made his first million by the age of 25. API men 
  are the model minority, good students, engineers and professionals. There is 
  little to no sexuality attributed to API men in the media.</p>
<p><b>Can you think of &#147;hot&#148; API male figures? Are they objects of sexual 
  desire?</b></p>
<p><b>Kerry:</b> Well, obviously not. Dean Cain? Keanu Reeves? They&#146;re hapa, 
  so do they count? I don&#146;t think so. They don&#146;t go around proclaiming 
  their cultural heritage and their hotness is strictly defined from an American 
  perspective. Jet Li can be pretty hot sometimes, also Chow Yun Fat, but I don&#146;t 
  think they are allowed to be sexualized in any way in the movies that they are 
  in. Refer to infamous hug scene between Jet Li and Aaliyah.</p>
<p><b>Do they ever have sex?</b></p>
<p><b>Pei:</b> No&#133;they don&#146;t. They never get the girl. Jackie Chan? 
  No. Chow Yun Fat? No. Jet Li? No. They don&#146;t get any. Now that I think 
  about it every other bad ass hero get the girl and the Asian guys don&#146;t. 
  . .. They don&#146;t get any. Damn.</p>
<p><b>What do you think about the accuracy of these portrayals?</b></p>
<p><b>John:</b> I don&#146;t think it&#146;s an accurate portrayal, but any exposure 
  for now is good. It may take much more time, money and able visionaries to get 
  API men to be portrayed differently in the mass media.</p>
<p><b>Do you think that the Asian men that are in the media are typified and in 
  niche roles? Can they ever be portrayed as normal people separate and apart 
  from being martial artists and computer nerds?</b></p>
<p><b>Chong:</b> I think right now it&#146;s definitely a niche market because 
  I think going back to the way Asians were oppressed when they first came to 
  America&#133;that&#146;s eventually how we made a living. We found a niche, 
  for example in building railroads, farming and things of that sort. So it goes 
  back to that Asians never fit in naturally with history.</p>
<p><b>Peter:</b> I think there&#146;s definitely two sides of the street. One 
  is I don&#146;t think the media is out there to really put Asians out there. 
  So in that sense, yeah, I think the media gives Asians a difficult opportunity 
  to do what they want to do. At the same time I know that one time I was talking 
  to this casting agent and he said you know what you don&#146;t see many Asians 
  coming out here trying to be models and actors and stuff. To a certain extent 
  they&#146;re just working with what they&#146;re given and when they do see 
  a few Asian people, hey then we just kind of have to fit them in wherever you 
  think they fit in. </p>
<p><b>Do you find the representation of API males to be problematic, does it bother 
  you?</b></p>
<p><b>Pei:</b> I don&#146;t care. Yeah, for the most part it&#146;s misrepresented. 
  But I personally don&#146;t care what 99.9 percent of America thinks anyway. 
  I haven&#146;t run into a problem where someone on the street was like &#147;Hey, 
  show me some martial arts.&#148;</p>
<p><b>To what extent do you think API men get to control how they&#146;re seen, 
  taken or interpreted?</b></p>
<p><b>Jeff:</b> I think it&#146;s something we have to work on but I don&#146;t 
  see it as a critical problem right now. I think it&#146;s something that needs 
  to develop slowly, but one step at a time, right?</p>
<p><b>Peter:</b> Yeah, because when it comes down to it, it sounds stupid, but 
  people believe everything they see on TV so when they hear these stupid jokes 
  either they feel they can get away with it which pisses me off, they feel like 
  that&#146;s really we&#146;re like, which obviously isn&#146;t true. And given 
  that there are some certain qualities that are true, but to carry it out and 
  to constantly perpetuate that, it constantly ingrains into the American mindset, 
  this is what Asian people are like and just accept it. And Asian people just 
  kind of sit around and take it up the ass too, they just say, okay that&#146;s 
  funny, hahah or that&#146;s terrible, but don&#146;t really do anything about 
  it.</p>
<p>Media definitely influences the way we as a culture act. So I would say that 
  it is a serious issue. To see that stuff and pass it off as oh, no one takes 
  it seriously. First of all that&#146;s bullshit because I think that everyone 
  to a certain extent starts carrying that certain mindset. You see it enough 
  times, and you&#146;re going to start believing it to a certain extent whether 
  it&#146;s subconscious or its conscious. Now, if you&#146;re totally secure 
  about yourself, that&#146;s great but it&#146;s still pretty selfish. You&#146;re 
  out there representing a community and you&#146;re part of that community and 
  you have to be ready to take action and to just say, well, it&#146;s not affecting 
  me&#133;I think that&#146;s one of the main problems within the Asian community, 
  it&#146;s not affecting me, therefore why should I even really bother.</p>
<p><b>Do you think that Asian men need to be exoticized when they&#146;re presented 
  in media (is it similar to the way that Asian women are exoticized)?</b></p>
<p><b>Kerry:</b> In the gay community, API men are exoticized. Is it possible 
  that at any time that Asians become the object of desire by white people, because 
  they are &#147;different&#148; they are immediately exoticized? Gay Asian men 
  are sexualized in a way that straight Asian men aren&#146;t. There&#146;s a 
  whole concomitant gay Asian pornography culture that fosters the sexualization 
  of gay Asian men. &#133;the only way that Asian men will be sexualized is if 
  the possibility of it is portrayed in the media. There is such a lack of sexualized 
  Asian men in the media that it almost makes me think that it might be a threat 
  to dominant white male heterosexual culture to have Asian men be sexual.</p>
<p><b>What do you think of the model minority myth and how it intersects with 
  sexual desirability and dateability?</b></p>
<p><b>Alice:</b> I don&#146;t think the model minority myth makes API men sexy. 
  However, it may make API men appeal to non-API potential mates who are turned 
  off by the machismo associated with other men. As in &#147;there are the men 
  you want to marry and the men you want to fuck.&#148; Perhaps API men are finding 
  a niche in the &#147;men you want to marry category&#148; as they purportedly 
  provide stable financial support and are loyal like lap dogs. And you know the 
  women won&#146;t be beating a path into their pants.</p>
<p><b>Do you think things like beefcake calendars with Asian men are viable ways 
  for them to reclaim or define their sexuality? </b></p>
<p><b>Kerry:</b> Yes, that Asian men can by portrayed as objects of desire in 
  the same manner that white men can is the way to sidestep exotification, at 
  least in their representation. What people do with these images in their minds 
  is the more intractable business. There is a hesitancy within the Asian community 
  to sexualize their men in the first place. Asian countries are immensely sexually 
  repressed. Maybe that sexual repression needs to be figured out before we can 
  find suitable sexualized images of men in the Asian community.</p>
<p><b>What about the angry Asian male who&#146;s upset that everyone&#146;s taking 
  away his women.</b></p>
<p><b>Peter:</b> I&#146;ve definitely said that before in joking but partially 
  in truth because it boils down ultimately to male insecurity because we&#146;re 
  Asian men. Partly just because hey we&#146;re guys and we&#146;re insecure but 
  also because as an Asian male you almost feel like, alright look, you see the 
  Hispanic guys, they&#146;ve got the whole Latin lover thing going on so they&#146;re 
  going to attract whoever they want. The black guys, they&#146;ve got their whole 
  cool thing going on, the trendsetter, whatever they&#146;ve got going for them. 
  Asian males don&#146;t seem to have as much going for them, well at least in 
  our perspective when we start to compare ourselves. And then the white guys, 
  well they just all got it going on because they&#146;re just white guys. And 
  when you see that you can&#146;t even get the Asian women, it&#146;s like, &#147;ok, 
  what the fuck is going on.&#148; And then, insecurity breeds anger and hatred. 
  And all the sudden you start turning the tables, it&#146;s like, wait there&#146;s 
  nothing wrong with me, it&#146;s everything with her what&#146;s going on with 
  her, what&#146;s gotten into her mind and then I think all the sudden things 
  start turning 180. Is it popular, yeah, but I think that that kind of mentality, 
  it&#146;s in every race, like blacks, Latinos, it&#146;s just a whatever thing. 
  It transcends race; it&#146;s just a personal insecurity thing.<br>
