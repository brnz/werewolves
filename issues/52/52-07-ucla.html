<p>In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the US has turned its eyes and 
  bombs towards Afghanistan, while &#145;patriots&#146; at home have curiously 
  taken out their frustrations on Sikhs, whose turbans linked them to Osama bin 
  Laden and made them distinct victims of the backlash. Much has since been said 
  about how Sikhism actually originated in Northern India, has no connection to 
  Afghanistan, and is a religion entirely distinct from Islam. Nonetheless, this 
  confusion reflects a collective ignorance about South Asia, and has further 
  energized UCLA students in their struggle for a South Asian studies program 
  on their campus. </p>
<p>What does it take for a geographic region to warrant an academic program at 
  a university? Is it enough that one out of every six people in the world lives 
  there? These are the questions asked by the students who, concerned about the 
  lack of South Asian classes offered at the university, established the South 
  Asian Studies Task Force in the Winter Quarter 2001.</p>
<p>Having petitioned university administrators with their demands, the students 
  decry the lack of consistently offered courses and explain in the mission statement 
  of the organization that &#147;the extent of courses offered does not do justice 
  to the wealth of potential studies in the region of South Asia.&#148; </p>
<p>In addition to the approximately 1,000 South Asian students at UCLA, the growing 
  presence of over 200,000 South Asians in the Los Angeles area emphasizes the 
  absurdity of the current situation at UCLA in which there exists no undergraduate 
  minor, major, or graduate program of study for the subcontinent.</p>
<p>By demanding a relevant education, South Asian students are resisting the marginalization 
  of South Asians in all academic disciplines. Students add that even the Asian 
  American studies curriculum tends to focus on East Asian Americans &#151; a 
  critique that has often been waged against the Asian American studies program 
  at UC-Berkeley as well.</p>
<p>Specifically, the task force is urging the university to grant tenure and hire 
  more South Asian studies professors. As the students explain, &#147;an investment 
  in South Asian studies is an investment to the commitment to diversity and research 
  at UCLA.&#148; The university&#146;s response to the demands has been characterized 
  as &#147;ambiguous&#148; with no tangible commitment to the program.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of the campaign to defend Ethnic Studies at UC-Berkeley in Spring 
  1999, the students agitating for the creation of South Asian studies at UCLA 
  understand that the issues go beyond the creation and maintenance of one program. 
  Instead, they place their struggle in the larger context of exercising student 
  voice and demanding institutional accountability in the educational process.</p>
