<p>The 2000 Census verified that San Francisco&#146;s 12th State Assembly District 
  has the most Asian Americans in California. But whether this will give Asian 
  Americans any more political power is debatable as new district lines are being 
  drawn in the Bay Area. </p>
<p>Currently, the state legislature is reallocating California&#146;s 33 million 
  person population into 80 assembly districts based on the new census. Because 
  California&#146;s overall population has grown at a higher rate than SF&#146;s, 
  the city&#146;s two districts have to add populations from beyond its limits-- 
  thus creating the possibility for a district with the highest Asian American 
  population in the state. However, with the drawing of new district lines, this 
  was far from true. The lines dilute Asian American political power by splitting 
  the APA community into two different districts. Ideally, the Asian community 
  would be kept together in one district, thereby increasing their legitimacy 
  and their influence in the state legislature. Issues like immigration rights, 
  affirmative action and bilingual education are not strictly Asian American issues, 
  but with a majority ethnic population in a district, the person representing 
  that district would better serve these interests. Redrawing district lines forms 
  the political landscape for the next 10 years, which is why it is so important 
  that it reflects the communities it encompasses.</p>
<p>The recent redrawing of district lines in California has had a political impact 
  on not only Asian Americans, but also gays in the Castro district and Latinos 
  in Southern California, who have all been again marginalized by the redrawing 
  of district lines that cuts across their communities.</p>
<p>Reapportionment, the re-drawing of legislative district lines occurs, every 
  ten years after the census reveals changes in populations, and has historically 
  been manipulated by legislators and those in power to divide and conquer minority 
  populations. In order to protect the current political establishment of San 
  Francisco and Santa Clara County Asian populations were divided up so that their 
  impact would be lessened.</p>
<p>San Francisco, which has an Asian population of 31 percent, is divided between 
  two newly redrawn districts -- the 12th and 13th district. The 12th district 
  reaches into the western half and three-quarters of the southern parts of San 
  Francisco, the heavily Asian American neighborhoods such as the Richmond, Sunset, 
  Excelsior and Visitacion Valley. The number of Asians in the 12th district is 
  increased significantly by the inclusion of half of Daly City, which itself 
  is 50 percent Asian. The 13th Assembly District, which takes in the western 
  half of SF and half of Daly City is 42 percent Asian. By dividing SF and Daly 
  City, the new districts weaken the influence of Asian voters in San Francisco.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Daly City residents of the 12th District are practically 
  disenfranchised politically because whoever will represent the district will 
  most likely come from SF and be more concerned with SF issues. Thus, for the 
  considerable APA population in Daly City, they won&#146;t have the political 
  influence they deserve.</p>
<p>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 plays an important role in the apportionment 
  of representation. The Voting Rights Act guarantees one person one vote and 
  maximizes equal representation. It protects against the dilution of minority 
  votes and protects &#147;communities of interests.&#148; Although not required 
  by law to create a district in which a recognized minority or combination of 
  minorities is in the majority, lawmakers must give consideration to the concentration 
  of minority populations when drawing the lines. </p>
<p>Each jurisdiction will be required to prove to the U.S. Department of Justice 
  that the proposed reapportionment plan does not worsen the positions of minority 
  voters in comparison to that political subdivision&#146;s most recently-approved 
  districting plan. For example, reapportionment plans are prohibited from dividing 
  up a geographically situated minority population into different districts in 
  order to minimize their voting strength in any one district. Conversely, it 
  is also illegal to draw a majority of a county&#146;s minority population into 
  a single district in order to minimize their opportunity to hold multiple seats 
  on the governing board.</p>
<p>Not only would the ideal district map not reduce the voting strength of any 
  minority or combination of minorities, but it would facilitate the election 
  of minority representation where the opportunity for such facilitation exists. 
  But in light of what has recently happened in SF, that is not likely to occur 
  any time soon. Reapportionment, when still used as a tool for the few and elite 
  to maintain the status quo, has long term consequences for minority communities 
  to get their issues heard and advocated at the legislative level.</p>
<p>The census figures are used for the reapportionment and redistricting process 
  that determines representation in Washington. These figures are also used to 
  determine whether that representation is adequate -- if the representation is 
  reflective of the diversity of people who live in that state and in that newly 
  cut congressional district. Its important to make sure that the districts are 
  cut in a way that&#146;s consistent with the people who live there. The 2000 
  Census puts SF&#146;s population at 776,000 and San Mateo County&#146;s is 707,000. 
  San Mateo County currently has 43.5 % Asian American, while non-Latino whites 
  went from 49.8% of the district to 36.3%. Each of the state&#146;s 80 Assembly 
  districts should have about 423,000 people. Yet, SF ended up as the dominant 
  portion of two Assembly districts, at the expense of surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Census statistics are used for the allocation of programmatic dollars -- everything 
  from education and health care to transportation, which is why there was such 
  a push by community organizations to get an accurate Census report. In 1990, 
  dozens of communities, ethnic minorities and lower income communities, lost 
  out on millions of federal funding due to inaccurate counting by the Census 
  bureau. But now, after the 2000 Census, it looks as if some of these same communities 
  will lose out again, this time in the dilution of their political voice in state 
  government.<br>
