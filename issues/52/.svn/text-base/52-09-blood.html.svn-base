<p>On Thursday, October 4th, over 200 workers and community supporters gathered 
  at a picket line in front of the San Francisco State Building to urge California 
  Labor Commissioner Arthur Lujan to enforce California&#146;s garment industry 
  law. The action, organized by Sweatshop Watch, a coalition of labor, community, 
  civil rights, immigrant rights, women&#146;s, religious &amp; student organizations, 
  and individuals committed to eliminating sweatshop conditions in the global 
  garment industry, had three specific goals: ensure that garment workers at the 
  Wins garment factories are paid their back wages as quickly as possible and 
  that the manufacturers and retailers are held responsible, fully enforce laws 
  to protect the rights of low wage immigrant workers, and create economic development 
  programs to help low wage immigrant workers transition to living wage jobs. 
</p>
<p>Toha &#147;Jimmy&#148; Quan and Anna Wong own three garment factories in San 
  Francisco: Wins Fashions, Inc., Wins of California, Inc., and Wins Industries 
  of America, Inc. One factory declared bankruptcy in the summer of 2001, the 
  other two were unregistered factories that were shut down in August 2001 by 
  the US Department of Labor. These factories also have a long history of labor 
  law violations. In the early 1990s, Wins signed a consent decree with the U.S. 
  Department of Labor due to repeated law violations leading them to be on a DOL 
  &#147;target&#148; list for frequent inspections. Former employees, represented 
  by the Asian Law Caucus, have already sued Wins factories twice for labor law 
  violations. Most recently it has been speculated that various Wins factories 
  may still be in operation despite a violation of court orders. Nikki Bas, director 
  of Sweatshop Watch says it is &#147;incredibly frustrating to know that the 
  state and federal labor departments know that they&#146;re producing and won&#146;t 
  or can&#146;t do anything to stop it.&#148;</p>
<p>Almost 200 employees, mainly monolingual Chinese immigrant women were employed 
  at these three Wins garment factories until they were closed. The factories 
  owe over $850,000 in unpaid wages to these employees that date back from March 
  and April of 2001. These workers allegedly sewed for such labels as: J.C. Penny, 
  Kmart, Sears, Wal-Mart, Tommy Hilfiger, Bebe, the Gap, Sam&#146;s Club, U.S. 
  Army and Airforce, Cut Loose, and Jolene (a label owned by factory owners Quan 
  and Wong). 190 workers have filed for individual claims for back wages with 
  the California Labor Commissioner.</p>
<p>The successful rally encouraged Wins garment workers to take action against 
  their former employer to demand their wages. On Tuesday, October 9th, workers 
  organized a march between Wins Fashion, Inc. on Folsom Street to Wins of California, 
  Inc. on Lansing Street. At the meeting time, the workers and community supporters 
  were confronted by Anna Wong, Wins factory owner, who handed out literature 
  that blamed the Department of Labor for the workers not being paid. Using various 
  charts and graphs, Wong insisted that the Department of Labor already had money 
  set aside from Wong in a &#147;lock-box&#148; that would pay the workers, and 
  was persistent that she did not operate a sweatshop. She encouraged people to 
  enter into the office to check the validity of her financial records and the 
  timecards of the workers. Wong claims she only owes back wages that amount to 
  no more than $200,000. However, it is important to distinguish that Wong still 
  has not paid adequate money into the Department of Labor &#147;lock-box&#148;, 
  and many of the workers signed timesheets because of Anna Wong&#146;s physical 
  and emotional harassment. For example, workers were forced to sign documents 
  written in English saying they had been paid while there was no available Chinese 
  translation for the monolingual workers. Wong tried to convince the workers 
  and supporters not to proceed with the action. However, workers and supporters 
  began to form a line in front of the factory and started chanting in Chinese.</p>
<p>The workers began to become empowered through this action. They started arguing 
  with Anna, one worker proudly held up a homemade sign that said &#147;Anna Wong 
  Owes me Blood Money.&#148; They then took to the streets of San Francisco, stopping 
  traffic and demanding their wages. Upon arriving at the other factory, the marchers 
  were welcomed once again by Anna Wong. Yet it was obvious by the wrap-up of 
  the march that the workers were stronger and determined to get their due wages. 
  After the march and rally, the workers went to the Union of Needletrades, Industrial 
  and Textile Employees&#146; (UNITE) hall where several bilingual staff from 
  the Division of Labor and Standards Enforcement (DLSE) reviewed their wage claim 
  forms and made appointments to start processing their wage claims.</p>
<p>The wage claims process is extremely long and difficult, especially because 
  there are not enough staff in the DLSE to accommodate all of the people not 
  being paid their wages in California. &#147;The companies using this factory 
  should have done a much better job of monitoring,&#148; says Bas. There must 
  be some responsibility on the labels that the Wins garment workers sewed for 
  because those labels are the ones that hired Anna Wong as a subcontractor. The 
  workers continue to assess what kinds of action they want to take to seek justice.
