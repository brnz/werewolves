What Might Have Been <br>
The Virginia Tech Shootings <br><br>

by kevin lee <br><br>

I feel like I know Seung-Hui Cho. <br><br>
In that mugshot slapped on publications nationwide is a young Asian American student, bespectacled, morose, downtrodden. His somber eyes and tightly-pursed lips convey constant, everlasting tension. He has trouble relating to others. He’s angry at the world. He views writing as cathartic. <br><br>
I keep looking and looking at the photo, and one truly sobering thought pushes its way into the forefront of my mind: Seung-Hui Cho is some twisted reflection of myself. <br><br>
I’m not Cho. My hands remain untainted by the blood of thirty-three people. The collective sorrow and fury of mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers do not burden my conscience. Depression will not threaten my overall well-being. But just like anyone else, I have my ups-and-downs, I have my moments of anger, my flashes of rage. I sense that somewhere, deep in the recesses of our souls, Cho and I hold some of the same ideas about the world, about social disconnection, about estrangement and ignorance even in places that aim to foster growth and thought. Any individual would have trouble making sense of such complex dynamics. <br><br>
Understand that the killer does not deserve our immediate and unconditional sympathy. Such a forgiving reaction would completely eclipse the grotesque and cold-hearted nature of his acts. It is impossible to comprehend what feelings currently grip the victims’ family and friends. But for those who would respond with ignorant, angered rants against the killer, consider the fact that something was going on with Cho, some truly tumultuous combination of his own deeply-brewed animosity and his own misunderstandings of a rigorous, social environment.<br><br>
It angers me that people would callously strike out at Cho. I looked on Facebook to garner background information on the accused killer of at least thirty-three people at Virginia Tech. Sympathies were mutually shared amongst all college students: “Today we are all Hokies” Beyond this, all I see are student groups devoted to Cho, with student responses using such vitriolic rhetoric as “douchebag,” and “pussy” to describe the troubled student. Wall posts filled with such hardheaded, electronic chicken-scratch. <br><br>
Do people, especially hormone-happy males, really think calling Cho a “pussy” really aids the situation? Such shortsighted notions may provide temporary personal release, but does nothing to add to the discourse on why this particular tragedy occurred or how to prevent future tragedies from occurring. Using such chauvinistic, weakness-laden rhetoric reveals supremely ignorant attitudes towards an act riddled with social and psychological complexities. I do not feign that I understand Cho’s actions; I simply find it horribly ironic that these electronic lamenters use such disempowering terms to describe what the killer believed to be an empowering act. Classifying Cho as a “pussy” essentially equates him to a coward, and funnels the discourse into a binaristic “good guy-bad guy” explanation. It’s not that simple. <br><br>
It is in the aftermath of such a tragedy that we need to find mutual understanding with others. Yet, an article published in The Nation highlights people who seem more focused on differences. Andrew Lam began his article “Let it be some other ‘Asian’” with this: “All across America, no doubt, non-Korean Asian-Americans are now heaving a sigh of relief.” Lam goes on to illustrate how people from various Asian American ethnicities, Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, and Pakistani Americans, all were hoping the killer did not share their ethnic background. <br><br>
When I first heard about the Virginia Tech shootings, the news devastated me. But then I heard on the KTVU 10 PM news that the alleged killer was supposedly a Chinese citizen visiting with a visa, and I doubled over, a strong hook to the soft spot of my gut. Chinese? Chinese? Like, me Chinese? That couldn’t be the case. Horrific incidents occur in America, murders, bombings, suicides, terrorist acts... but none of them involve Chinese people. Instigators are white, black, Latino, Middle Eastern... but not Chinese. Never Chinese. I wasn’t sure how to take this. <br><br>
When I heard that the press had jumped to conclusions, and that the person responsible was actually a Korean green-card holder, I expected myself to feel relieved, but found myself still feeling a deep, internal sense of dread. Part of me wanted to believe I felt this way because of the horrific nature of what Cho had done, but there was something else. I then realized what I was truly thinking: this was, in recent memory, the first American mass tragedy center around an EAST ASIAN individual. It didn’t matter that Cho wasn’t Chinese. If we are to indulge in the visual observations the mainstream press seemed so fond of, Cho was still Korean - not the dark-skinned, bearded turban-wearing “other” Asians that terrorize the world, but a pale-skinned, bespectacled, 40-plus-percent-of-Berkeley East Asian. I still felt a deep sense of fear, for I had never seen this before, and I did not know what to expect. <br><br>
Which leads to my frustration with the interviewees in Lam’s article. During the immediate hours after the story hit, I never said to anyone, “Please don’t let him be Chinese.” Even when I had doubled over in shock, I had come to the sad realization that somebody Chinese (Asian) had been responsible for this tragedy. What’s done is done. Whether or not he’s Chinese, there sure as hell is not a damn thing I or anyone else can do about it. The fact that the media identified the instigator as ASIAN (and not, say, Arab American or Muslim American or Hispanic or African American...but “Asian” as in “East Asian”) should be all the information needed. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Pacific Islander, regardless of the ethnic background Seung-Hui Cho may have had, we, the API community, are all affected. Is the South Korean community the only community tainted, branded from this act? Should Chinese Americans and Japanese Americans really breathe sighs of relief because Cho turned out to be Korean? <br><br>
The entire API community must prepare for any sort of racial/prejudicial backlash. It does nothing to help the Asian American community if, in this time of tragedy, we focus on differences. At this juncture, we must recognize pan-ethnic solidarity. If the numerous media outlets cannot bother to ensure the difference between a Chinese alien and a Korean resident in America for over a decade, then how can we expect anyone else to? Lam’s article notes a Chinese Virginia Tech student who was originally suspected of the shootings because of his Asian background, his affinity for guns, and the pictures of these guns he posted on his blog. Think anyone outside the API community truly distinguishes between Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese? In the chaotic hours after the shooting, the media did not. <br><br>
While progress has been made with respect to recognizing race and ethnicity, it would still be naive to think that people completely overlook ethnic differences. To expect the majority of America to distinguish between Iraqis, Afghanis, and Iranians, or Sunnis and Shiites is a stretch at best. Negative, unwarranted stereotypes are founded upon ignorance. Our nation’s history is built on an inability to distance itself from its affinity for racial prejudice. The Immigration Act of 1924 included an act called the Asian Exclusion Act which barred immigrants from all of Asia, inherently stating that Europeans are highly preferred entrants to Asians. As hb writer Brian Lau explains in this issue, the Vincent Chin tragedy still resonates in all of the API community, twenty-five years later. In the aftermath of 9/11, we somberly observe continued examples of racial profiling in places like Lodi, California, and in airports across the nation. If the Korean American community should receive unjustified backlash as a result of Blacksburg, the entire Asian Pacific Islander community must be prepared to stand together to weather the blows. <br><br>
Cho will in time become synonymous with McVeigh, Osama, Columbine. If we have learned anything from the past few weeks, we have learned that misconceptions rise in every medium, be it print, electronic, visual. The API community must unite and be prepared to deflect shortsighted, disempowering rhetoric and potentially dangerous prejudices. Scholars, journalists, students, Facebookers, Youtubers, and everyone inbetween will delve into Cho’s plays, view Cho’s videos, seek Cho’s past. In unearthing Cho’s history, they may discover what many within the API community already know: that Asian young people endure unique acclimation struggles here in America. New social customs, new behaviors, new values and expectations all weigh heavily on new arrivals and early-generation citizens alike. The API community, now more than ever, must take steps to ensure that people have the tools to adjust to a new land, be it social networks, job opportunities, or emotional support. With respect to the college environment, student groups act as a guiding light in a young person’s life, not only in fostering group solidarity and social skills, but also individual identity. As a community, we must strive to welcome all. <br><br>
I’m not Seung-Hui Cho. But if I didn’t have the family and friends that I am fortunate to have, the social activities that I partake in, the motivation that spurs me onward, I might have been. <br><br>
