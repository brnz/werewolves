    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext">Now 
        is the time. The government grows unashamed of its corpulence, the slumbering 
        unrest of the populous is relentlessly prodded. A new generation takes 
        on dusty mantles of liberty, indignation, uprising. In the face of detainment, 
        deportation, subjugation, and the final unveilings of an Orwellian machinery, 
        we raise cacophonous protest: march forth, citizens! <br>
        <br>
        But do we question the blinders we don in the name of momentum? <br>
        <br>
        Consider the Heinz Dilemma: &#8220;Heinz&#8217;s wife was near to death, 
        and her only hope was a drug that had been discovered by a pharmacist 
        who was selling it for an exorbitant price. The drug cost $200 to make, 
        and the pharmacist was selling it for $2000. Heinz could only raise $ 
        1000. He offered this to the druggist, and when his offer was rejected, 
        Heinz said he would pay the rest later. Still the druggist refused. In 
        desperation, Heinz considered stealing the drug. Would it be right for 
        him to do that?&#8221;<br>
        This situation was presented by the renowned psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg 
        to two eleven year old children. Jack mulled this over, and responded 
        thoughtfully, Heinz would be right to steal the drug, for human life is 
        surely worth more than money. Amy scrunched her forehead. It would not 
        be right for him to do that, she finally said. But it is wrong of the 
        druggist to charge so much. Surely, if he only knew the situation, he 
        would acquiesce. Surely, there was a way for the two men to negotiate, 
        a way to save the wife. <br>
        Kohlberg, the renowned psychologist, carefully noted observations, engaged 
        in great thought, and within the towering caverns of his Harvard office, 
        concluded little girls were moral imbeciles. <br>
        <br>
        Aside from the fumbling, blatant chauvinism of scientists of yore, much 
        can be said of these two approaches to the moral dilemma: our draw to 
        analyze in the terms of sweeping, universal principles (liberty, equality, 
        dead wives are weightier than pharmacists&#8217; pay checks) and to that 
        of personal engagement (dialogue, cooperation, negotiation). <br>
        These are not contrasting appeals. But they are different. We are bred 
        in an institution of theories, fervently moulding our eyes to recognize 
        the sublime, to claw the general from the burgeoning muck of disconnected 
        data. There is faith that we need not find patterns, they will emerge. 
        And we analyze, we quantify, we weigh: chaos before oppression, clamour 
        before silence, blood before disgrace. <br>
        <br>
        We like our principles thick and pulpy. <br>
        <br>
        But within that same mesh is the belief in dignity, the faith in the competence 
        of your fellow human creature. Within is respect. Somewhere behind five 
        syllable anti war posters, is complexity, a bigger story. <br>
        <br>
        It is easy to seduce ourselves with the rhetoric of revolution, become 
        overwhelmed at the arrangement of inequity, a dire line up of perverse 
        talk show guests. But we cannot always pay for the sweep of ages with 
        the weight of our everyday. We cannot demand peace and compassion in distant 
        lands, while we deftly gut each other on Sproul Plaza. <br>
        My spiel should not be confused for a hearty Fuck Principles, nor of hippie 
        namby-pambiness. I too take up the call against blatant wrong. But I entreat 
        my fellow revolutionaries to put down their blunt bludgeoners aimed at 
        jugulars. The call is for hammers and nails: weapons and tools. But above 
        all, for engagement with each other. I call for a hearty Fuck Blind Polarity. 
        <br>
        <br>
        So take these, the blistering pages of this soapbox, and of others. Feel 
        wronged, feel the weight, the imminent danger to civil liberties, to dignity, 
        to the very core resonance of human good. Then let us draw together, drop 
        blinders (or at least peek out occasionally), argue, listen, compromise. 
        And, in the spirit of the ego-maniacal fellow undergoing ethnic conversion 
        in the name of campus media domination, underline all with the shattering 
        force of irreverence (you fool, without All American Girl, you are nothing). 
        <br>
        Good God y&#8217;all.
