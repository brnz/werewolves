<p>For the Asian American conference fanatic, February 9 posed a difficult situation: 
  should she opt for the Bay Area Asian Pacific American Law Student Association 
  conference with the likes of Helen Zia and Angela Oh? Or should she attend the 
  Committee on Pilipino American Studies conference featuring Jessica Hagedorn? 
  Fortunately both conferences were held at UC Berkeley, giving the local APA 
  conference freak the chance to attend both.</p>
<p>Although organized by two separate bodies, APALSA and ComPASs drew on the same 
  theme the importance of connecting with the APA community at a basic level. 
  The students attending APALSA&#146;s second annual conference, clad in business 
  suits and ready to schmooze, were receptive to Helen Zia, the conference&#146;s 
  opening speaker.</p>

<p>Zia, who recently released the book My Country vs. Me with Wen Ho Lee, pointed 
  out the hand Asian American lawyers have had in landmark cases involving APAs, 
  such as the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, Japanese American internment reparations, 
  and the campaign finance scandal in the late 1990s. In these and other instances, 
  Zia said young lawyers were always behind the efforts, propelling the APA cause 
  into the national limelight. Equally importantly, Zia discussed the future of 
  the APA community and where APA lawyers fit in the picture.</p>
<p>&#147;We have reached a critical mass, where people like yourselves aren&#146;t 
  afraid to use your voices,&#148; Zia said. She then referred to one of the biggest 
  issues facing APAs today, racial profiling, emphasizing the roles that young 
  lawyers will have to fill. &#147;You, especially as lawyers, have your work 
  cut out for you.&#148;</p>
<p>In line with the conference&#146;s theme, &#147;Crossing Boundaries,&#148; 
  the list of speakers for the day included activist Yuri Kochiyama and lawyer 
  Angela Oh, who was appointed to the President Initiative on Race in 1997.</p>
<p>Across campus dozens of members of the Pilipino American community gathered 
  to discuss the status of Pilipino American Studies at every level of education. 
  &#147;On the Verge: Conversations on Pilipino American Studies&#148; was organized 
  by the Committee on Pilipino American Studies, a student group based at UC Berkeley 
  that is currently lobbying for a Pilipino American tenure-track professor.</p>
<p>Among the many speakers and attendees were Jessica Hagedorn, author of Dogeaters; 
  Leny Mendoza Strobel, a Pilipina professor at Sonoma State; and Dawn Mabalon, 
  who is currently teaching Pilipino American history at UC Berkeley. Also in 
  attendance were students and teachers from all levels of education and from 
  all over the state, including students from UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UCLA, 
  community organizers, artists, and Pilipino and non-Pilipino professors. One 
  of the conference&#146;s main accomplishments was simply providing a forum where 
  such a diverse group could meet to discuss a common concern.</p>
<p>Again, the importance of community connections was a hot topic of discussion, 
  especially between students. Most at the conference agreed that the issue of 
  Pilipino American Studies is important for all students. The problems are organizing 
  an effort that includes everyone and keeping up with different groups fighting 
  for a common cause.</p>
<p>&#147;We need to recognize the movements that are going on at other campuses,&#148; 
  said ComPASs organizer and panelist Dexter Ligot-Gordon.</p>
<p>The final panel focused mainly on the efforts at Berkeley, including the history 
  of ethnic studies and where Pilipino American Studies sits in the discipline. 
  It was during this portion of the conference when many of the attendees and 
  panelists spoke most passionately.</p>
<p>&#147;Frankly, the students at this university are tired of working. We shouldn&#146;t 
  have to sacrifice our time doing something the University should be doing for 
  us,&#148; said Karmela Herrera, a ComPASs organizer and panelist.</p>
<p>Her words did not go unheard; also in attendance were several high-profile 
  figures from UC Berkeley, including Ling-chi Wang and Elaine Kim from the Ethnic 
  Studies Department, and Dean of Social Sciences George Breslauer.</p>
<p>Whether or not ComPASs meets its goal of obtaining a position for a Pilipino 
  American Studies professor, the conference has surely launched the issue to 
  a more prominent place for discussion.</p> </td>
