<h3> about hb </h3>

    <p>



    hardboiled is a highly organized, take-no-prisoners, paramilitary journalistic juggernaut based at UC (United Corporation of) Berkeley. We live under self-imposed martial law to bring you the best in political rabblerousing, community muckraking, and pop culture machinations in the Bay Area and the world. We run a finely-honed machine that eats rusted nails for breakfast and lives and breathes information intelligence all day. And it has spit out this, the electronic version of hardboiled, to help restore the dignity of the web.

    </p>

    <p>

    We do this all for you.

    </p>

    <p>

    Please peruse these articles, as they aim to please. You will find on this site everything from underground films and music, to education reform, profiles of community leaders and APA athletes, to police brutality against Asian Americans, and even deconstructions of Asian pornography and a look into the world of Asian American zines and independent media.
