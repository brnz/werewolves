    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p>&#8220;From then on, 
        equipped with my limited intelligence, miniscule wisdom, and teenage angst, 
        I began to write little accounts of my daily thoughts via pad and pen&#8230;&#8221; 
        Student, friend, poet, mouth, and musician Paul Kim never fails to deliver 
        a show that gets the crowd roaring, clapping, hooting, and hollering. 
        The 19-year-old has cultivated an enthusiastic following across California 
        and beyond because he&#8217;s got what audiences want: confidence, flow, 
        rhyming styles, beat boxing skills, and the tenacity to speak on true, 
        down home subjects with in your face intensity. This UCLA student is set 
        to change the API spoken word scene one mic at a time.</p>
      <p><strong>Where did you grow up, and how did you get started in writing 
        and performing poetry?</strong><br>
        I grew up in Cypress, California, or Orange County, to get a little more 
        general &#8212; home of Disneyland, the Block, and other suburban amusements. 
        Small corporations seem to replace strawberry fields in my &#8216;hood. 
        I started writing in high school when I was introduced to a youth coffeehouse 
        in Garden Grove by an APA organization called OCAPICA [Orange County Asian 
        Pacific Islander Community Alliance]. I went there and it was my first 
        exposure to poetry. My friend, Cyrus Chen, who actually goes to Berkeley 
        was reciting his writings that day and my reaction was, &#8220;Nice, finally, 
        I can do less talking and more writing, sort of like AIM, but much more 
        creative, I suppose.&#8221; From then on, equipped with my limited intelligence, 
        miniscule wisdom, and teenage angst, I began to write little accounts 
        of my daily thoughts via pad and pen.</p>
      <p><strong>When did you first perform?</strong><br>
        I acquired this strange knack for making funny noises with my mouth, a.k.a. 
        beat boxing, and so I was invited to go to a talent show in UCSD. I went 
        there and performed, and, later on, I was invited to come back to perform 
        for an APA event. I had gathered some thoughts about issues regarding 
        APIs and myself and edited it into a spoken word piece called &#8220;For 
        the wasted tears that spilled in slants&#8221; and that was my first spoken 
        word performance. I stuttered really badly at one point but it was a good 
        experience. I blanked out on a stanza and I tried to play it off with 
        a long pause. They got the point after 10 seconds. </p>
      <p><strong>Who have you performed with? </strong><br>
        I was always solo. I&#8217;ve done collaborative pieces before with folks 
        from Balagtasan Collective in LA and Zero Three, but I never really committed 
        to a group. </p>
      <p><strong>What themes do you write about?</strong><br>
        I used to write a lot about topics of self, social equality, identity, 
        religion, etc. Poetry I feel is always a reflection of what the writer 
        is going through. That&#8217;s pretty much a given. It can be as sporadic 
        as daily life, but its progression really depends on the person.</p>
      <p><strong>What&#8217;s your take on the spoken word scene? </strong><br>
        I&#8217;m not sure. It always seems to certainly reflect the general consensus 
        of life in general. Ask me what I think about how people choose to live 
        today, and you will receive your answer about the scene.</p>
      <p><strong>Which musicians and artists are you into at the moment?</strong><br>
        There&#8217;s this gospel/pop singer named Rachael Lampa who&#8217;s really 
        gifted, but in terms of artists in particular, I can&#8217;t think of 
        anything right now.</p>
      <p><strong>Who are your role-models?</strong><br>
        First and foremost, it would be Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior, who 
        sets me free everyday from the deception of seeking my end in myself and 
        in others. My parents are a big inspiration. They&#8217;ve taught me the 
        importance of faith and perseverance in the midst of such difficulties 
        as assimilating into a strange country. Another is Mother Theresa.</p>
      <p><strong>Religion seems to be an important part in your everyday life 
        and your poetry.</strong><br>
        Religion to me is not a mere Sunday obligation. It is not just a human 
        construct that would prevent me from being happy. It is more than an existentialists&#8217; 
        worst conjecture. &#8220;I believe in Christianity as I believe that the 
        Sun as risen not only because I see it but because by it I see everything 
        else.&#8221; -C.S. Lewis. I think there are a lot of stigmas toward religion, 
        Catholicism in particular, and it is a sad thing when human beings cause 
        scandal especially in the name of religion. But, that is certainly not 
        God&#8217;s fault. It is the fallen nature of you and me. I have a lot 
        of Filipino friends who have a lot of issues concerning their beliefs 
        especially because many of them were raised Catholic and the whole issue 
        of colonization is a painful memory. The Church is divine as much as it 
        is human, and there will be bad things that happen. But, I think in general 
        human beings have the tendency to emphasize what is wrong in things and 
        others without searching for meaning or beauty. Imagine if I, who am Korean, 
        shared the view of many of my elders who have some very antagonistic views 
        toward those of Japanese heritage because of all that resulted from imperialism. 
        Then I, too, would perpetuate hate and indifference. This is an entirely 
        different conversation, but just to sum things up: I have been set free 
        in the most literal meaning by being reconciled with God, by humbling 
        myself before Him and not making Him who I want Him to be. There is a 
        love story so great here that the greatest work of poetry or prose could 
        never capture. Drop all preconceived notions, and pray. There is no such 
        thing as a monologue.</p>
      <p><strong>What issues or APA issues are important to you?</strong><br>
        I think issues of stereotypes bred through racism are always lingering 
        if not rampant in different parts of the US. Seeing that I am at UCLA, 
        University of Caucasians Lost among Asians, you don&#8217;t find it too 
        much here. It sort of plays itself off of innocent-lack-of-knowledge of 
        Asian culture, in which case I would encourage others not to get heated 
        but simply educate. Non-APA brothers and sisters were also deprived of 
        proper education in grade school through high school. I&#8217;m always 
        encouraged by a lot of my good friends who really dedicate their lives 
        in serving the community from working for rights of undocumented workers 
        all the way to organizing youth APA coffeehouses. It&#8217;s really beautiful 
        to see the charity in their hearts and their desire to educate. Most first 
        and second generation folks in the US are affected by the issues, but 
        until they go to a fancy Asian American studies course they don&#8217;t 
        know what the terms for it are really.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you feel that through your poetry that you are an influence 
        on the API community?</strong><br>
        God willing, sure.</p>
      <p><strong>What do you hope to do in the future regarding poetry?</strong><br>
        I&#8217;m sure I will use poetry in every time period of my life from 
        now on. It will simply become a reflection for a reader to see what I&#8217;ve 
        become and I pray that I will become better than what I am now.</p>
      <p><strong>An editor is curious: do you have a girlfriend?</strong><br>
        Ah hah, nope! The single life is sooo great.</p>
      <p><strong>a does of mind entitled &quot;well-edited&quot;</strong></p>
      <p>Here&#8217;s my say on music in general nowadays excuse my cynicism, 
        but &#8220;what the deal is going on?&#8221;: &#8220;is that what it takes 
        to be on the radio?&#8221; inserted words with little worth poetic afterbirth 
        which contaminates the earth transmitted through megahertz which, disperse 
        the verse immersed in curses and rhymes reminiscent nursery lines susceptible 
        to infantile minds entrapped by 105.9 Hip-hop onto the bandwagon mainstream 
        fiends be demanding little content just contentious catch phrases amazes 
        and raises issues and news of sensationalist views and I kneel in the 
        pews asking God to cure their blindness scratch them off my top ten censor 
        list and insist that they use their talents and gifts to glorify something 
        other than themselves something other than their mangled definition of 
        &#8216;love&#8217; something other than self-depriving and scandalizing 
        ways of living I believe music and art need to change, but change needs 
        to begin in our hearts everybody has to recognize very soon that MTV is 
        lying to them pumping them intravenously with false interpretations of 
        happiness and fulfillment leaving them empty with the after taste of ugliness 
        Cathartic ideals to glamour spiels to horoscopes and false hope that don&#8217;t 
        help you cope with any situation Helplessness leading to confusion and 
        frustration take one step back, yes you underground cats too filling your 
        lines with what seems like distorted and jumbled catch phrases hallucinating 
        philosophies that leave listeners more confused than they were before 
        and expect me to throw my hand in the air and shout out at a catch phrase 
        that doesn&#8217;t make sense? well I catch freaked phrases and throw 
        them back and I&#8217;m not going to try to digest that splattered rendition 
        of a misinterpreted thesaurus pressed to vinyl because I think we can&#8217;t 
        give what we don&#8217;t have because I think we need to listen more than 
        we speak because I think we need to find something more than sex and drugs 
        to make us happy because I think I&#8217;ve had enough trying to rebel 
        and swell into a pride ridden self proclaimed poet : slash artist slash 
        activist slash lover slash brother and I need to find Him... who nourishes 
        me Him... who strengthens me Him... who cures me of my so-called wisdom 
        and leads me to Truth. to the Way and to the Life and I think I just might 
        have tasted a drop of something greater than this world unfurled into 
        silence, contemplation, and prayer. it is rare today to find anyone who 
        worships the beauty of creation without executing in their hearts their 
        Creator who gives them the freedom to be...I see... a need for change. 
        everywhere. in me. in you. that&#8217;s it for now... perhaps we&#8217;ll 
        buy new journals and begin to think differently now. I&#8217;ll be praying 
        for that day. </p>
