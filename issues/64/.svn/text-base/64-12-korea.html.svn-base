    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> North Korea has once 
        again become one of the most important and pressing issues in the international 
        community. Dubbed by Dubbya as part of the &#8220;axis of evil&#8221;, 
        North Korea has presented the international community with a new set of 
        concerns. Recently, North Korea has admitted that it has broken a 1994 
        promise to freeze the development of nuclear weapons. <br>
        <br>
        Following WWII, Korea was split into two halves, the Northern half being 
        communist and the Southern half more Western. The founder of the Democratic 
        People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Kim Il Sung died in 1994 and his son 
        Kim Jong Il assumed control of the Stalinist regime. <br>
        <br>
        North Korea has a population of more that 22 million, 1.1 million of which 
        are in the military. P&#8217;yongyang, the capitol of North Korea is the 
        center of one of the world&#8217;s most centrally planned and isolated 
        economies. With a GDP of about 21 billion dollars, the North Korean economy 
        pales in comparison to South Korea&#8217;s 407 billion dollar GDP and 
        the United States 9.1 trillion dollar GDP. North Korea receives about 
        201 million dollars in bilateral and multilateral aid yearly. <br>
        <br>
        The North Korean Military is one of the largest in the world, with roughly 
        1.1 million actively serving. The North Korean government military expenditure 
        is about 31.3% of its GDP. The large amount the military spends eats resources 
        that could be used for investment and civilian consumption. <br>
        <br>
        This year has been the eighth year of food shortages in North Korea. During 
        the 1990s, North Korea saw some of the worst famines in its history. With 
        million of starving women and children, the country remains heavily dependent 
        on massive outside aid to feed its 22 million people.<br>
        <br>
        The current North Korean crisis is just the latest in a long history of 
        confrontations between North Korea and the United States. In 1993, North 
        Korea created the first nuclear crisis, pushing the Korean peninsula to 
        the brink of war. After months of diplomacy, including a trip to P&#8217;yongyang 
        by Jimmy Carter, the United States and North Korea reached a deal, The 
        Agreed Framework in Geneva in 1994, where the United States offered fuel 
        oil and two light water nuclear reactors in exchange for a freeze in North 
        Korea&#8217;s nuclear program. On August 31, 1998, North Korea fired a 
        multistage missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, proving that 
        it could strike any part of Japan's territory. <br>
        <br>
        The latest crisis has just developed over the last few months, starting 
        in October when North Korean officials revealed to a visiting U.S. delegation 
        that the country had a secret nuclear weapons program using enriched uranium, 
        in violation of the 1994 Framework Agreement. Soon after, the United States, 
        South Korea, and Japan halted oil shipments that were under the 1994 agreement. 
        In December, North Korea proceeded to reactivate its nuclear facilities 
        at Yongbyon that were frozen under the 1994 deal with the United States. 
        Later that month, North Korea began to remove monitoring seals and cameras 
        from its nuclear facilities and kicked IAEA inspectors out of the country. 
        On January 10, 2003 North Korea formally withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
        Treaty. <br>
        <br>
        On February 5, North Korea said that it had resumed normal operations 
        at a nuclear reactor that could be used to produce weapons-grade uranium. 
        Although they claimed that the Yongbyun plant would be only used for electricity, 
        the United States believes that they will be capable of producing nuclear 
        weapons within the next few months. These recent proceedings have prompted 
        the United States to threaten to cut off aid to North Korea.<br>
        So what does North Korea have to gain from these recent events? Many believe 
        that this is part of their age-old tactics of nuclear brinkmanship. North 
        Korea is probably calculating that because Washington right now is preoccupied 
        with Iraq and a war with Iraq seems quite imminent, the United States 
        may be hard-pressed and that the public will not allow for a two-front 
        war. So, North Korea may be calculating that this is an opportune time 
        to negotiate with the United States and try to get some kind of economic 
        package out of the US.<br>
        <br>
        In stark contrast to Iraq, the Bush administration wants to use diplomacy 
        to solve this situation. However, the Bush administration insists that 
        there could be no negotiation with North Korea until they dismantle their 
        nuclear program and freeze their plutonium production. &#8220;No options 
        have been taken off the table, the options of sanctions, the option of 
        additional political moves, no military option&#8217;s been taken off 
        the table, although we have no intention of attacking North Korea as a 
        nation,&#8221; said Secretary of State Colin Powell. Incoming South President 
        Roh Moo-hyun also favors &#8220;engagement&#8221; with North Korea. <br>
        The United States hopes to have multilateral talks with North Korea over 
        the recent events on the Korean Peninsula. &#8220;We are working with 
        our friends and allies and we are using the channels we have with North 
        Korea. And in due course, I believe there will be conversations, but I 
        think they should be in a multilateral setting. However, North Korea insists 
        that it will only negotiate with the United States alone over nuclear 
        issues. In addition, North Korea has declared that any sanctions imposed 
        upon it by the UN Security Council will be considered an act of war. <br>
