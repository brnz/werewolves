<p>The bombers have rolled out, American troops have mobilized, and British troops 
  are already there. We&#146;ve set out nobly and self righteously, food packages 
  in one arm, and an M3A1 Carbine grenade launcher under the other. George W. 
  Bush calls has named this war &#147;our calling.&#148; The world has moved en 
  masse to fight a &#147;war on terrorism,&#148; but this is a strangely suspect 
  term. In the post cold war, have we yet again polarized the people of the world 
  into &#147;us and them,&#148; looking once more for a common cause, an enemy 
  to unite against?</p>
<p>But at what point is it a united community, and at what point is it one mob 
  pitted against another?</p>
<p>Professor. John M. Post of George Washington University Medical School, in 
  a paper prepared for an international conference on the Psychological Foundations 
  of Terrorism, analyzes the language of radical terrorists: &#147;&#146;They&#146;, 
  the establishment, are the source of all evil in vivid contrast to &#145;us,&#146; 
  the freedom fighters, consumed by righteous rage.&#146;&#148; </p>
<p>Americans have noted this first hand, as fundamentalists decry the establishments 
  of capitalism and the exported culture. &#147;These events have divided the 
  world into two camps,&#148; spoke Mr. Bin Laden, &#147; the camp of the faithful, 
  and the camp of infidels.&#148; It is a holy war, and the enemy must be destroyed. 
  It is extremist, unreasonable, and shocking.</p>
<p>But does it just as easily work in reverse? New York City Mayor Giuliani, greatly 
  lauded for his leadership during the crisis, nonetheless incites anxiety in 
  his October 1 speech to the United Nations.</p>
<p> &#147;This is not a time for further study or vague directives,&#148; he declared. 
  &#147;There is no room for neutrality on the issue of terrorism. You&#146;re 
  either with civilization or with terrorists. On one side is democracy, the rule 
  of law and respect for human life; on the other side is tyranny, arbitrary executions 
  and mass murder. We&#146;re right and they&#146;re wrong. It&#146;s as simple 
  as that.&#148;</p>
<p>Is this also extremist, unreasonable, shocking?</p>
<p>We establish the world is now &#147;us&#148; and &#147;them,&#148; but where 
  is the line between the two? Who is civilization and who are the terrorist? 
  What to say of a civilized government that carries out acts of terror? What 
  are the sacrifices so called civilization is willing to make to defeat the &#147;enemy&#148;?</p>
<p>The US thus far, as any self perpetuating entity, has acted in its own interest. 
  It decried human rights violations and yet sold land mines to the violators. 
</p>
<p>Note the case of Sri Lanka. The country has suffered violent ethnic conflict 
  for the last twenty years. Minority ethnic Tamils in the Northeast had long 
  claimed political disenfranchisement, discrimination in higher education, and 
  a host of other grievances with the national government since independence. 
  Twenty years ago, the struggle turned violent when the separatist group LTTE 
  took over, and the country had been engaged in civil war since. Both the Sri 
  Lankan government and the LTTE had been cited for human rights violations such 
  arbitrary civilian death, torture, and information censorship. Government forces 
  also have on their list mass graves, food as a weapon of war, rape as a weapon 
  of war, police brutality, arbitrary detention, and various others. Despite the 
  acts of terror committed by both sides, the Sri Lankan government is labeled 
  as &#147;civilization&#148; by the US and the minority LTTE, as terrorist.</p>
<p>Labels may be arbitrary, but weapons of mass destruction are not. In 1996, 
  the US , claiming &#147;no dog in this fight,&#148; as American military attache 
  Col. Carl Kockrum put it, acted other wise, selling the government patrol boats, 
  guns, and military helicopters, as well as deploying American Green Beret specialist 
  to train Sri Lankan troupes. This occurred despite the official ban on selling 
  US lethal weapons to a country with such a hefty human rights records. The State 
  Department claimed a recent &#147;dramatic&#148; improvement in the country&#146;s 
  record, although human rights groups within the country claimed gross overstatement. 
</p>
<p>The Pentagon, usually publicizing such joint military exercises with great 
  fanfare, was fairly covert in the matter, as was the Sri Lankan government. 
  The relationship between US and Sri Lankan officials may have sprung from the 
  Gulf War, in which Sri Lanka was the only Asian nation to allow the US to build 
  refueling stations on their land. US officials also admit they are attracted 
  to Sri Lanka&#146;s strategic position between the Middle East and Far east 
  and near China. It is a fairly common deal, in which a foreign military receives 
  valuable training from the US, while US intelligence gains knowledge of the 
  workings of the foreign military for potential later use. But in those other 
  cases, those armies were not about to be engaged in an internal struggle with 
  its own people. Many fear the Sri Lankan government will use the recent attacks 
  and antiterrorist sentiment to perpetuate its human rights violations with more 
  monetary support as than ever more.</p>
<p>A more recent example of the contradictions in Giuliani&#146;s &#147;civilization&#148; 
  is the case of the Cairo 52, in which police raided a gay club in Cairo, Egypt 
  last May and arrested 52 men, detaining them for accusations ranging from &#147;obscene 
  behavior&#148; to running a homosexual &#147;cult&#148; Egypt, an ally of the 
  United States, is guilty of various human rights violations: torture under detention, 
  lack of legal representation, names, pictures and addresses published in State-run 
  media. Criminal penalties for consensual homosexual activity violates international 
  law. Also, gross irregularities and inconsistencies in the case indicate the 
  men may have been framed in order to appease conservative and religious forces.</p>
<p>Complicating the matter was the September 11 attack. The men had been tried 
  in a court in which the ruling cannot be overturned, violating international 
  codes for a fair trial. All 52 men were under accusations which amounted to 
  &#147;organizing to undermine the state,&#148; an act that can be considered 
  terrorism. Since the US attack, the lead defendant in the case has been accused 
  of having connections to Osama bin Laden. &#147;Egypt is going to use terrorism 
  as an excuse to crack down on the local gay community,&#148; said Faisal Alam, 
  leader of a gay Muslim group watching the events. </p>
<p>Sharon Burke, of Amnesty International, is also dubious, claiming the charges 
  constantly change so police can justify the arrests, since there is no specific 
  antihomosexual law in Egypt. Also the &#147;[terrorist] thing is suspect, given 
  the timing,&#148; she said.</p>
<p>The verdict is scheduled to pass November 12. Until then various organizations, 
  as well as some US congressman, have been undertaking a letter writing campaign 
  to Egyptian embassies. Many human rights group globally fear the US, in its 
  haste to build a front against terrorism, will easily overlook blatant violations 
  of rights committed by those on the side of &#147;civilization.&#148; For effective 
  long-term relationships, such concerns are crucial. &#147;We would urge the 
  US. Government to keep human rights on the agenda,&#148; she said. And perhaps 
  not be so hasty in its divisive and hypocritical rhetoric. </p> </td>
