<h2>living the mixed life: growing up as a black chinese muslim in america</h2></a>
by laylaa abdul-khabir


<p><b><i>Are we defined by our ethnicity?</i></b></p>

<p>As a young girl, I thought my ethnic identity was the same as everyone
else’s. At five-years old, I had just returned to the United States
from China after living with my grandparents in Beijing for two years.
Starting elementary school in America, I thought all the kids in my
class were the same ‘color’ as me and it didn’t occur to me that anyone
had different ethnic or cultural backgrounds. I didn’t think at the
time that my mom is Chinese, and my dad is African-American; to me,
they were just my mom and dad and we were no different from the typical
American family. Being raised in a Muslim home, I wore a scarf on my
head to school to cover my hair, and when my classmates asked me why, I
said, “It’s because of my religion.” I had a vague sense of being
different from the other kids because of this, but otherwise, I was a
kid caught up in my own world. In class, I fit my shapes together,
organized my Crayolas, and usually finished first in the mini-Math
problem set. (Should I have known I was Asian then?) Of course, I
counted my numbers in Chinese when learning addition and subtraction,
but this didn‘t bother me; I just did it naturally. I didn’t perceive
myself to be distinctively different from the standard first-grader.</p>

    

<p>It was only later, during the last few years of elementary school,
when I noticed I had to start defining myself. Since I look more
Asian than Black, kids would approach me and ask me things like, “Are
you Japanese?” or “What are you?” and, the question that would follow
me throughout my middle and high school years, “Why do you wear that
thing on your head?” That’s when I began identifying myself as
“Chinese,” in response to those first questions. I did so mainly
because it seemed to satisfy others’ queries as to my Asian
appearance. I’m not sure if I felt entirely Chinese then; for the
most part, I still felt like everybody else because I didn’t
distinguish people primarily by ethnicity. As to the headscarf, I was
still part of some vague ‘other’ religion that identified me as a
Muslim, but it was an identity that I myself did not yet quite
understand or identify with.</p>

 

<p>In my family, my mother has always been the one who has emphasized
education for me and my sisters, while my father places the focus on
religion. My mother is a first-generation Chinese immigrant. She met
my father when she went to college in Ohio, where he grew up and
became the first in his family to go beyond a high school education.
My parents are both converts to Islam. Growing up in our household
wasn’t easy; both parents had high standards for my sisters and I, in
terms of our personal behavior and academics, and this is a mentality
that we've carried with us even after leaving home.</p>

 

<p>In starting community college after high school, I became more
connected to my ethnic roots, and more accurately defined myself as
“half-Chinese, half-Black.” In doing so, I’ve become accustomed to
getting the ‘mixed stare’, the stare people give after learning
someone is biracial in an attempt to figure out how all their
physical features fit together. However, when I began defining myself
in this broader way, my thinking and my perspective changed as well.
Instead of seeing myself as a member of one ethnic group out of the
many that exist in this country, I became more cosmopolitan in
thinking. I began to feel like I had a little of everyone in me;
being Black, Chinese, Muslim, and American all at once, nearly anyone
I came across could relate to me in some way after learning my
background. Encompassing so many identities allowed many people of
various backgrounds to feel an affinity for me. My close friends in
community college were of various ethnic stripes; some were
Jordanian, Chinese, Korean, Black, Caucasian, and Mexican. I realized
the great potential of race, and my racial identity in particular, to
serve as a bridge between people of different backgrounds.</p>

 

<p>On the other hand, however, things weren’t always straightforward. I
have so many identities that sometimes, growing up, it was difficult
deciding who I was. Society tends to propagate certain sets of
stereotypes or myths associated with each ethnic group, and although
we sometimes write these off, I feel as if they subconsciously affect
us, seeping into us when we aren’t paying attention. From casual
racial jokes to associating qualities with people based on their
ethnicity, I feel that we have, perhaps inadvertently, created sets
of expectations that are associated with each ethnic identity. For a
while as I was growing up, I felt increased pressure, mostly
self-inflicted, to succeed in academics in a misguided effort to
‘embrace’ my Asian identity. Being one of the few Asians at my
school, I especially felt I had to prove myself in my math and
science courses. I was trying to find my ‘niche’ and I did so by
attempting to live up to a general stereotype of Asians, which in my
mind had turned into an expectation. Most of us would agree that race
inherently, by itself, does not make anyone smarter, kinder, or more
righteous than anyone else. However, associating standards or
expectations with certain racial groups can create an environment of stereotypes, 

even casual ones. While most of us wouldn’t outrightly
agree with general race stereotypes like, for instance, that Asians
are inherently better at the sciences or that African-Americans have
innate athletic prowess, the subliminal influence of these messages is
often underestimated.</p>

 

<p>I’ve grown out of living up to stereotypes now. Since leaving the
home of my parents and coming to Berkeley, I’ve had to forge my own
path and identity. I feel that there are many people who go through
their lives trying to live up to expectations that they perceive
their family, friends, or the larger community to hold for them.
Also, I feel that many people take their identity almost as a given,
not as something either they themselves have constructed, or that
others have constructed for them. I believe in constructing my own
identity, based on the values and belief system I hold. My ethnicity
speaks to where I come from, the cultures of my parents and
grandparents, and also the cultural environment in which I was
raised. However, my ethnicity says little about the person that I am,
because it does not speak to the morals or beliefs I hold, or even to
my personality. My ethnicity, in essence, does not define me; it is
simply an ornament to my identity. I love my biracial heritage, and
it is interesting and unconventional, but it doesn’t enrich my life
with deeper meaning. Despite how unique my racial background is, it
was not something I had a choice in.</p>

 

<p>Because I have decided that I don’t want my ethnicity to be my
primary level of identifying myself, I’ve had to go on a deeper
search in the construction of my identity. In earlier times, my
Islamic faith had simply been something I inherited from my parents,
not something I found for myself and embraced. Today, I identify
myself first as a Muslim, because my faith directs my value system,
and gives my life greater purpose and meaning. Faith gives a person
an explanation for why they are here in this world, and what they
must do with their lives until they inevitably die, something I
couldn’t find anywhere else. Since starting community college and
later coming to Berkeley, I’ve learned a lot about other religions
and belief systems. I choose my faith, Islam, because it gives me a
level of clarity and peace that I don’t see anywhere else. My
cultural heritage gives me a history, a backdrop upon which to paint
the person I choose to be, and the values, beliefs and actions that
define me.</p>

 

<p>Today, I still get asked the same questions about ethnicity as I did
when I was a kid, only in a slightly more sophisticated manner. I
still grapple with issues of race and identity, and where I fit into
this complex puzzle that is American society. When I first came to
Berkeley, the great diversity in its people and the range of social
and political expressions I observed intrigued me. My initial and
lasting impression of Berkeley is that it is a place in which people
have great freedom in expression, as evidenced by its history, and
it’s a place where people are free to define themselves. I’ve tried
to hold on to this sentiment as I struggle to define and give voice
to my identity.</p>
