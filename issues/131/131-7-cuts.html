<h2>Feeling the Cuts</h2>
by denise wong

<p><b><i>How present budget proposals threaten the voice and interests of Cal’s API community</i></b></p>

<p>On September 24, 2009, approximately 5,000
demonstrators stormed both Sproul Plaza and downtown
Berkeley as part of a system-wide walkout against the Regents
of the University of California’s mismanagement of the current
budget crisis. Weeks of unprecedented student and faculty
criticism towards the state and university administration
culminated in this historic walkout. It also marked the first
instance in these weeks of organizing and debate that
the budget proposals’ impact on API students was openly
discussed outside of API spaces.</p>
<p>Lack of discussion on the budget cuts’ impact on
APIs is the largest obstacle preventing APIs from creating
a unified stance on this issue. The fact that students will be
paying more for longer waitlists, larger classes, decreased
resources and a generally lower quality education should
not be an issue that garners apathy. Rally speakers and
students alike have lauded the walkout’s success, likening it
to the protests of the Free Speech Movement and declaring
it the return of a long-dormant tradition of Berkeley activism;
however, reported figures of attendance prove meager when
compared to the sheer amount of API students whom the
proposals will adversely impact. The amount of APIs at the
walkout was obviously less than 5,000. APIs constitute about
45% of the student body, and the fact that our numbers alone
could potentially effect real change but have not been utilized
to their full potential is shameful.</p>
<p>It is imperative to examine the implications of these
budget proposals’ effects on API students. These cuts would
slice students’ bank accounts at the jugular for visibly lowerquality
academic services, which is reason enough to take
alarm. However, these cuts would also impact Berkeley in
several different ways, making huge blows to not only APIs
but API interests—that is, the values and goals that give
direction to the API community and ensure that it transcends
merely racially-based organizing. Here’s a summary of three
major ways in which these budget cuts will directly impact API
students and API interests:<p>
<p><b>1. Vindication for cutting classes, departments, and
educational programs relevant to API interests</b></p>
<p>Historically, ethnic studies, the department that
houses Berkeley’s Asian American studies program, has
been continuously assailed by budget cuts. These cuts were
often backed by an unfortunately pervasive and incorrect
view that the discipline promotes racism and self-segregation
by concentrating on race and racial history. Opposition to
the department has existed since
its inception, and has frequently
materialized through budget cuts and
hiring policies that inhibit the young
department’s growth. According to
department chair Beatriz Manz in
a May 4, 2009 article in The Daily
Californian, the department took an
8% budget blow this year.</p>
<p>Given its highly contentious status, it is unsurprising
that both Berkeley and UC administrators have frequently
placed the department on the chopping block. Times of
economic crisis make it easier for the administration to
squelch ethnic studies and repress the expansion of Asian
American studies curricula, despite an increasing number of
API students.</p>
<p>These proposals threaten not only ethnic studies
and Asian American studies, but also other classes relevant
to APIs and API student development, such as language
classes. The victory of the student movement to protect East
Asian Language from the budget cuts in 2008 is rendered
irrelevant with the current threat. According to a September 10
radio interview given by API Education and Languages NOW!
members Andrew Leong and Amy Lee, the most current
most pressing issue is job security for non-tenured lecturers,
members of faculty most vulnerable to lay-offs. Asian language
classes are taught by lecturers rather than tenured professors,
rendering them most susceptible to cuts. Not only do lecturers
work more hours and make less than professors, but they are
also prohibited from striking due to union-negotiated contracts,
according to Leong and Lee. It thus does not matter how
many exponentially the API student body grows or how high
the demand for language courses is. Shortages of lecturers
indubitably translate into shortages of API language classes,
especially those that have been continuously trivialized as
“service courses,” marginal contributions to students’ holistic
edifications.</p>
<p><b>2. Exclusion of lowand middle-income APIs from enrolling,
especially in pre-professional fields such as business and
engineering</b></p>
<p>It is already obvious that such dramatic tuition raises
will price out API students from underserved, low-income
communities, but similarly damaging are the differential fees
levied on students in business and engineering. The notion that
an additional $1,000 fee on business and engineering students
would effectively preserve the character and diversity of Haas
or the College of Engineering assumes the homogenization of
these colleges’ student bodies. This dangerously insinuates
the validity of the “model minority” myth when it comes to
API students. The model minority myth, which erroneously
proclaims that Asian Americans are somehow inherently
genetically wired to succeed, is already an assumption that
has deleteriously steered UC admission policies against API
students. When UC President Mark Yudof was asked by Los
Angeles Times about how Asian American students would be
affected by the new UC admissions standard he off-handedly
replied, “They’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>In theory, this fee fortifies the existing “glass ceiling”
that looms over APIs in professional fields by restricting the
social mobility of APIs and other students of color from lowincome
backgrounds. Berkeley is consistently ranked among
the top ten of business and engineering undergraduate
programs, and is notably one of the few public universities
that can boast such high rankings. Such fees will deny one
of the most viable resources for social mobility to many lowincome
and now middle-income students of color, who are
concomitantly unable to qualify
for financial aid and afford
mounting student fees.</p>
<p>“When you think
about engineering and bstudents,
there are already
students of color struggling
to keep themselves in those
majors,” said Jennifer Phung,
External Relations Coordinator for REACH!, Berkeley’s
Asian/Pacific Islander Recruitment and Retention Center. The
high propensity for financial success is largely what attracts
underserved APIs to pre-professional majors. Given the
increasing costs of getting into college in the first place, the
imposition of high differential fees would put underserved APIs
at an even greater disadvantage to attain educational access
and would further exacerbate their underrepresentation in
various levels of these professional fields.</p>
<p><b>3. Smaller API progressive spaces, resulting in a silenced
voice for API interests and issues</b></p>
<p>A less salient point in the ongoing dialogue in how
budget cuts affect students of color is the decrease of students
in the progressive community. Berkeley’s progressive
communities are responsible for initiating and defending such
academic programs as ethnic studies and Asian language
courses (Tagalog, for example, began as a DeCal course), as
well as spearheading efforts to recruit students of color.</p>
What has emerged from underprivileged API
students’ abilities to achieve educational access at Berkeley
is the student leadership that allows the API community to
have a voice. Many of these involved students come from
underserved communities in California, and the proposed
decrease of in-state enrollment will indirectly quell this voice.
This would occur through a variety of consequences: firstly, the
college admissions process already favors wealthier students,
and reduced spots for resident students make the jobs of lowincome
API applicants even harder. Secondly, despite the
rhetoric surrounding this issue, this policy was not designed
to benefit out-of-state and international students, but rather, to
benefit those who can pay the exorbitant out-of-state tuition. It
is in this way that these proposals also diminish the education
of progressive out-of-state students; the mistreatment of
immigrant workers, hindrances to API political power and the
displacement of Chinatown and Manilatown residents occur not
only in Oakland and San Francisco, but also in Philadelphia,
Boston, Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. A reduction in instate
students who drive these progressive communities will
result in less people from whom out-of-state students can
learn. As the number one public university, Berkeley has an
obligation to educate the world, and in straying from its roots,
it does all of its students a huge disservice in allowing them
to advance the communities from where they come, from
wherever they may come.</p>
<p>It is as such that the proposed budget plans will
affect all aspects of the API community, its students, and its
interests. In the aftermath of the September 24 walkout, the
question that hangs above everyone’s heads is what to do
next. Nonetheless, the question of how the cuts will affect the
API community must be widely addressed before tackling the
question of how APIs can effectively solidify this movement.</p>


<p><b>budget break down</b><br />
To reiterate a point made multiple times during
the past few weeks, the nature of these cuts
indicates steady strides toward the privatization
of UC Berkeley. These budget proposals
include:<br /><br />
- A 32% fee increase ($2,500) for in-state students,
resulting in about $10,000 per year<br />
- A 7% fee increase in Spring 2010<br />
- An additional $1,000 fee increase on business
and engineering students<br />
- An in-state enrollment reduction of 2,300
students<br />
- 1,900 layoffs across all campuses, as well as
professor furloughs (forced, non-paid off-days)</p>
