    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> Ever wondered about 
        the future of the nationalist project? Consider this newspaper for instance. 
        Under the broad umbrella of the identifier API, we try to cover a wide 
        array of issues that affect the communities that are understood to be 
        included in that category. In effect, hardboiled serves as a catalyst 
        for bringing the progressive community together. To that end, my contribution 
        to this paper has been to contribute the perspectives of South Asians 
        and Pacific Islanders. But I would like to draw this into a much larger 
        debate on the ramifications of ethnic nationalism and the future of progressivism 
        on this campus. <br>
        <br>
        Though I have been away from Cal for a while now, I still keep tabs on 
        what&#8217;s going on. A particularly helpful medium is the Indus Forum 
        email list. With my subscription, I am able to keep up with the latest 
        developments: upcoming bhangra events, hindi films, parties, and the occasional 
        banter inspired by some well-meaning but misguided individual. The list 
        is also a great place to look for an MCB or EECS textbook. A few weeks 
        ago, I got a flurry of emails as quite a few students got in on a discussion 
        of Indian history. For a brief while, I was praying to receive a party 
        email from wannabegangstah productions.<br>
        <br>
        This exchange highlights a central concern for those of us struggling 
        for progressive multi-culturalism in this nation. Perhaps as a byproduct 
        of how immigrants construct their identities over generations and also 
        out of the practicality of staying relevant to issues in the US, and not 
        the politics of the homeland, there is not much discussion of how ethnic-nationalism 
        factors into the construction of progressivism. <br>
        <br>
        It is something we should consider&#8212;especially those who still have 
        particularly close ties abroad.<br>
        <br>
        Take the case of a discussion on Indus mailing list&#8212;not that I want 
        to slander Indus with the charge of being progressive. A student disgruntled 
        by Professor Robert Goldman&#8217;s South Asian Studies course emailed 
        the list with his displeasure. It seems what was bothering him was the 
        way in which Professor Goldman had dismissed one theory on the settlement 
        of ancient India for another.<br>
        <br>
        At the core of the students&#8217; argument is the belief that Goldman 
        is an agent of the colonial venture by favoring the Aryan Invasion Theory 
        over the Out of India Theory&#8212;helping in the colonizing of the knowledge 
        of India. <br>
        <br>
        What are these theories? They are theories on the settlement of ancient 
        India&#8212;when, where, and the most important, how. They are two very 
        different understandings of the trajectory of Indian history. <br>
        <br>
        The Aryan Invasion Theory first appeared in the discourse of the British. 
        It was employed to construct India&#8217;s identity as a wounded civilization. 
        Glorious and mighty in its ancient era, it has been on a gradual decline 
        since that ancient hey-day, as invaders chipped away at the splendor of 
        vedic India. Since this is an Orientalist British history, then it has 
        to be pointed out that this decline that India was in could only be remedied 
        by the British colonial endeavor&#8212;the task of returning India to 
        its ancient glory. <br>
        <br>
        The 19th century was when it can be said that nationalist discourse took 
        roots in many colonized societies&#8212;organized responses to foreign 
        power, but with people mobilized by the rhetoric of very modern, post-enlightenment 
        ideas of nationalism. What this meant in India was that there was an Indian 
        response to the British presence was a national one, and not one based 
        on other identities. Just as in the Philippines, reaction was not based 
        on a local or communal level, but national. The point is fine, but one 
        not worth missing. <br>
        <br>
        When India became independent, its new leaders did not challenge the British 
        understanding of history, instead they chose to insert themselves into 
        the narrative&#8212;stipulating that the Indian state now possessed the 
        British mantle of returning India to its ancient greatness.<br>
        The anti-colonial environment of the 19th and early 20th centuries brought 
        forth many ideas. Some of the most popular were the backlash against the 
        perceived indignities offered by the British theories on the origins of 
        the Indian people. So, homegrown rhetoric began to counter the production 
        of this knowledge. Out of that milieu was produced the Out of India Theory. 
        Running counter to the Aryan Invasion Theory, it states that the motley 
        tribes known as the Aryans actually originated in India and settled in 
        a northwestern direction from India to Europe. There is much more evidence 
        to support the opposite position&#8212;the migration of various tribes 
        from the Caucasus region into South Asia. <br>
        <br>
        This issue is boring. Playing Dungeons and Dragons is more exciting than 
        talking about these theories. There literally is a million things in Indian 
        history more deserving of study. But, it remains at the forefront of discussion 
        because the Out of India Theory is has been husbanded by Hindu nationalists 
        and their small band of pseudo-scholars like David Frawley, Pierre Gautier, 
        and Subhash Kak. These individuals are celebrated for their unfortunate 
        fascination with outdated theories of race, religion, history, etc. The 
        first two are disaffected westerners who seek to offer the validation 
        of Hindu nationalism, that only disaffected westerners can give (be VERY 
        scared of Islam!). The third individual is an engineering professor from 
        a Louisiana university who has made the unfortunate mistake of extending 
        his academic credentials to an area where he has no understanding. Still, 
        they are extremely popular in the South Asian American community because 
        their ideologies offer a salve for a group that has the task of crafting 
        its identity outside of its national territory.<br>
        Remember, what is important here is the impact these conservative ideologies 
        of the homeland have on the development of progressive ideas here in the 
        US. We only have to take a look at Zionism and how overseas Jews, especially 
        those residing in the US are some of the most ardent supporters. What 
        this means for those of us with international connections is that we have 
        to make sure we have an in-depth understanding of the history&#8212;as 
        well as the debate around the history.<br>
        <br>
        I have been told that if you walk around an Indian city today, it is possible 
        to pick up a Nazi swastika from street vendors. Not the Hindu swastika, 
        but the Nazi one. The popularity of these fascist ideologies in India 
        is very concerning. The ideological connection between 1930s German nationalism 
        and Hindu nationalism is uncanny&#8212;down to the fascination with martial 
        authority and fashion.<br>
        <br>
        Those of us with family or other connections abroad must be wary of the 
        histories and ideologies that are presented to us. The anti-colonial struggles 
        from places as diverse as Indonesia, India, and the Philippines provide 
        the stories that can be used to inspire progressive action here. Ethnic 
        chauvinism and ethno-centrism is subtle, but it has to be rooted out because 
        it will get us nowhere. <br>
