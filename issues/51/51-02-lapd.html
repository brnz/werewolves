<p>In 1996, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) mistakenly arrested 81-year-old 
  Korean male Dong Sik Chong, as he was unable to communicate with the police 
  in English, in turn, productively refute his wrongful arrest. The LAPD did not 
  provide Chong with a translator and eventually released him unsupervised. Two 
  days after his arrest, Chong was found beaten and mugged and subsequently contracted 
  pneumonia, dying two months later. In the end, Chong&#146;s family blamed the 
  lack of available translation as causing Chong&#146;s mistreatment and eventual 
  death, and pleaded with mobilized activist groups to raise awareness of the 
  issue. As a result, a task force that included community groups and law enforcement 
  offices was formed with the intent of providing recommendations that would improve 
  the LAPD&#146;s Multilanguage Program. However, according to the results of 
  a recent survey headed by the Asian Pacific Islander Police Advisory Council 
  (APIPAC), the making of improvements is far from complete. </p>

  The fact of the matter is that Asian Americans, many of whom are 1st generation 
  immigrants with limited English skills, are one of the most rapidly growing 
  populations in California.

<p>On June 12, 2001, a coalition of immigrants&#146; rights groups, headed by 
  the APIPAC, released the results of a survey claiming that Non-English-speaking 
  callers to the Los Angeles Police Department frequently receive no language 
  translation, incomplete information and rude responses from police employees. 
  The survey tested the LAPD&#146;s ability to respond to callers who spoke Spanish, 
  Korean, Mandarin, Thai or Japanese, and when foreign language speaking volunteers 
  called police stations for assistance on filing a complaint, just about a third 
  of the callers were connected with appropriate translators. According to Johnny 
  Lai, co-chair of APIPAC, translation was often inadequate or not even provided. 
  Lai reported than in some instances LAPD employees hung up on callers when they 
  failed to speak English, even telling callers &#147;only English spoken here.&#148; 
  According to an LAPD department official, approximately one-third of the LAPD&#146;s 
  employees are Spanish speaking Latinos whereas fewer than 7% are Asian American, 
  as the survey noted that Spanish-language translation tended to be more readily 
  available than translation for Asian languages. </p>
<p>This previous lack of the LAPD&#146;s receptiveness towards its multilingual 
  population, evinced in Dong Sik Chong&#146;s ill treatment and the dearth of 
  available Asian language translation, signifies the protruding manifestation 
  of the city&#146;s oblivion to its inherent multicultural population dating 
  back to the Los Angeles riots of 1992. It was not until the media&#146;s extensive 
  news coverage of Korean entrepreneurs and their businesses being targeted for 
  looting and arson did people nationally recognize that a substantial Korean 
  American population existed in LA. The fact of the matter is that Asian Americans, 
  many of whom are 1st generation immigrants with limited English skills, are 
  one of the most rapidly growing populations in California. Based on the 2000 
  data produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Asian population, which previously 
  consisted of 9 percent of California&#146;s population in 1990, now comprises 
  11 to 12 percent of Californians. Though they are far outnumbered by whites 
  and Hispanics in Los Angeles, Asian Americans make up 11.8 percent of the city&#146;s 
  population. The study headed by the APIPAC found unsatisfactory results for 
  the availability of translation when calls were made to the four LAPD divisions&#151;Rampart, 
  Hollywood, Wilshire, and Central, all districts which frequently serve non-English-speaking 
  citizens, according to Kimi Lee, co-chair of the APIPAC. All in all, it is no 
  mystery that Los Angeles is neglecting the basic needs of its significant Asian 
  population, many of whom are laden with language deficiencies. </p>
<p>However, progress is being made. Recently the LAPD has been setting increased 
  incentives and improved tracking methods to attract a more ethnically diverse 
  police force with greater multilingual skills by offering tuition reimbursement 
  for employees who enroll in community college language courses and up to 5.5% 
  salary increases for those who can prove their foreign language proficiency 
  by passing tests. In addition, each LAPD patrol car will now contain computerized 
  translation devices. The task force created in the aftermath of Chong&#146;s 
  mistreatment has provided numerous recommendations calling for the extensive 
  training and hiring of multilingual police officers, but the task force&#146;s 
  quarterly meetings have halted before many of its recommendations could be fulfilled 
  after the police commission leadership changed. Community groups must now educate 
  the new members of the police commission in order to move along with proposals 
  to track more multilingual officers within the LAPD. </p>
<p>In the midst of the entire problem, the most far-reaching solution is to track 
  a larger number of multilingual officers who have the ability to communicate 
  fluently with the greater LA public in foreign languages, as it is also the 
  fastest and most effective way to deal with the situation. Although some officers 
  may take the time to take courses in foreign languages, achieving fluency in 
  a another language is an enormous feat requiring extensive time and effort, 
  and though translation devices will assist officers somewhat in foreign communication, 
  as in the exact words of Police Chief Bernard Parks, &#147;giving someone a 
  cheat sheet without a lesson in pronunciation may not help assistance at all.&#148; 
  The APIPAC is currently on an agenda to educate all the new members of the police 
  commission and meet with the commission and Chief Parks pertaining to these 
  matters.  </td>
