<p>For those of us who were around in Berkeley back in 1998, we can remember the 
  way things used to be. Many eateries and cafes with only a few places for those 
  Asian milk tea drinks, also known as &#147;Boba.&#148; Within the past three 
  to four years, however, it seems as though everybody is selling Boba. Starting 
  out as a quick way for some of the restaurants in the Durant Food Court to make 
  some extra money on the side, the drinks that are largely popular in Taiwan, 
  Hong Kong and other East Asian metropolises have begun their migration to the 
  western hemisphere. It is the free market at work with entrepreneurs responding 
  to the demand by the large East Asian American population on campus. This trend 
  has culminated in the start up of shops set up explicitly to sell these drinks, 
  such as Quikeley and the Sweetheart Caf&eacute;, which specialize in those drinks, 
  and have built a periphery menu around them. To get a better sense of the phenomenon, 
  included is a background on three of the many places that sell Boba tea drinks: 
  Mandarin House, the Sweetheart Caf&eacute; and Quikeley. </p>

  <p class="sidebarheadline">INTERVIEW WITH A DISGRUNTLED BOBA TEA WORKER</p>
  <p><b>Why did you start working where you did?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: I needed money! Plus, the no tax deduction thing was nice &#150; I got 
    paid under the table.</p>
  <p><b>Did you quit? Or did they fire you?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: I quit, I didn't call to give them my schedule, and they didn't call 
    me back to follow up. They also tried to get me to bus tables. It's really boring. 
    The turnover rate is high.</p>
  <p><b>Why did you quit?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: The amount of labor is not worth the pay and its long hours. It's slave 
    labor.</p>
  <p><b>Will you still drink it after knowing what's in it? Or is it like eating 
    a hot dog after you know what goes in it?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: Occasionally, just not from my former employer.</p>
  <p><b>What exactly goes into Boba?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: sugar, milk, tea shaken, not stirred.</p>
  <p><b>...and what about the fruity flavors?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: the flavor concentrate and water.</p>
  <p><b>Do you think this job will help you with future jobs?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: I won't even put it on my resume. I got paid under the table. I don't 
    think ANYBODY wants to put that they worked as a boba tea worker.</p>
  <p><b>What experiences have you gained from this?</b></p>
  <p>DBTW: I've learned to tip more &#150; Asians don't tip! Oh, and I want to go 
    to bartending school.</p>

<p><b>Mandarin House</b></p>
<p>Mandarin House, in the Durant Food Court, is quite popular for its Boba, yet 
  it was not the initial place that started selling Boba to the Berkeley public. 
  Satay House was the first, but as ownership and management changed hands, the 
  restaurant stopped selling the beverages. While it seems like there is always 
  a line to Mandarin House&#146;s Boba bar, the restaurant says that its income 
  still mainly comes from food sales, and not Boba, though, Boba sales are helpful. 
  Mandarin House attributes its success to better marketing and word of mouth. 
  Before the rise of other venues, Mandarin House was the most widely known source 
  of Boba, and thus it continues to sell well. Since Mandarin House is mainly 
  a family business, there are no future plans to expand unless the restaurant 
  expands as well.</p>
<p><b>Sweetheart Caf&eacute;</b></p>
<p>The Sweetheart Caf&eacute; started its first location in Oakland&#146;s Chinatown. 
  It later decided to expand because its&#146; customer base, management discovered, 
  came from varying parts of the Bay Area. The second expansion store was Milpitas, 
  to serve the large East Asian population in the semi-South Bay area. Finally, 
  the third location was opened up in Berkeley about a year and a half ago. The 
  Sweetheart Caf&eacute;&#146;s Berkeley location is actually more unique than 
  its other outlets-- the Berkeley location has evolved into a food serving restaurant, 
  while its other locations mainly stick to serving beverages and East Asian import 
  candies. The menu was built up around the drinks and the Caf&eacute; sells more 
  drinks than food. For the future, the Sweetheart Caf&eacute; plans on further 
  expansion, but for now, it remains a local East Bay area chain.</p>
<p><b>Quikeley</b></p>
<p>Quikeley started up in May of 2000. The owner&#146;s son studied at UC Berkeley 
  and the owner felt that Berkeley would be a good place to start a Boba tea store. 
  Quikeley is the name of a franchise of Boba tea stores in Taiwan, but despite 
  the same name, the Berkeley shop is not affiliated. The Berkeley location of 
  Quikeley is the main location for Quikeley in the Bay Area, though they have 
  a store in San Francisco Chinatown. Like the Sweetheart Caf&eacute;, Quikeley&#146;s 
  start up was primarily for the Boba beverages, and later, expanded a menu around 
  the drinks. Quikeley differs, however, in that they have a fancy machine to 
  seal the drinks in their container, whereas other stores will use lids. Management 
  also says that while many East Asian Americans come, they get more and more 
  non-Asians buying the tapioca drinks every day. Quikeley also hopes to expand 
  into other locations.</p>
<p>While these drinks still have yet to penetrate mainstream American culture, 
  having locations in Berkeley, San Francisco, Oakland and other multicultural 
  locations is the first step toward diffusion. As the franchise chains get larger 
  and expand, more and more people will be exposed to Boba. One day in the future, 
  you might see the local chains become as prevalent as Starbucks Caf&eacute;s 
  are today.</p>
