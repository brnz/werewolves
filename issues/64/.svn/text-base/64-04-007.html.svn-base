    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> Passionate sex inside 
        of a Buddhist Temple, right in front of a sitting Buddha statue. A freakish 
        looking North Korean with pale white skin and diamonds crushed into his 
        face. A certain Scandinavian man who is actually a North Korean general 
        after having gone through extensively painful gene therapy. Korean characters 
        being played by actors who obviously do not have any grasp of the Korean 
        language. Put all these elements together, and you will end up with the 
        recent controversial James Bond film Die Another Day.<br>
        <br>
        Protests against the film broke out in South Korea even before the film 
        opened up in the country in December 2002. With dialogues being held through 
        internet chatrooms and discussion boards, it became evident that this 
        new James Bond movie was not going to slip through the anti-American radar. 
        Anti-American sentiment has never been an unfamiliar attitude in South 
        Korea. However with the acquittal of two American soldiers who killed 
        two teenage girls by running them over with an armed military vehicle, 
        the feelings were at their peak. Many protested against the gross misrepresentations 
        of Korean people and culture in the film. Boycotts and protests outside 
        of movie theatres occurred all over the country. The film fails to paint 
        an accurate picture of Korea in the 21st century. Instead, the film centers 
        around the theme of James Bond, a white man, saving the world from the 
        &#8220;evil Asians,&#8221; the North Koreans in this case. With North 
        Korea being entered in as the &quot;axis of evil&quot; it was only time 
        before Hollywood jumped back onto the &quot;yellow peril&quot; bandwagon.<br>
        This 20th installment of the James Bond series pivots around the notion 
        that the North Koreans are a gang of evil-doers (with an all-powerful 
        solar laser) whose main goal is to destroy the DMZ (de-militarized zone), 
        which separates the Korean peninsula into North and South. The main mission 
        of James Bond, the ever-so-slick-British-spy, is to catch Zao, a North 
        Korean terrorist/soldier, who is intent on re-uniting the two Koreas through 
        violent means. Not only was actor Rick Yune&#8217;s Korean absolutely 
        brutal to listen to, but the fact that for most of the movie he was a 
        disfigured North Korean albino leads one to wonder if simply being&nbsp;an 
        Asian villain is not scary enough for the modern-day audience. Rick Yune 
        received enormous criticism in South Korea for taking on a role that was 
        not only humiliating to Koreans, but also for single-handedly butchering 
        the Korean language. Cha In Pyo, a popular actor in Korea, was first approached 
        to take on the role of Zao. However, he declined stating that the portrayals 
        of Koreans in the movie, whether they be from South or North, were simply 
        too demeaning. Thus Cha was hailed as a national hero, whereas Yune has 
        become the symbol of how low an Asian actor will go to make a living.<br>
        <br>
        The absolute disregard of cultural accuracy is evident all throughout 
        the film. First of all, what kind of name is Zao for a Korean man? Clearly, 
        Zao is a Chinese name, which leads to two plausible conclusions about 
        the writers of this film. They could have either thought that the Chinese 
        culture and the Korean culture were one in the same. Or they could have 
        simply changed the enemy of the film from being Chinese to North Korean 
        (with all the current events and all) and neglected to change the villain&#8217;s 
        name. After all, if there is anything that the movie teaches, it is that 
        Asians are quite interchangeable.<br>
        <br>
        Another misconception that the filmmaker had about South Korea was that 
        it is a mostly rural and backwards little peninsula. There is a scene 
        in the film where James Bond and his female sidekick, Jinx, are falling 
        out of the South Korean sky in a highly technological gadget only to be 
        viewed suspiciously by a ragged looking Korean farmer dragging an ox by 
        a rope. Perhaps the filmmakers had not heard about metropolitan cities 
        like Seoul or Busan. Or perhaps it is a lot more romantic to think that 
        James Bond was saving a lot of helpless peasants instead of a highly modernized 
        nation-state.<br>
        <br>
        One particularly tasteless and offensive scene comes at the very end of 
        the film when James Bond is having sex in a Buddhist temple. Many Buddhist 
        monks joined the protest ranks claiming that the scene represents an utmost 
        disregard for a sacred Eastern religion. As Chung Han-Shin, of the Jogye 
        Buddhist Order, told the Washington Post, &quot;You don&#8217;t see a 
        Hollywood hit movie where you have a hero like James Bond having sex in 
        a Christian church.&quot; Certainly, if James Bond were to indulge in 
        his carnal desires at church, the Christian opposition all over the world 
        would have probably shut the movie down even before it opened. Like all 
        other Asian elements in the film, including the Asian characters, Buddhism 
        is seen merely as a prop. Perhaps, only at a Buddhist temple could all 
        the exotic &quot;Oriental&quot; items, like the statue of a sitting Buddha, 
        be put on display.<br>
        <br>
        North Korea has united with South Koreans to protest the film. In a statement 
        issued by the Korean Central Broadcasting Station in Pyongyang on December 
        19, 2002, North Korea felt as though this movie was a direct hostile action 
        taken by the United States against Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
        of Korea, AKA North Korea. By belittling the Korean culture and making 
        it seem as though nothing would get accomplished on the Korean peninsula 
        without the Western powers jumping in, the film has essentially relegates 
        the two Koreas as helpless players in a game that is theirs to play. Even 
        the fact that there was not a single South Korean character in the film 
        shows that this North and South Korean situation merely involves the communist 
        country of DPRK and the vehemently anti-communist America. South Korea, 
        as it did at the end of the Korean War in the 1950s, has absolutely no 
        say on the future of the Korean peninsula. <br>
        <br>
        Surely, no one would turn to a James Bond film to understand the complex 
        foreign relations that exist between the U.S. and the two Koreas. However, 
        this film makes it very evident that the South Korean government is essentially 
        run by the Americans and the North Koreans are brutal killing machines. 
        Alas the bearer of Western enlightenment, the white male, comes to the 
        rescue. And once again the world is set right.<br>
