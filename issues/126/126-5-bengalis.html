<h2>Bringing in the Bengalis</h2></a>
by Nashia Lalani</p>

<p><b><i>Bengalis struggle to establish a “Little Bangladesh” in what is currently Koreatown
</i></b></p>

<p>All it takes to spiff up a tasty curry is a bit of garlic, onion, ginger, curry powder, a few more spices and voila! Just as all of these ingredients are needed to stir up a bowl of delight, so too does each and every one of us contribute to this huge melting pot of cultures which we find all around us today. Various ethnic groups all come together in perfect harmony create the diverse society that we live in today. </p>
<p>Sound too cliché? Yeah, I totally feel you. Here’s the real deal. Just as you may add a bit too much spice, creating a curry that is too overwhelming for your taste buds, a combination of different cultures sharing one environment does not always lead to a perfect outcome. Different groups indeed struggle and clash with one another to gain more representation and add more or their own flavor, so to speak, to a particular space. </p>
<p>From the Chinatown in San Francisco all the way to the Koreatown in Los Angeles, different ethnic groups struggle to establish a space to call “a home away from home.” For many immigrants that enter the U.S., creating such a niche has benefits that are two-fold; while ethnic enclaves create a comfort zone for newcomers, they can also provide a profitable way for new immigrants to start their own businesses.  </p>
<p>Established in the 1870s, Koreatown in Los Angeles is an ideal example of such a locale. Recently, a debate over allocating some of this space for the development of a “Little Bangladesh” has fueled quite a bit of controversy. The growing number of Bengalis in the area have been pushing city officials for a little bit of name recognition in this busy location. They are asking for a section of businesses from Third Street to Wilshire Boulevard as well as from Vermont Avenue to be renamed “Little Bangladesh,” as per the original petition.</p>
<p>Residents have mixed reactions. Some shop owners don’t see the big deal in supporting the creation of this area and appreciate the sense of multiculturalism. Others claim that not only have the Koreans put in great effort over the years to build a cultural abode for themselves but the area requested cuts right into a big chunk of Koreatown where few Bengalis are even living. In addition to the sentimental aspect in this name change, there is also a debate over the economic control that comes with the renaming. As one veteran of the locale, Margaret Ko, explains, “It means power.”  So is the issue really about cultural superiority or is it about gaining an economic advantage?</p>
<p>Gregory Rodriguez, a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times, brings some insight to the latter argument. He writes that “ethnically designated neighborhoods areas are as much about marketing and branding… as they are about where people live, their actual New World turf or even ethnic pride.” Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it’s all about the moolah and getting a little more customer attention. We see this branding everywhere in Berkeley. Why else do you think the Tibetan shops sell more generic silk scarves than other non-ethnic shops?  </p>
<p>But is this necessarily a bad thing? With the economic downturn, I think not. Some may see this as using culture as a commodity rather than appreciating it as a priceless treasure.  Given the current circumstances, however, it seems like a good idea to use our distinct cultures to not only share cultural goods with people of other ethnicities, but to bring home some money to make ends meet. For the growing population of Bengalis, if sharing their tradition through food and clothing helps them maintain employment and feed the family, it is definitely something to consider. </p>
<p>It is not that the Bengalis are unable to do this now, as there are various Bengali-owned stores spread throughout the neighborhood, but it’s just not the same. It’s about having the name to market that brand to tourists as well as locals of different ethnic backgrounds. Furthermore, by adding in such a brand name area as “Little Bangladesh,” Bengalis may be able to attract Bengalis from other regions. The game is in the name, people.</p>
<p>Sounds great, right? That is, if the Koreans were willing to give up a bit of their territory to accommodate the growing population of Bengalis. It is true that the Koreans have invested a lot into building Koreatown into what it is now, a place with a lively atmosphere full of restaurants, theatres, clubs, and internet cafes. Yet even though Koreans do represent a significant percentage in this area, Koreatown has come to be known as one of the most diverse communities, with a growing number of Latinos, African-Americans, Armenians, and other groups. It is thus in the best interest of the Koreans to build unity with their fellow immigrants and other ethnic groups. Doing so will not only boost business, but also maintain a cooperative atmosphere within the community.</p>
<p>Having gone through the immigrant struggle themselves, it makes sense for Koreans to aid other segments of the population in pursuing the same opportunity to build a distinct space in new and unfamiliar grounds. After all, both groups share a similar experience. As the negotiations for the boundaries and even the idea of building a “Little Bangladesh” continue to be debated, it wouldn’t hurt Koreatown to show some solidarity toward a fellow immigrant community.</p>
