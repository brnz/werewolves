<p>The play 36 Views written by Naomi Iizuka, is a story full of deceit and self-deception. 
  It challenges the audience&#146;s expectations and perception of reality and 
  fantasy. </p>
<p>Darius Wheeler, played by Bill Camp, opens the play with his wild tales of 
  his travel in Southeast Asia. This avid Oriental art collector&#146;s exaggerated 
  gestures and tone accentuate his machismo and presumptuous attitude toward his 
  love interest, Setsujo Hearn, an art scholar. In the background, there are the 
  aspiring con-artists Claire Tsung, who creates ancient artwork and sells these 
  &#147;antiques&#148; to high bidders, and John Bell, who works for Wheeler and 
  tricks him into buying Tsung&#146;s artwork, the so-called Pillow Book. This 
  fake Pillow Book had supposedly changed the history of Asian antiquity. The 
  ending, however, surprises the audience when the twist and turns gradually come 
  together to form the bigger picture. </p>

            <p><img src="/images/hr_353.gif" width="353" height="3" alt="" border="0"></p>
      
  Rather than being intellectually enlightening, the play becomes superficial with 
  a heavy emphasis on the sex scenes and Hearn&#146;s appearance.

<p>The most interesting element of 36 Views is the interaction between the audience 
  and the play itself. Director Mark Wing-Davey does a great job placing the characters 
  closely to the audience in order to involve the latter in the story as well. 
  Characters such as Wheeler and Tsung often look directly to the crowd as they 
  are challenging the audience&#146;s perception of reality and fantasy. </p>
<p>The set also captures the audience attention scene after scene. Strong visual 
  contrasts such as traditional Japanese art versus contemporary art and constantly 
  moving props creates great entertainment. Set designer Douglass Stein uses the 
  sliding screens and floating panels to subtly create different worlds for the 
  characters. Also, the computer-generated projection captures the convergence 
  of eastern and western cultures, with the help of heavy Japanese rap in the 
  background. </p>
<p>While the technical aspect of 36 Views is eye-catching, it is its theme that 
  truly forces the audience to think critically and doubt their perception. Iizuka 
  tries to present the importance of dispensing our expectations and viewing life 
  from a different perspective. She challenges society&#146;s view toward the 
  Asian American woman as exotic and vulnerable. Setsujo Hearn portrays that stereotypical 
  image: sexy, weak, and intelligent. However, she is the exact opposite of what 
  the audience expects. She is not Japanese. She is born in China and raised in 
  Ohio by her adoptive parents. </p>
<p>The message the play delivers is clear but weak. It tries to be philosophical, 
  toying with western society&#146;s pervasive image of Asian American women. 
  Rather than being intellectually enlightening, the play becomes superficial 
  with a heavy emphasis on the sex scenes and Hearn&#146;s appearance. </p>
<p>Filled with art-speak, jargon and pillow-book poetry, Naomi Iizuka does succeed 
  in creating a visually entertaining play. In order to understand what the playwright 
  tries to present, the audience must not go to the theater as critics, but rather 
  as actors in the play. </p>
