<h2>misdirection and misinformation - the olympic torch's north american relay reduced to a cheap trick</h2></a>
by omar geoffrey narvaez

<p><b><i>Hundreds of protesters and supporters disappointed as growing political tensions surrounding the 2008 Summer Olympics prompt San Francisco City Officials and Olympic Games organizers to change the torch route to avoid conflicts.</i></b></p>

<p>Since 1928 the Olympic Torch has been a symbol for the unity, understanding and cooperation that the Olympic Games hope to garner within the different countries that come to compete. On April 9, the Olympic Torch came to San Francisco as part of the tradition of relaying the torch from Greece to the country where this year's Olympic Games will be held. The Beijing Olympics has stirred up much controversy from those who oppose the People's Republic of China's (PRC) foreign policies and human rights track record.</p><p>The very concept of the torch relay has its origins in controversy. Originally, the relay was not a part of the Games ceremony, but rather was introduced by Carl Diem and Joseph Goebbels to promote Nazi ideology during the 1936 Summer Olympics. From its conception the torch relay has had a political agenda, so the events that have unfolded for this year's Olympic Games are not surprising.</p><p>Before arriving in San Francisco, the Olympic Torch found its way through protesters in Paris who were successful in extinguishing the flame several times. In order to prevent a repeat of what happened in Paris, the torch route in San Francisco was changed at the last minute. As a result, hundreds of onlookers, both protesters and supporters of the torch relay alike, were disappointed as the torch disappeared and reappeared in what was a confusing, but apparently effective, method of misdirection. Originally supposed to be carried down the Embarcadero, the torch instead disappeared into a warehouse on Pier 48 at the beginning of the run. Protesters and supporters watched in confusion thirty minutes later as two new torch bearers emerged two miles away and made their way down Van Ness Avenue along a previously unannounced route, heavily guarded by local police and Olympic security. As a final precaution against protesters, the planned closing ceremony was cancelled and the torch made its way to the San Francisco International Airport where it made its hasty retreat.</p><p>Comical, ridiculous, deceptive, and disappointing are all words that come to mind when reflecting upon how city officials handled the turnout of pro-Tibet and other protesters. However, the entire incident begs the question: exactly how much of a political agenda do the Olympic Games necessarily have? While there are things about the PRC that are certainly worth protesting, are the Olympic Games and all of its associated events the proper venue for these protests?</p><p>For the Chinese American population in San Francisco, these questions have become a point of discussion in light of recent events. While some view the protests and boycotts against the Chinese government during the Olympic proceedings as inappropriate, others feel the need and the right to voice their opinions. Helen Zia, a prominent Chinese American civil rights activist, doesn't necessarily support everything that the Chinese government does, but recognizes the tremendous progress the country has made in becoming a member of the international community. Attorney Edward Liu and other Chinese Americans in the San Francisco community also view the torch's presence as an honor begetting a sense of ethnic pride. San Francisco marks the one and only stop in all of North America that the torch will make and reasonably, they view protests of the Games as an unnecessary politicization and an insult to the Chinese Americans that support the events.</p><p>On the other hand, the Olympics are publicized on an international scale making it the perfect venue for protesters to voice their opinions. The history of the Olympic Games is rife with politics and this year's Summer Games are no exception. Supporters of the Games choose to see the events in light of the Olympic ideals of friendly, international competition, and view protests as a means of furthering the distance between China and the United States. Protesters see the Games as an outrage and an opportunity to increase awareness about the problems that are existant in the China. While both sides are likely of the same opinion regarding the PRC, they differ on how to express their opinion and what salient points they choose to focus on.</p>
<p>Those in charge of the torch route, although well intentioned, essentially copped out and did not give the protesters their chance at media coverage. The political ramifications of having the Olympics in Beijing were unavoidable, and as these last few legs of the torch relay have made clear, show no signs of letting up. With tensions in Tibet approaching a fever pitch, it would be a blessing if this summer's Olympics went off without incident. </p>
