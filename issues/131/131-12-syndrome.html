<h2>The Connie Chung Syndrome </h2>
by ivonne ho

<p><b><i>The Absence of Asian American Males in News Broadcasting</i></b></p>
</p>
<p>
Chung initiated the boom of Asian American females’ entry in news media, with journalists such as Lisa Ling and Carol Lin as prominent successors. Lisa Ling, most notable as the co-host of ABC’s The View and investigative reporter for The Oprah Winfrey Show, is going to host her own talk show on the Oprah Winfrey Channel (to be launched in 2010). Carol Lin has paved a successful career in journalism as a news anchor and correspondent for ABC and CNN.
</p>
<p>
So, it is not surprising that this situation is dubbed the “Connie Chung Syndrome.” Asian American female news anchors are ubiquitous. It is not hard to find at least one in each major news broadcasting channel. But…WHERE ARE THE MEN?!

 
</p>
<p>
So often in the news we see the pairing of a white male and an Asian American female but never the opposite—Asian American male and white female. In 2002 USC’s Annenberg School of Communications conducted a research named “Asian Male Broadcasters on TV: Where Are They?” to study the low ratio of male broadcasters compared to female ones. Within the top 25 news markets, there are a total of 106 Asian American anchors—86 females and 20 males; in other words, 81% are women while only 19% are men. Even though this study was conducted seven years ago, not much seems to have changed since then. Perhaps these statistics resulted from the fact that viewers are so familiar with this combination that any change will disturb the status quo.

 
</p>
<p>
Let’s speculate on the different reasons that possibly contributed to the numbers above:

 
</p>
<p>
1.) White male dominance. The theory of “White Supremacy” isn’t just an idea of the past: it certainly exists today, albeit in a much less prevalent form. This mindset, which uplifts the white race while degrading the others, might be one of the barriers that prevent Asian American men from gaining more successful news broadcasting jobs. In this mostly white-dominant profession, it seems like Asian American males are only assigned to roles of either the weatherman or sports reporter. Do female women from a minority pose less of a threat on television than men from the same minority? Having more Asian American males as news anchors can be interpreted as raising the social status of Asian American males to that of white males, thus eliminating the superior status of white males in this industry. This view implies that the current status of Asian American men is lower than that of white males.

 
</p>
<p>
2.) Yellow fever may play a role in this rigid trend. After all, Connie Chung is married to Maury Povich. Yellow fever is the slang term describing white men’s fetish for Asian American females, exoticizing and objectifying them as stereotypical young, submissive, slim women. A mostly white news audience may have this attraction towards Asian American females and prefer them paired with white male anchors. At the same time yellow fever worships Asian American women, it tends to effeminate Asian American men. Often-times, Asian American men are seen as shy, awkward, and lacking masculinity; notice that all of these adjectives are negative. This type of socially damaging depiction of Asian American can be a harmful barrier that keeps them out of mainstream news media.

 
</p>
<p>
3.) No talent? And of course, some argue that Asian American men are not entering this field because there is a lack of talent. Really? I don’t think so. One clear example would be the gender ratio in my Media Studies class. About half the students are guys. To me, there is no obvious shortage of talent or interest in media from Asian American men. Richard Lui, a UC Berkeley graduate, is the first Chinese American male and only Asian American to anchor alone for the channel CNN Headline News.  Although his accomplishments are comparable to that of Connie Chung’s, Lui is still much less popular. The problem is that the dearth of Asian American anchormen seems to justify the unproven belief that they are not as qualified as white males to appear professionally on television and report the daily news.

 
</p>
<p>
Whatever the cause may be, no explanation is enough to justify this imbalanced gender ratio. Why can only Asian American females break through the racial barrier and enter the industry while Asian American males cannot experience the same? The disproportion definitely undermines the extent of Asian American representation in public media. It is necessary to keep balances in terms of race and sex.

 
</p>
<p>
So why does this all matter? It matters because it skews the image of Asian American males, making it appear as if they are not talented enough to become anchormen. It matters because the non-representation impedes Asian American males who want to be future news broadcasters from achieving their dreams. It matters because no one is doing anything about it.

</p>
<p>
Taking away Asian American males' opportunities to be news anchors is taking away the gender equality necessary for a group’s full representation. The Asian American community isn’t comprised only of women; men are an equally important part! We often advocate for gender equality in today’s society. We have achieved progress to some extent, but have we achieved equality between Asian American women and men? America, known as the “Land of Opportunity,” is not living up to its great name as we can witness through the many Connie Chungs and not enough Richard Lius. The lack of Asian American men in news media will continue to feed the stereotype that marginalizes Asian American men as outsiders not talented enough to make it on television. It is not that there aren’t any Asian American male anchors at all, but there should definitely be a lot more. Hopefully, bringing more Asian American men into the industry can cure the insidious infection of the Connie Chung Syndrome.</p>
