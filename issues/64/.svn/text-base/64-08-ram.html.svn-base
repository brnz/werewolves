    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> You can hear fire-crackers 
        explode in the streets and you can see a dragon adorned in rich colorful 
        fabrics prance along to the sounds of gongs and cymbals. The streets are 
        lined with red and gold ornaments and the shops entice you with &#8220;lucky&#8221; 
        foods to welcome the Chinese New Year. The air feels &#8220;busy&#8221; 
        and the aromas change with each step as the smells mingle from one thing 
        to everything. This is just the tradition, you think. But have you ever 
        wondered why these traditions are practiced from generation after generation? 
        The Chinese New Year has recently passed us, have you done all that you 
        can to keep your fortunes looking bright and are you ready to know what 
        this year of the ram has in store for you? Whether or not you&#8217;re 
        ready, by the year of the ram, it&#8217;s already been predicted and it&#8217;s 
        up to you to decide whether or not you want to believe it.<br>
        <br>
        Chinese New Year follows the lunar year calendar, based on the cycles 
        of the moon. This New Year fell on February 1st and traditionally the 
        celebration lasts for two weeks. According to Chinese myth, when Buddha 
        was about to depart from earth he requested that all the animals bid him 
        farewell. Of all the animals, 12 arrived as asked, thereby receiving the 
        honor of being designated a year. By Chinese beliefs, a person born in 
        each of the animal years will bear the personality traits of that animal. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For those born in 1919, 1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, the ram is 
        associated with the central direction (not north, south, east, or west) 
        which indicates the ram&#8217;s desire for peace and lack of taking sides. 
        The ram is also known for patience, creativity, compassion, and generosity. 
        However, rams are easily conquered by their emotions, making them subject 
        to high levels of pessimism. They find it difficult to work under pressure 
        and are prone to tension. Generally, good things come naturally for rams 
        since fortune and money are attracted to these gentle animals. <br>
        <br>
        The year of the ram denotes a profitable year for all of us. Life will 
        be more at peace and families will be kept at heart. Living at a more 
        relaxed pace, this is the best time for reconciliation or to heal past 
        wounds and regrets. It is a time for all of us to reflect on our lives 
        and find tranquility within. <br>
        <br>
        With the year ahead of us, we can only hope that all the ceremonies and 
        rituals will in fact bring us a favorable year. New Year&#8217;s Eve is 
        considered the most significant day to carry out ceremonies, which is 
        why most cities now promote the year with the Festival of Lanterns. This 
        festival is associated with the dragon dance, fire-crackers, food, and 
        red gold decorations. In historical China, it was common, especially in 
        agricultural societies, to believe that the dragon controlled water and 
        weather. By depicting a happy dragon dance, this is a sign of good weather 
        and therefore plentiful crops, which at the time was considered the major 
        source of luck and prosperity. The dragon has now come to be symbolized 
        with good luck and prosperity, as well as a noble creatures that ward 
        off the evil spirits. The explosions of the fire-crackers also serve to 
        dispel the evil spirits that invite hardships for the year. <br>
        <br>
        &#8220;I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the first Chinese New Year 
        celebrations came when the first immigrants came to this country,&#8221; 
        says Bill Ong Hing, professor of law and Asian Studies at UC Davis. One 
        of the earliest records of Chinese in America was documented in 1788, 
        when a former lieutenant, John Meares, exchanged trade between Canton 
        and the North American Pacific Coast. According to APA scholar Peter Kwong, 
        50 Chinese boarded with Meares on his way back to Nootka Sound, 200 miles 
        northwest of Vancouver. By 1880, the Chinese population grew in San Francisco 
        and this began the spread of Chinese culture. Although many Chinese celebrations 
        may vary according to religion or region, the underlying essence of the 
        traditions is one of peace and happiness for family and friends. May this 
        year bring such joy for you and your loved ones! </p>
