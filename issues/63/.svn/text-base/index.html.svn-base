      I was sitting in one of my rhetoric classes when a word popped up that I 
      thought was extremely interesting: praxis. Praxis is word referring to the 
      theoretical loops between theory and practice. Why would I be so interested 
      in this one word that I only found out about in my classical rhetoric class? 
      Does it have any meaning to our lives?<br>
      <br>
      Praxis has relevance to all of our lives. Every single day we learn about 
      various theories in our classes. Yet part of the educational experience 
      is going outside the classroom and getting involved with the community. 
      Finding the connection between both theory and practice is a difficult one; 
      nevertheless it must be consistent. Evaluating one&#8217;s work in the community 
      is part of a healthy process of recognizing broad social change.<br>
      <br>
      Educator and activist Glenn Omatsu examined the term praxis at a recent 
      2000 speech given to college and high school students in Southern California. 
      In this speech he challenged Asian/Pacific Islander youth to execute the 
      theme of praxis through building leadership where we consistently begin 
      to question, think, and act&#8212;and encourage others to do the same. He 
      brought up a very clear distinction between the mainstream model of leadership 
      and the grassroots model of leadership developed by community activists. 
      Glenn distinguished the grassroots model of leadership differently because 
      it emphasizes that EVERYONE CAN BE A LEADER. Leadership isn&#8217;t defined 
      by the acts people do on &#8220;special occasions&#8221; but rather through 
      how they live everyday. It encourages those in the community that the process 
      of questioning, thinking, and acting (praxis) is an &#8220;inseparable process&#8221; 
      that must be done simultaneously. Through this process we can envision a 
      world we want to see.<br>
      <br>
      So, what do we do? Glenn says it best:<br>
      <br>
      &#8220;If we understand leadership as responding to the challenges facing 
      us in everyday life, then we need to use every opportunity to speak out 
      against racism, to defend the rights of immigrants, to oppose sexism and 
      homophobia, to promote environmental justice, to build support for political 
      prisoners, to oppose police brutality, to uphold human rights, to support 
      struggles for sovereignty and against colonialism particularly the efforts 
      of native Hawaiians for self-determination, and to promote a spirit of international 
      solidarity for peoples&#8217; struggles around the world.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
      In a time where going to war with Iraq is the main priority of our current 
      political administration, where students of color continue to struggle on 
      campus to have our voices heard, in the midst of the vast labor and human 
      rights violations of the United States, from not having the 1999 Third World 
      Liberation Front demands met, and an increasingly lack of diversity amongst 
      students and faculty&#8212;we have our work cut out for us. And while there 
      are so many important problems we face we must remember how connected a 
      lot of the issues are. It&#8217;s one thing to be aware about all the stuff 
      happening in the community; it&#8217;s another thing to actually get up 
      and start building empowerment in our communities. Tomorrow is our world 
      to build, and it&#8217;s going to take a lot of time and energy. It&#8217;s 
      not going to change by all of us working on one singular issue and then 
      throwing up our hands saying, &#8220;We did our part!&#8221; We&#8217;re 
      going to need to figure out a way to bridge the gap and make our community 
      activism last and extend far beyond our college years. In the end, the inequality 
      and injustice will continue to exist in our society. It&#8217;s up to all 
      of us to not only keep folks oppressing us in check, but also those in our 
      own community. The biggest challenge we face is ourselves.<br>
      Praxis: question, think, and act.
