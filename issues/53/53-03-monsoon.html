<p><i>&#147;Life is such a comedy. No signal up there, but one down here.&#148;</i></p>
<p>Exclaims a frustrated P.K. Dube, the wedding planner in the highly anticipated 
  film, &#147;Monsoon Wedding.&#148; His cell phone breaks up mid-conversation 
  while he&#146;s flying atop the wedding tent, scrambling to get the wedding 
  party organized. This sets the picture of the anxious ambiance of the big wedding 
  that is about to occur. &#147;Monsoon Wedding,&#148; a beautiful film directed 
  and produced by critically acclaimed film-maker Mira Nair, depicts a Punjabi 
  family in the midst of preparing for a young woman&#146;s arranged betrothal 
  to an engineer from Houston, Texas. Nair tells a superb tale that encompasses 
  every facet of an Indian wedding and brilliantly delineates the intricacies 
  of this family. The themes and issues that are addressed in the film are universal 
  and produce a touching end. The wedding is not only a union of two strangers 
  but also a union of the family members and friends. This movie paints a beautiful 
  picture of the boundlessness of unconditional love.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most stressful situations can produce the funniest scenarios, 
  as is the case in Monsoon Wedding. As the movie opens up, the funny interactions 
  between the various family members, due to the stress of the fast-coming wedding, 
  introduces us to the close-knit Verma family and their extended family. But 
  as the film progresses, we learn of family secrets, desires, and problems. Each 
  character travels through their path of growth, and in the end, are able to 
  celebrate this momentous occasion together. This film has already won Best Film, 
  Golden Lion at the 2001 Venice International Film Festival, where it debuted. 
  It also received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2002 Golden 
  Globes. </p>
<p>Mira Nair began her career with a smash hit, Salaam Bombay. She was also the 
  director of Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love. She was born and raised in Delhi and 
  educated at Delhi University and Harvard University. Since 1947, Delhi has become 
  primarily a Punjabi populated city. She realized that the best celebration to 
  depict would be the most extravagant, blissful, and most family-oriented: a 
  Punjabi wedding. This film was shot by Declan Quinn on digital video. He captures 
  the most intimate and gorgeous shots of the city life and cityscape, illuminating 
  the actors on screen and creating beautiful thematic shots of flowers, lights, 
  and an abundance of beautiful colors. The screenplay was written by Sabrina 
  Dhawan, who grew up in New Delhi, India and studied in the graduate film program 
  at Columbia University. </p>
<p>The large cast was extremely talented and exuded a great chemistry together 
  on screen. The cast included one of India&#146;s greatest actors, Naseeruddin 
  Shah, who played the father of the bride. He portrays the caring father figure 
  with great presence, especially in the last few scenes, in which he is driven 
  to make an important decision for the sake of his family. Shah has acted in 
  over 120 movies, winning numerous awards. Other notable actors include Lillete 
  Dubey who plays the mother of the bride is a respected stage actress and theater 
  director. Shefali Shetty who plays the cousin of the bride, Ria is applauded 
  for her role in &#147;Satya,&#148; which won her an Indian Screen Award. She 
  delivers an excellent performance as the bride&#146;s cousin, who has to come 
  to terms with a secret she has kept from her family for years. The only disappointment 
  of the film was the lack of development of the lead character, the bride, Vasundhara 
  Das, who is trying to resolve an old love affair days before her wedding. Indeed 
  it wasn&#146;t really Nair&#146;s intention to focus on the bride and groom, 
  but on the dimensions of the family, which she is successful in doing.</p>
<p>Monsoon wedding is a film about the celebration of marriage, family, and love. 
  The influence of globalism and evidence of diaspora in India are greatly seen 
  in this film. This film unites the traditional and modern India. Nair tests 
  the strength of this family and they are given a beautiful conclusion. Nair 
  says, &#147;Monsoon Wedding freely invokes Bollywood conventions, musically 
  and visually. This is a Bollywood movie, made on my own terms. If the film captures 
  the mast- the intoxicating zest for life- of my people, then I will have done 
  my work.&#148; Monsoon Wedding does not only this but also invokes a zest for 
  life and the union of family in its audiences as well.</p>
