By the way, this video gets better at the two minute mark. When everything starts exploding.\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/WNSJnXyiEx4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/WNSJnXyiEx4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object>\n\nAnd next, we have a singer that I actually like, Se7en. However, he doesn't do himself any justice with his new song, \"Them Girls.\" Admittedly, it's catchy. Admittedly, there have been incredibly way worse songs. But I can't help giggling and laughing whenever I hear the lines \"You can Google me, baby!\" Oh man, Se7en. And the creepy intonations of \"GIRLS. GIRLS. GIRLS\" is enough to make me just die a little inside. This is him performing it live.\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/T1ZkENFQnps&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/T1ZkENFQnps&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object>\n\n\"Trying to make you my accessory, all girls are necessary!\"\n\nBut I mean, all awful lyrics aside, how successful will these two get? I mean, it's not like they lack money or talent (though that can be contested). But we've seen crashes and burns before.\n\nWill it result as badly as this? The moment I heard \"You're Easy Breezy and I'm Japanese-y,\" I knew Utada just couldn't make it here.\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/uBeWfIVKnSo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/uBeWfIVKnSo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object>\n\nWhat does it take for Asian artists to break into the American scene? Do they experience something incredibly more difficult than other foreign musicians? Probably. But I think it's largely because they need to improve their English... beyond the basics. You know, beyond repeating words like \"GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS\" and \"YUM YUM YUM.\" C'mon guys. If Asian Americans can hardly make it as musicians, I don't think you guys will have an easier time. You may need to put in a little more effort.\n\n(Though what's sad, is that Utada IS American.

In all honesty, the disappearance is largely attributed to my focus on my finals and being at home for winter break. In addition to that, I have been spending some time discussing with others from within the **hardboiled** core and other members of the Asian American community at Berkeley which direction to head from here. **Firstly, some things to address:** 1) **See community rules for posting. **Because of the multitude of comments that have been posted onto our blog unfiltered, providing no insightful commentary, the **hardboiled** core has decided to post rules for comments. All comments that do not adhere to these rules will be moderated. We deemed this important as to prevent spamming of our blog. Anonymous comments will continue to be allowed, however, it would be wise to leave a legitimate email address so that we may contact you, in case your comment does not follow our rules. Regulation will not occur retroactively, however. But be warned that from this moment onward, we will be following through with these regulations for our blog. 2) **In regards to my post.... **From the beginning, the intention of the entry was never to attack an individual for *being* a racist, but rather to note one of the many things that spurred me to feel disgusted towards acts of racism, hate speech, and hate crime. I took great care to conceal the identity of the owner of the album, because I felt it would take away from the purpose of the post. My point was not to direct attacks towards a person, but rather, to promote thought on hate speech and hate crime that continue today, despite a belief that our society has advanced and is no longer racist. It is worthy to note that this post was published a while ago: after the post was written, I took the initiative to talk with the person whose Facebook photo album I noted. The person themself noted that the photo album could be construed as racist, and agreed to take them down. The act, to me, was their acknowledgment that the photos were harmful and inappropriate. Racism appears in all sorts of forms and too frequently. However, I firmly believe in redemptive actions and that racist actions cannot be considered within a vacuum. Education should be the first steps we as a community should take in response to racism, instead of jumping towards condemnation and punishment. That may sound idealistic and naive, but it is a belief that I hold strongly. It is important that we as a community continue to strive to educate others as well as ourselves so that we can truly tolerate one another and create the cohesive APA community that for so long has been so divisive. However, it is also bad for us to let actions like this to continue. If education does not work, then the next step is to take more serious actions. Ignoring racism when it occurs is just as detrimental as being racist. I'm still admittedly naive and inexperienced, but I hope that these words are taken with weight 3) Although I'm pleased that the hardboiled blog has been getting more hits and has been receiving a lot more attention, I am largely disappointed with the reasons for this jump in activity. As many in the comments have cited, the post was condemning all forms of hatred, especially senseless hatred. Although racism is always terrible, fighting racism with further hateful speech perpetuates the problems and does not create meaningful solutions. So I, again, would like everyone to refer to the community rules that this blog will now be regulated by in order to prevent this sort of recklessness in the future Finally, I encourage anyone to contact me at [my email address,](elaineschen@gmail.com) in the chance that people feel personally offended by the things I said and would like to shoot some angry comments directed specifically at me. I do not regret the things I wrote, though I do regret the actions and hurt feelings that occurred around them. NOW, with all that being said, I hope people continue to visit this blog for future updates. Like I mentioned before, hopefully more of core will participate in blogging once finals are over and we're at home with nothing better to do than blog more!\n\n\n","html":"I know that I've been crucially missing from the discussion in a post that I wrote two months ago generally about racism, and I apologize for my inactivity. In all honesty, the disappearance is largely attributed to my focus on my finals and being at home for winter break. In addition to that, I have been spending some time discussing with others from within the <strong>hardboiled<\/strong> core and other members of the Asian American community at Berkeley which direction to head from here.\n\n<strong>Firstly, some things to address:<\/strong>\n\n1) <strong>See community rules for posting. <\/strong>Because of the multitude of comments that have been posted onto our blog unfiltered, providing no insightful commentary, the <strong>hardboiled<\/strong> core has decided to post rules for comments. All comments that do not adhere to these rules will be moderated. We deemed this important as to prevent spamming of our blog. Anonymous comments will continue to be allowed, however, it would be wise to leave a legitimate email address so that we may contact you, in case your comment does not follow our rules. Regulation will not occur retroactively, however. But be warned that from this moment onward, we will be following through with these regulations for our blog.\n\n2) <strong>In regards to my post.... <\/strong>From the beginning, the intention of the entry was never to attack an individual for <em>being<\/em> a racist, but rather to note one of the many things that spurred me to feel disgusted towards acts of racism, hate speech, and hate crime. I took great care to conceal the identity of the owner of the album, because I felt it would take away from the purpose of the post. My point was not to direct attacks towards a person, but rather, to promote thought on hate speech and hate crime that continue today, despite a belief that our society has advanced and is no longer racist.\n\nIt is worthy to note that this post was published a while ago: after the post was written, I took the initiative to talk with the person whose Facebook photo album I noted. The person themself noted that the photo album could be construed as racist, and agreed to take them down. The act, to me, was their acknowledgment that the photos were harmful and inappropriate.\n\nRacism appears in all sorts of forms and too frequently. However, I firmly believe in redemptive actions and that racist actions cannot be considered within a vacuum. Education should be the first steps we as a community should take in response to racism, instead of jumping towards condemnation and punishment. That may sound idealistic and naive, but it is a belief that I hold strongly. It is important that we as a community continue to strive to educate others as well as ourselves so that we can truly tolerate one another and create the cohesive APA community that for so long has been so divisive.\n\nHowever, it is also bad for us to let actions like this to continue. If education does not work, then the next step is to take more serious actions. Ignoring racism when it occurs is just as detrimental as being racist. I'm still admittedly naive and inexperienced, but I hope that these words are taken with weight\n\n3) Although I'm pleased that the hardboiled blog has been getting more hits and has been receiving a lot more attention, I am largely disappointed with the reasons for this jump in activity. As many in the comments have cited, the post was condemning all forms of hatred, especially senseless hatred. Although racism is always terrible, fighting racism with further hateful speech perpetuates the problems and does not create meaningful solutions. So I, again, would like everyone to refer to the community rules that this blog will now be regulated by in order to prevent this sort of recklessness in the future\n\nFinally, I encourage anyone to contact me at <a href=\"elaineschen@gmail.com\">my email address,<\/a> in the chance that people feel personally offended by the things I said and would like to shoot some angry comments directed specifically at me. I do not regret the things I wrote, though I do regret the actions and hurt feelings that occurred around them.\n\nNOW, with all that being said, I hope people continue to visit this blog for future updates. Like I mentioned before, hopefully more of core will participate in blogging once finals are over and we're at home with nothing better to do than blog more!","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":5,"created_at":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 15:13:20 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 05 Mar 2010 21:59:41 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 15:13:20 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":147,"title":"community rules for commenting","slug":"community-rules-for-commenting","markdown":"\n**purpose**: \u00a0In order to promote fair and meaningful discussion within our blog, please adhere to these community rules. \u00a0For all intents and purposes, **hardboiled** creates this online space for free expression, however, comments that hinder discussion will be moderated. **warnings**: \u00a0If your comment is discovered to violate the rules, we will email you with the email address provided. \u00a0If no action is taken to edit \/ remove your comment within 24 hours, the admin will effectively delete your comment. \u00a0You will still have posting privileges, however, comments which do not follow our guidelines will still be removed. **rules**: 1. **speak from personal experience\/use \"I\"**\u00a0 It is important to note that before making sweeping generalizations about anything and everything, you should consider that these thoughts were derived from your own experiences and may not apply to everyone.\n2. **focus on what is said, not on the person**\u00a0 Senseless personal attacks will not be tolerated. \u00a0In order to be constructive, focus attentions towards arguments and statements, rather than the person's character.\n3. **no spam! \u00a0**Please don't link out unless it's relevant. \u00a0If you want us to advertise your site, [contact us](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/contact\/), please, and you can discuss link exchanges. \u00a0And also, please don't Rick Roll us. \u00a0C'mon now. \u00a0We have a sense of humor, but there's a limit.\n\n\n","html":"<strong>purpose<\/strong>: \u00a0In order to promote fair and meaningful discussion within our blog, please adhere to these community rules. \u00a0For all intents and purposes, <strong>hardboiled<\/strong> creates this online space for free expression, however, comments that hinder discussion will be moderated.\r\n\r\n<strong>warnings<\/strong>: \u00a0If your comment is discovered to violate the rules, we will email you with the email address provided. \u00a0If no action is taken to edit \/ remove your comment within 24 hours, the admin will effectively delete your comment. \u00a0You will still have posting privileges, however, comments which do not follow our guidelines will still be removed.\r\n\r\n<strong>rules<\/strong>:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>speak from personal experience\/use \"I\"<\/strong>\u00a0 It is important to note that before making sweeping generalizations about anything and everything, you should consider that these thoughts were derived from your own experiences and may not apply to everyone.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>focus on what is said, not on the person<\/strong>\u00a0 Senseless personal attacks will not be tolerated. \u00a0In order to be constructive, focus attentions towards arguments and statements, rather than the person's character.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>no spam! \u00a0<\/strong>Please don't link out unless it's relevant. \u00a0If you want us to advertise your site, <a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/contact\/\">contact us<\/a>, please, and you can discuss link exchanges. \u00a0And also, please don't Rick Roll us. \u00a0C'mon now. \u00a0We have a sense of humor, but there's a limit.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 16:45:16 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 29 Dec 2011 04:39:40 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 29 Dec 2008 16:45:16 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":151,"title":"Issue 12.3 Is Now Uploaded!","slug":"issue-123-is-now-uploaded","markdown":"\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"350\" caption=\"Issue 12.3!\"][![Issue 12.3!](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/issues\/123\/cover123.gif \"Issue 12.3 Cover\")](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/issues\/123\/)[\/caption] Sorry for the delay, but I also wanted to announce that the website is [now updated with Issue 12.3](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/issues\/123\/)!

The movie was highly recommended by a good friend of mine who is a big-time movie buff so I went in this expecting it to be a pretty big deal... but it didn't quite deliver. First off, I do think it was cool that Clint Eastwood tried to develop a movie around the conflicts in a Hmong community. It's a pretty bold move for Eastwood to lend his star power to shed light on Hmong gang violence. But aside from the A for effort, the movie was pretty much a bust in my opinion. Would it really kill Hollywood to tell a story where a Hmong person was the one to resolve the conflict? Instead we get a snarling, macho, white guy (Walt Kowalski\/Eastwood) who saves the Hmong women and children from their own kind. Likewise, it irked me that a huge part of the plot was about Eastwood teaching Thao, the teenage Hmong boy, what it means to be a man. According to the movie, a real man drowns his conversations in a stream of curses, totes a big gun, and works in construction. I know that Eastwood is supposed to play a very grumpy and abrasive character but it's so overdone. Likewise, the interactions between Walt and Thao\/his sister Sue (played by Bee Vang and Ahney Her) were awkward and unnatural. Even after they become friends and Walt comes over to have a barbecue at their house, he continues to call them gooks and somehow it's supposed to be endearing... yeah, that doesn't usually do it for me. Although it's always good to have more Asian faces on the big screen, I'm still going to be critical of their acting abilities. True, they weren't working with the best script but Vang and Her's performances, to be honest, weren't all that hot. But hey, if nothing else, at least this movie has helped a few more people pronounce Hmong correctly (that silent \"h\" is a trickster). Agree or disagree?

The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends \u2014 hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism \u2014 these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility \u2014 a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.**This is the price and the promise of citizenship.**This is the source of our confidence \u2014 the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny. * It's encouraging to hear the new president talk about individual responsibility and the importance of every member of society to internalize those American values. Whereas we elect the people in government to do the work of organizing and managing people's lives, they are merely extensions of us. You can't be apathetic about politics, especially in this time! With our tumbling economy, a promise of policy upheavals and changes, and a shifting political ideology of the country... it's silly to think that you can just happily go through your day to day life ignorant of what goes on in Washington DC.

It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.<\/em>\n\n<em>Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends \u2014 hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism \u2014 these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility \u2014 a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.<\/em>\n\n<em>This is the price and the promise of citizenship.<\/em>\n\n<em>This is the source of our confidence \u2014 the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny. <\/em>\n\nIt's encouraging to hear the new president talk about individual responsibility and the importance of every member of society to internalize those American values. Whereas we elect the people in government to do the work of organizing and managing people's lives, they are merely extensions of us. You can't be apathetic about politics, especially in this time! With our tumbling economy, a promise of policy upheavals and changes, and a shifting political ideology of the country... it's silly to think that you can just happily go through your day to day life ignorant of what goes on in Washington DC.\n\nSo for all our folks out there reading this blog: Pick up the newspaper. Start a dialogue. Do something. Don't you dare be indifferent.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":5,"created_at":"Sun, 25 Jan 2009 19:30:43 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 05 Mar 2010 22:05:33 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 25 Jan 2009 19:30:43 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":214,"title":"HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR!","slug":"happy-chinese-new-year","markdown":"\n![](http:\/\/www.usps.com\/communications\/newsroom\/2009\/pr09_004.jpg \"ox stamp\")\u00a0 Did you know that 1 in 4\u00a0 people in the world celebrates the Lunar New Year? It was only recently did I learned that the so-called \"Chinese\" New Year is not just celebrated by the Chinese. Apparently, it is also celebrated in Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries in Southeast Asia. In my family, we celebrate the Chinese\u00a0New Year primarily by\u00a0feasting.\u00a0Because\u00a0I had to get back to school by sunday night, my family decided to celebrate\/feast on saturday. We had some delicious homemade [hot pot](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hotpot) for the main course and [tangyuan](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tangyuan) for dessert. As for the custom of receiving red envelopes, I can't remember the last time I got one of those. 2009 is the Year of the Ox. Speaking of which, did you know that President Obama was born in the Year of the Ox? (1961) According to the Chinese zodiac, people who are born under\u00a0the sign of the\u00a0Ox\u00a0are said to be hardworking, tolerant, persistent, and possess an innate ability to achieve great things. They are also truthful, sincere and rarely driven by financial gain. \u00a0So let's all hope that\u00a0President Obama really embodies these traits and make some positive changes to America. Lastly, I just want to briefly mention that the stamp that the\u00a0U.S. Postal Service has recently released in celebration of the Year of the Ox is designed by the Asian American stamp artist Kam Mak.\u00a0\u00a0Mak was born in Hong Kong, and in 1971, his family moved to New York City's Chinatown, where he grew up. He has been chosen to design the series of Chinese New Year stamps starting from 2008. Next\u00a0year is the Year of the Tiger, and New Year's\u00a0Day\u00a0will fall on February 14, 2010.

This past Sunday, police officers were called to a Berryessa neighborhood in San Jose after Brian Pham called to say that his mentally ill brother was making unprovoked attacks on the family. The call was made after Daniel cut his brother with a knife from throat to ear. Thereafter, the police arrived at the home. The family members shouted \"Don't shoot him-- he's mentally ill!\" In spite of this, the police tasered Daniel and shot him four to five times until he was dead. Clearly, this was a fragile and highly dangerous situation. Yes, the police needed to use force to prevent Daniel from hurting others but it is a fucking outrage that they would shoot a man with a knife to death. Menace or not, there is no way that it is justifiable for an officer to shoot someone to death when they are not armed with a gun. Police officers claim that they did not know that he was mentally ill but also state that they would have acted in the same way even with this knowledge. Some remorse, huh? There's plenty of talk about whether or not Daniel was on drugs-- can I just say that this is completely beside the point? It makes no difference if he was mentally ill or on drugs because we know that he clearly had problems. This is a mere distraction from the overt injustice taking place. The fact of the matter is that the police shot to kill a man who did not have a gun and are now calling it acceptable procedure. What absolutely tears me apart is the suffering and guilt that Daniel's family must be feeling right now. Daniel's father says that his brother, Brian, feels responsible for Daniel's death because he was the one who called the police. The family reports that the police have made no effort to contact the family, update them on the case, or make any gesture to express their condolences.

Still largely uncovered by campus press, here\u2019s an open letter from students of NYU\u2019s Asian\/Pacific\/American (A\/P\/A) department to the department\u2019s administration protesting a (currently shelved, but still very plausible) proposal to remove the A\/P\/A major\/minor programs and restructure them as concentrations instead:\n\n----\n\nApril 26, 2009\n\nDear Faculty and Staff of the A\/P\/A Studies Department:\n\nAs students deeply concerned with the future of Asian\/Pacific\/American (A\/P\/A) Studies, as well as other academic programs within the Social & Cultural Analysis (SCA) Department, we would like to address the tentative dismantling of the A\/P\/A major and minor program into a concentration.\n\nFirst, we are disappointed by the hasty and exclusive manner in which information was shared with the students who would be affected by this major decision. Potential students who would have spoken on behalf of this concern were unable to exercise agency due to logistical constraints. One week ago, Professor Lok Siu informed a select group of students interested in A\/P\/A Studies about a meeting on Friday, April 24, to discuss the \u201cfuture of A\/P\/A Studies.\u201d Unfortunately, it was not until the night before the meeting that three students discovered that the topic of discussion was in fact regarding the tentative dismantling of the A\/P\/A major and minor program. The short time-span between the point of discovery and the time of the meeting made it difficult to contact and disseminate this information to other concerned classmates. As students who are a part of SCA, we are asking:\n\n\uf0a7 Why was the informational meeting limited to only some A\/P\/A Studies students from Prof. Siu's class Friday afternoon?\n\n\uf0a7 Why wasn't there a town hall meeting for all SCA students?\n\nSCA taught us the necessity of critical analysis- challenging the status quo as opposed to passively abiding by the given set of rules and explanations of \u201cThe Man.\u201d Therefore, as critical students, we feel the obligation to question and challenge the inherent power structures, which everyone occasionally falls victim to. SCA is a unique department that prides itself in its deep historical inquiries and applied knowledge regarding modern developments. While we do acknowledge and esteem the transdisciplinary nature of SCA, we also believe it is crucial to provide an opportunity to focus on a specific discipline involved in the intersectional links we study. Without the option for a narrower focus, we believe it would be difficult to adequately study and address the issues relevant to these intersectional relations.\n\nSecond, at this meeting on Friday, a group of nine students learned that the \u201cSCA\u201d administration was considering the so-called alteration of not only the A\/P\/A major and program, but the other SCA programs as well. It was revealed that due to management issues, budgetary concerns and lack of student interest, \u201cSCA\u201d was therefore converting the A\/P\/A major and minor into a concentration. Students were assured that this action would not \u201cshrink\u201d the program and the number of course offerings.\n\nHowever, we find it difficult to believe that the A\/P\/A studies program would not eventually be downsized for the following reasons:\n\n\uf0a7 There are currently only four full-time faculty that teach in the A\/P\/A Studies Department, one of only whom is not teaching in any other department at NYU. If the current major and minor are eliminated, we are concerned that the A\/P\/A Studies would lose legitimacy as a program, making it difficult to hire new, permanent full-time faculty.  \n \uf0a7 Further consolidating all ethnic studies programs into one massive concentration could cause a scramble for already scarce resources among the SCA disciplines, rather than foster cooperation.  \n \uf0a7 If we allow A\/P\/A and other programs to be lumped into one massive category, we would be agreeing that all these minority groups are the same and don\u2019t need any specialized focus, but we know that, while our histories do overlap and intersect, we also have different stories. At a time when ethnic studies are undervalued on college campuses and by the general public, ethnic studies programs are even more prone to being marginalized in the hierarchies of university academia.\n\nThird, ** NYU always prides itself in being located in one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. However, by attempting to diminish the importance of ethnic studies and lumping the programs into one huge category, NYU would be reinforcing the same Eurocentric curriculum that our SCA classes have been teaching us to challenge all along. ** In doing so, the administration would be implying that the history and struggles of A\/P\/As, as well as other marginalized groups, are not important enough to be considered a real major. As students, we acknowledge the danger of a so-called post-racial society in an era which has seen the election of the United States' first Black president. In light of the general fear of addressing race in this country (under the assumption that racism doesn't exist anymore), we need specific ethnic studies classes as a safe haven to engage in that dialogue. **New York City is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for SCA\u2019s work, \u201cboth in its community orientation and its connections to global networks,\u201d according to principles of the department. It would be hypocritical of NYU to flaunt its multi-ethnic demographics while neglecting to tend to the needs of these populations.  \n**\n\nWe believe there is indeed a huge interest in establishing a space for dialogue specific to A\/P\/A history and issues. Just recently, on April 18, the 3rd annual NYC Asian American Student Conference (NYCAASC) brought together 350 students from around the NYC area onto NYU's campus to discuss and learn about issues pertinent to the A\/P\/A community. Students at the City University of Hunter College, for example, have been fighting hard to establish A\/P\/A Studies at their own school, similar to the ones at institutions such as NYU and Columbia University. **While the issues and knowledge of the history of A\/P\/As are widely overlooked in allof the United States, the East Coast, in contrast to the West, must address its relatively younger generation of Asian-Pacific Americans.**\n\nWe do not want to spend two pages stating the obvious problems with the elimination of our major and other majors in SCA. Instead, we want to focus our energy on strategies to strengthen the programs that are already established. The following suggestions and comments are based on the limited amount of information that we have as of this moment:\n\n\uf0a7 As students, we are committed to uphold the values that SCA & A\/P\/A promote. **We see a strong need to distinguish East Asian Studies and A\/P\/A Studies.**  \n \uf0a7 The A\/P\/A program needs more visibility on our campus. We believe that it is not a lack of student interest, but rather a lack of exposure to information. We should focus on a campaign to expose NYU students to the unique offerings of these different programs in SCA. One way is to advertise substantially during Welcome Week. Another way is to list A\/P\/A Studies as one of the majors that NYU offers, when brochures are sent to prospective students.  \n \uf0a7 In order to truly progress, we need to address present issues that are taking place. This can only happen if there are more course offerings and more professors. Following the 2008 Presidential Campaign, Professor Dent offered a course entitled, \"Deconstructing Obama.\" Likewise, the A\/P\/A Department should also provide course offerings responsive to student needs.  \n \uf0a7 It is important to **empower SCA students with knowledge and transparency.** For instance, none of the nine students on Friday knew about the A\/P\/A program budget for student development. **If students were involved from the very beginning, they would have been more likely to utilize those funds to help our program flourish.**\n\nOverall, we feel very strongly about the A\/P\/A program, and the last thing we want to see is its deterioration. We want to help it progress and grow stronger. By allowing our program to disintegrate, we would be going against the founding principles of the A\/P\/A Institute. We would like to thank you for your time and hope that we can work together to think of more ways to address this dire issue. Please continue to keep us involved in this dialogue.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJanice Liao, History, Art History, Subaltern Studies [Gallatin]  \n Joseph Lin, Social and Cultural Analysis (Asian\/Pacific\/American and Latino Studies)  \n Chi-Ser Tran, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies\n\nIn support:  \n Carina Don, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies & History  \n Michelle Geslani, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies & Journalism  \n Emerald Maravilla, Social & Cultural Analysis (A\/P\/A and Africana Studies)  \n Karen Yi, Social & Cultural Analysis (A\/P\/A and Latino Studies) & Journalism  \n Melissa Zhang, Psychology, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies\n\n3rd annual NYC Asian American Student Conference committee  \n NYU Asian Heritage Month committee  \n ---------------------- (Special props to my girl Chi-Ser Tran [NYU \u201909] for informing me of this situation and allowing me to reprint their letter. The highlighted portions are the words that elicited my strongest reactions and are my own editing.)  \n There\u2019s not much more information or commentary here, because right now all the students know about the situation are detailed in the letter above. Of course, this change to the SCA program would bring similar changes to other ethnic studies disciplines offered by the university. As a New York native raised in the NYU area who is thoroughly familiar with the evils of the university administration (especially upon neighboring communities), I find the hypocrisy behind heralding NYU\u2019s location for its diverse and cultural values while denying ethnic studies its proper recognition within academia absolutely abhorrent. This is especially true, considering that this would come as a blow to one of the better and more developed A\/P\/A study programs on the East Coast\u2014not that there were many to start with.\n\nRight now the decision is being postponed, but that still leaves this program vulnerable. With the recent graduation of the (as of this writing) only 3 A\/P\/A majors from the university, it\u2019s important we keep informed about our friends on the East Coast fighting the same good fight that we are (don\u2019t tell me any of that letter didn\u2019t sound familiar to you). I continue to be wholly impressed by the active role students are taking in the movement. Hopefully, with all the shit we need to get done at Berkeley, we can get more of this kind of leadership going.\n\nFight on, NYU kids.\n\n\n","html":"<p>\tAs evidenced by the date of the letter below, this is hella old news, and I deeply apologize for my tardiness on this exceedingly important issue.

In light of the general fear of addressing race in this country (under the assumption that racism doesn't exist anymore), we need specific ethnic studies classes as a safe haven to engage in that dialogue. <strong>New York City is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for SCA\u2019s work, \u201cboth in its community orientation and its connections to global networks,\u201d according to principles of the department. It would be hypocritical of NYU to flaunt its multi-ethnic demographics while neglecting to tend to the needs of these populations.<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We believe there is indeed a huge interest in establishing a space for dialogue specific to A\/P\/A history and issues. Just recently, on April 18, the 3rd annual NYC Asian American Student Conference (NYCAASC) brought together 350 students from around the NYC area onto NYU's campus to discuss and learn about issues pertinent to the A\/P\/A community. Students at the City University of Hunter College, for example, have been fighting hard to establish A\/P\/A Studies at their own school, similar to the ones at institutions such as NYU and Columbia University. <strong>While the issues and knowledge of the history of A\/P\/As are widely overlooked in allof the United States, the East Coast, in contrast to the West, must address its relatively younger generation of Asian-Pacific Americans.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We do not want to spend two pages stating the obvious problems with the elimination of our major and other majors in SCA. Instead, we want to focus our energy on strategies to strengthen the programs that are already established. The following suggestions and comments are based on the limited amount of information that we have as of this moment:<\/p>\n<p>\uf0a7\tAs students, we are committed to uphold the values that SCA &#038; A\/P\/A promote. <strong>We see a strong need to distinguish East Asian Studies and A\/P\/A Studies.<\/strong><br \/>\n\uf0a7\tThe A\/P\/A program needs more visibility on our campus. We believe that it is not a lack of student interest, but rather a lack of exposure to information. We should focus on a campaign to expose NYU students to the unique offerings of these different programs in SCA. One way is to advertise substantially during Welcome Week. Another way is to list A\/P\/A Studies as one of the majors that NYU offers, when brochures are sent to prospective students.<br \/>\n\uf0a7\tIn order to truly progress, we need to address present issues that are taking place. This can only happen if there are more course offerings and more professors. Following the 2008 Presidential Campaign, Professor Dent offered a course entitled, \"Deconstructing Obama.\" Likewise, the A\/P\/A Department should also provide course offerings responsive to student needs.<br \/>\n\uf0a7\tIt is important to <strong>empower SCA students with knowledge and transparency.<\/strong> For instance, none of the nine students on Friday knew about the A\/P\/A program budget for student development. <strong>If students were involved from the very beginning, they would have been more likely to utilize those funds to help our program flourish.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Overall, we feel very strongly about the A\/P\/A program, and the last thing we want to see is its deterioration. We want to help it progress and grow stronger. By allowing our program to disintegrate, we would be going against the founding principles of the A\/P\/A Institute. We would like to thank you for your time and hope that we can work together to think of more ways to address this dire issue. Please continue to keep us involved in this dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n<p>Janice Liao, History, Art History, Subaltern Studies [Gallatin]<br \/>\nJoseph Lin, Social and Cultural Analysis (Asian\/Pacific\/American and Latino Studies)<br \/>\nChi-Ser Tran, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies<\/p>\n<p>In support:<br \/>\nCarina Don, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies &#038; History<br \/>\nMichelle Geslani, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies &#038; Journalism<br \/>\nEmerald Maravilla, Social &#038; Cultural Analysis (A\/P\/A and Africana Studies)<br \/>\nKaren Yi, Social &#038; Cultural Analysis (A\/P\/A and Latino Studies) &#038; Journalism<br \/>\nMelissa Zhang, Psychology, Asian\/Pacific\/American Studies<\/p>\n<p>3rd annual NYC Asian American Student Conference committee<br \/>\nNYU Asian Heritage Month committee<br \/>\n\n----------------------\n\n(Special props to my girl Chi-Ser Tran [NYU \u201909] for informing me of this situation and allowing me to reprint their letter. The highlighted portions are the words that elicited my strongest reactions and are my own editing.)<br \/>\n\n\tThere\u2019s not much more information or commentary here, because right now all the students know about the situation are detailed in the letter above. Of course, this change to the SCA program would bring similar changes to other ethnic studies disciplines offered by the university. As a New York native raised in the NYU area who is thoroughly familiar with the evils of the university administration (especially upon neighboring communities), I find the hypocrisy behind heralding NYU\u2019s location for its diverse and cultural values while denying ethnic studies its proper recognition within academia absolutely abhorrent. This is especially true, considering that this would come as a blow to one of the better and more developed A\/P\/A study programs on the East Coast\u2014not that there were many to start with.<\/p>\n<p>Right now the decision is being postponed, but that still leaves this program vulnerable. With the recent graduation of the (as of this writing) only 3 A\/P\/A majors from the university, it\u2019s important we keep informed about our friends on the East Coast fighting the same good fight that we are (don\u2019t tell me any of that letter didn\u2019t sound familiar to you). I continue to be wholly impressed by the active role students are taking in the movement. Hopefully, with all the shit we need to get done at Berkeley, we can get more of this kind of leadership going.<\/p>\n<p>Fight on, NYU kids. <\/p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":14,"created_at":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 16:20:49 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 05 Mar 2010 21:51:12 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 19 Jun 2009 16:20:49 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":413,"title":"Internet Aiding Cases in China","slug":"internet-aiding-cases-in-china","markdown":"\n![dengyujiao](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/dengyujiao.jpg \"dengyujiao\")\n\n The New York Times published [this article](http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/06\/17\/world\/asia\/17china.html?_r=2) on 21-year-old Deng Yujiao who fought sexual assault by fatally stabbing her attacker, a local government official.\u00a0 > As she described it to a lawyer, Ms. Deng was a waitress in a karaoke parlor in rural Badong County, a Hubei Province backwater along the Yangtze River.

Today in the Daily Cal, sandwiched next to articles covering yesterday's [walkout ](http:\/\/www.ucstudentwalkout.com\/) was a column titled [ \"Embrace Your Inner Azn (sic)\" ](http:\/\/www.dailycal.org\/article\/106788\/embrace_your_inner_azn) Basically the writer, Eden Pang, writes about how \"embarrassing\" it is to be identified as \"Azn\", as if there are a number of negative connotations behind liking Hello Kitty or posing for pictures with peace signs. In the column, she mentions how she wanted to be noticed by her caucasian peers as an equal (i.e. by having parents play in country clubs and eat deviled egg sandwiches) but at the end, has a realization that deep down inside, she is \"Azn\", that she too likes Sanrio products and big bubbly writing. Honesty, she shouldn't be embarrassed by girls who enjoy Asian paraphernalia; we should be embarrassed by people like her who draw on superficial features as salient measures of identity. I see no real difference in her article and the numerous video postings on Youtube on \"how to be a fob\". **Monte's take**: Wow, an azn hater. I didn't even realize the concept of being \"azn\" had escaped middle school but wow, here it is. Are you kidding me? This girl isn't embarassed of her own race? Nobody who respects her own culture would spend 2\/3 of an article spewing hate on it, and then spend the last 1\/3 reconciling with it. First off, being \"azn\" shouldn't be classified as emoticon loving, peace sign waving, hello-kitty loving people. If that's being \"azn,\" a subgroup of \"asian,\" then I know too many confused white people. Emotions, hello-kitty, and peace signs are all pretty popular cultural norms that deserve respect in their own right, not hate. I personally don't care for hello-kitty, but I certainly do not judge others for doing so. I don't understand where this concept came that the aforementioned traits are \"embarrassing.\" I think what's embarrassing is being on a newspaper staff belonging to the most prestigious public university in the world and having the audacity to publish an article that reinforces stereotypes. This article tries to redeem itself at the end saying it embraces \"azn,\" but it really doesn't. It just reconciles it. There is no celebration of culture, and what's especially sad is that there's so much more to Asian American culture that is never mentioned ); ** Cecilia's Take**: **what.the.hell**. I think a part of my soul just shriveled up and died after reading this. First off, Daily Cal, when did self-deprecation, cultural ignorance, and general ludicrousness become news? Pang begins by saying it's ridiculous for her to hide her oh-so-embarrassing Asian-ness because of her \"squinting eyes\" and ethnic last name, as if she's tainted and marked as inferior. Internalized racism much? More than being angry at her, I'm incredibly disturbed by the fact that she just doesn't get it. Even when she embraces her \"azn\" side, she still speaks about Asian identification as a disorder or illness that cannot be suppressed in spite of desires to absorb mainstream American norms to remedy her internal handicap. What really gets me though is a certain retort that follows someone's comment that the writer should take an Asian Am class: \"Don't you know the saying \"When in Rome, do as the Romans?\" Being azn is cute.. IN ASIA. Being an American-born azn IS NOT. How is flashing the peace sign in photos a part of Asian culture? Um, what? And what in the WORLD does Asian American studies have to do with anything? How would Asian AMERICAN studies help??\" Um I don't know, generate some sort of intellectual thought on racism and identity? Thank God for alternative media is all I can say. **Denise\u2019s Take: **Playing on Cecilia\u2019s aformentioned \u201cdisease\u201d metaphor, I really feel that this author\u2019s discomfort with her identity is the result of a misdiagnosis. \u201cAsianness\/Aznness\u201d is not a virulent disease-like state that can only be \u201clived with\u201d; however, idiocy and ignorance are. But I\u2019ll refrain from being as mean as I\u2019d like to be; while Pang\u2019s uninformed, judgmental generalizations of \u201cAzns\u201d and her self-deprecating fear of being judged are indubitably HILARIOUS, they are also tremendously tragic. The quality of this piece\u2019s writing as well as the mention of a \u201cdorm room\u201d at the end of the article already suggest the author\u2019s youth, and it may be possible that she comes from somewhere where poorly-crafted, racist vitriol is tolerated or even considered funny. No biggie. Humans make mistakes to learn, and it may just be incredibly unfortunate that this one was racist, horrid, and made many people feel very, very sad for society (especially that rather distasteful remark about the Wah Ching Gang. Classy!).\n\nThe real culprit is whatever idiot at The Daily Cal who thought this was appropriate to publish. This was essentially the only piece in this issue that did not have to deal with the walkout\u2013really? Of everything in the world to have an opinion about aside from the walkout, the only one worth publishing was this sophomorically written regurgitation of antiquated stereotypes. This is absolutely pathetic that The Daily Cal thought this passes off for news, or even intellectual thought worth representing at this university. Maybe this was an attempt to join the illustrious ranks of such schools as\u00a0[Yale](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/issues\/126\/126-5-tune.html) and\u00a0[Dartmouth](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/issues\/125\/125-3-dartmouth.html) in terms of unfunny, anti-Asian \u201csatire\u201d \u00a0(disclaimer: I realize that the vast majority of students at Yale and Dartmouth are probably far more intelligent than the perpetrators of those two articles). In any case, it\u2019s a particular slap in the face,considering the complete lack of discussion on how the budget cuts will affect API students outside of API spaces.

In the column, she mentions how she wanted to be noticed by her caucasian peers as an equal (i.e. by having parents play in country clubs and eat deviled egg sandwiches) but at the end, has a realization that deep down inside, she is \"Azn\", that she too likes Sanrio products and big bubbly writing.\n\nHonesty, she shouldn't be embarrassed by girls who enjoy Asian paraphernalia; we should be embarrassed by people like her who draw on superficial features as salient measures of identity. I see no real difference in her article and the numerous video postings on Youtube on \"how to be a fob\".\n\n<strong>Monte's take<\/strong>: Wow, an azn hater. I didn't even realize the concept of being \"azn\" had escaped middle school but wow, here it is. Are you kidding me? This girl isn't embarassed of her own race? Nobody who respects her own culture would spend 2\/3 of an article spewing hate on it, and then spend the last 1\/3 reconciling with it. First off, being \"azn\" shouldn't be classified as emoticon loving, peace sign waving, hello-kitty loving people. If that's being \"azn,\" a subgroup of \"asian,\" then I know too many confused white people. Emotions, hello-kitty, and peace signs are all pretty popular cultural norms that deserve respect in their own right, not hate. I personally don't care for hello-kitty, but I certainly do not judge others for doing so. I don't understand where this concept came that the aforementioned traits are \"embarrassing.\" I think what's embarrassing is being on a newspaper staff belonging to the most prestigious public university in the world and having the audacity to publish an article that reinforces stereotypes. This article tries to redeem itself at the end saying it embraces \"azn,\" but it really doesn't. It just reconciles it. There is no celebration of culture, and what's especially sad is that there's so much more to Asian American culture that is never mentioned );\n<strong>\nCecilia's Take<\/strong>: <strong>what.the.hell<\/strong>. I think a part of my soul just shriveled up and died after reading this. First off, Daily Cal, when did self-deprecation, cultural ignorance, and general ludicrousness become news? Pang begins by saying it's ridiculous for her to hide her oh-so-embarrassing Asian-ness because of her \"squinting eyes\" and ethnic last name, as if she's tainted and marked as inferior. Internalized racism much? More than being angry at her, I'm incredibly disturbed by the fact that she just doesn't get it. Even when she embraces her \"azn\" side, she still speaks about Asian identification as a disorder or illness that cannot be suppressed in spite of desires to absorb mainstream American norms to remedy her internal handicap. What really gets me though is a certain retort that follows someone's comment that the writer should take an Asian Am class: \"Don't you know the saying \"When in Rome, do as the Romans?\" Being azn is cute.. IN ASIA. Being an American-born azn IS NOT. How is flashing the peace sign in photos a part of Asian culture? Um, what? And what in the WORLD does Asian American studies have to do with anything? How would Asian AMERICAN studies help??\" Um I don't know, generate some sort of intellectual thought on racism and identity? Thank God for alternative media is all I can say.\n<p style=\"margin-top: 1.2em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><strong>Denise\u2019s Take: <\/strong>Playing on Cecilia\u2019s aformentioned \u201cdisease\u201d metaphor, I really feel that this author\u2019s discomfort with her identity is the result of a misdiagnosis. \u201cAsianness\/Aznness\u201d is not a virulent disease-like state that can only be \u201clived with\u201d; however, idiocy and ignorance are. But I\u2019ll refrain from being as mean as I\u2019d like to be; while Pang\u2019s uninformed, judgmental generalizations of \u201cAzns\u201d and her self-deprecating fear of being judged are indubitably HILARIOUS, they are also tremendously tragic. The quality of this piece\u2019s writing as well as the mention of a \u201cdorm room\u201d at the end of the article already suggest the author\u2019s youth, and it may be possible that she comes from somewhere where poorly-crafted, racist vitriol is tolerated or even considered funny. No biggie. Humans make mistakes to learn, and it may just be incredibly unfortunate that this one was racist, horrid, and made many people feel very, very sad for society (especially that rather distasteful remark about the Wah Ching Gang. Classy!).<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 1.2em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;\">The real culprit is whatever idiot at The Daily Cal who thought this was appropriate to publish. This was essentially the only piece in this issue that did not have to deal with the walkout\u2013really? Of everything in the world to have an opinion about aside from the walkout, the only one worth publishing was this sophomorically written regurgitation of antiquated stereotypes. This is absolutely pathetic that The Daily Cal thought this passes off for news, or even intellectual thought worth representing at this university. Maybe this was an attempt to join the illustrious ranks of such schools as\u00a0<a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #b8860b; border: 0px initial initial;\" href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/issues\/126\/126-5-tune.html\">Yale<\/a> and\u00a0<a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #b8860b; border: 0px initial initial;\" href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/issues\/125\/125-3-dartmouth.html\">Dartmouth<\/a> in terms of unfunny, anti-Asian \u201csatire\u201d \u00a0(disclaimer: I realize that the vast majority of students at Yale and Dartmouth are probably far more intelligent than the perpetrators of those two articles). In any case, it\u2019s a particular slap in the face,considering the complete lack of discussion on how the budget cuts will affect API students outside of API spaces.

Make sure you get your message to the chancellor by emailing him directly at robertjb@berkeley.edu Here is what I wrote: --- Dear Chancellor Birgeneau, My name is Cecilia Tran. I am an academic caseworker from the Student Advocate Office as well as a former editor of the campus Asian Pacific American newsmagazine. While in many ways I think the occupation of Wheeler was a flawed form of protest, it truly indicates the extreme isolation students have felt as our futures have been decided for us without a shadow of transparency or democratic process. Did I think this method of protest would make a single UC regent reconsider the fee hikes? Not for a moment. At the same time, I have come to the realization that all of our student actions, whether they are perceived to be acceptable forms of protest or not, have fallen on deaf ears. Although I came to UC Berkeley to be empowered by a world-class education, I have never felt so powerless. I feel disempowered when I read emails in which you claim to be in solidarity with us, yet do not provide an actual space or means for students to collaborate on solutions.

Make sure you get your message to the chancellor by emailing him directly at robertjb@berkeley.edu\n\nHere is what I wrote:\n\n---\nDear Chancellor Birgeneau,\n\nMy name is Cecilia Tran. I am an academic caseworker from the Student Advocate Office as well as a former editor of the campus Asian Pacific American newsmagazine.\n\nWhile in many ways I think the occupation of Wheeler was a flawed form of protest, it truly indicates the extreme isolation students have felt as our futures have been decided for us without a shadow of transparency or democratic process. Did I think this method of protest would make a single UC regent reconsider the fee hikes? Not for a moment. At the same time, I have come to the realization that all of our student actions, whether they are perceived to be acceptable forms of protest or not, have fallen on deaf ears. Although I came to UC Berkeley to be empowered by a world-class education, I have never felt so powerless.\n\nI feel disempowered when I read emails in which you claim to be in solidarity with us, yet do not provide an actual space or means for students to collaborate on solutions.

Nonetheless, I saw [this story about Chinese tenant evictions in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood on Angry Asian Man](http:\/\/cbs5.com\/local\/north.beach.evictions.2.1427811.html), and absolutely HAD to comment on it. It's concomitantly amusing and infuriating how blatantly racist this MacDonald noob is; I'm starting to believe it's actually a bit refreshing how he, unlike others who deny their efforts are racist, is actually coming out and admitting he's a big fat racist. Some gems from the article: 1) \"MacDonald said he doesn't think anybody will end up on the street, because he believes the renters' families will help. 'That's why we have families. If these people are as old as you say they are, then they have 2, 3 generations younger than them. I meet these people - you went to school with these people - they're brain surgeons. Okay? These are Asian Americans. they're smart, hard-working industrial people, addicted to the acquisition of real estate,' MacDonald said. When CBS 5 pointed out that MacDonald appeared to have generalized, painted with a broad brush, he said, 'I have. I'm just a private person, not a politician.'\" No, Mr. MacDonald, you're not a politician. But that doesn't mean you're not a public figure, making a public case against these tenants, and giving an interview that may largely sway public opinion because you're the primary attorney working on this case and thus we trust you. And thus the fact that you're not a politician justifies the fact that you're backing up your case with egregious generalizations based on the tenants' race. Props, though, for owning up the bigoted flaws in your argument. |\\\/|0|)31 |\\\/|||\\|0R|7|35 F7W!!!!!1one Also, what's with characterizing Asians as smart, hardworking, and \"addicted to the acquisition of real estate\"?? This to me is highly reminiscent of the whole Yellow Peril, the Chinaman is conspiring to take our California, pre-Chinese Exclusion crap, but maybe I'm just imagining things (maybe?). 2) \"'There are only about three counties out of 60-something in California that give anything more than a 30-day notice,' said MacDonald. 'If we were in Daly City - if they were 110 years old - they would just get a 30-day notice. They don't get $15,000 in relocation money...How is it unfair for us to give $25,000 to move? The rest of the country, almost the entire state of California would be shocked that you have to pay somebody to move out of your building.'\" Ah, yes, one of the oldest tricks in the book. Take the attention off how fucked up your actions are by comparing it to \"the rest of the country,\" thus making yourself look comparatively egalitarian. You're so cool, bro. 3) This last one is not from MacDonald but from the similarly-named Brett McDonald, a resident: \"North Beach, a densely populated neighborhood full of nightclubs and cafes struggles for parking spots, so the concept of restricting parking is not entirely popular, said Brent McDonald who lives on Jasper Alley. 'Pandering to the tenant lobby,' said Brent McDonald who lives on Jasper Alley. 'It's the sacrifice of the many for the benefit of the few,' said McDonald. 'Many people in North Beach may wish to put in a garage but can't now because of relatively few Ellis Act evictions.'\" And by \"the many,\" you mean \"those with money?\" You advocate clearing out longtime and ostensibly lower-income tenants to make room for parking spots, which cater to patrons of the \"nightclubs and cafes\" in North Beach. Nightclubs and cafes, textbook examples of gentrifying businesses. The elephant's in the room, at least own up to your bias. Sadly, these evictions seem to be legal under the Ellis Act, but I definitely agree with the dude quoted in the article that times are rough, and policy changes are badly needed. Nevertheless, congratulations for being completely fail.\n\n\n","html":"Yes, the fact that the rights of tenants of color (particularly low-income tenants, and Asian American tenants) are being disrespected in various ethnic enclaves undergoing gentrification is about as nascent knowledge as that the world is round or that humans were preceded by dinosaurs (hehe.). Nonetheless, I saw <a href=\"http:\/\/cbs5.com\/local\/north.beach.evictions.2.1427811.html\">this story about Chinese tenant evictions in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood on Angry Asian Man<\/a>, and absolutely HAD to comment on it.\r\n\r\nIt's concomitantly amusing and infuriating how blatantly racist this MacDonald noob is; I'm starting to believe it's actually a bit refreshing how he, unlike others who deny their efforts are racist, is actually coming out and admitting he's a big fat racist. Some gems from the article:\r\n\r\n1) \"MacDonald said he doesn't think anybody will end up on the street, because he believes the renters' families will help.\r\n\r\n'That's why we have families. If these people are as old as you say they are, then they have 2, 3 generations younger than them. I meet these people - you went to school with these people - they're brain surgeons. Okay? These are Asian Americans. they're smart, hard-working industrial people, addicted to the acquisition of real estate,' MacDonald said.\r\n\r\nWhen CBS 5 pointed out that MacDonald appeared to have generalized, painted with a broad brush, he said, 'I have. I'm just a private person, not a politician.'\"\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. MacDonald, you're not a politician. But that doesn't mean you're not a public figure, making a public case against these tenants, and giving an interview that may largely sway public opinion because you're the primary attorney working on this case and thus we trust you. And thus the fact that you're not a politician justifies the fact that you're backing up your case with egregious generalizations based on the tenants' race. Props, though, for owning up the bigoted flaws in your argument. |\\\/|0|)31 |\\\/|||\\|0R|7|35 F7W!!!!!1one\r\n\r\nAlso, what's with characterizing Asians as smart, hardworking, and \"addicted to the acquisition of real estate\"?? This to me is highly reminiscent of the whole Yellow Peril, the Chinaman is conspiring to take our California, pre-Chinese Exclusion crap, but maybe I'm just imagining things (maybe?).\r\n\r\n2) \"'There are only about three counties out of 60-something in California that give anything more than a 30-day notice,' said MacDonald. 'If we were in Daly City - if they were 110 years old - they would just get a 30-day notice. They don't get $15,000 in relocation money...How is it unfair for us to give $25,000 to move? The rest of the country, almost the entire state of California would be shocked that you have to pay somebody to move out of your building.'\"\r\n\r\nAh, yes, one of the oldest tricks in the book. Take the attention off how fucked up your actions are by comparing it to \"the rest of the country,\" thus making yourself look comparatively egalitarian. You're so cool, bro.\r\n\r\n3) This last one is not from MacDonald but from the similarly-named Brett McDonald, a resident:\r\n\r\n\"North Beach, a densely populated neighborhood full of nightclubs and cafes struggles for parking spots, so the concept of restricting parking is not entirely popular, said Brent McDonald who lives on Jasper Alley.\r\n\r\n'Pandering to the tenant lobby,' said Brent McDonald who lives on Jasper Alley.\r\n\r\n'It's the sacrifice of the many for the benefit of the few,' said McDonald. 'Many people in North Beach may wish to put in a garage but can't now because of relatively few Ellis Act evictions.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd by \"the many,\" you mean \"those with money?\" You advocate clearing out longtime and ostensibly lower-income tenants to make room for parking spots, which cater to patrons of the \"nightclubs and cafes\" in North Beach. Nightclubs and cafes, textbook examples of gentrifying businesses. The elephant's in the room, at least own up to your bias.\r\n\r\nSadly, these evictions seem to be legal under the Ellis Act, but I definitely agree with the dude quoted in the article that times are rough, and policy changes are badly needed.

of <strong>hardboiled<\/strong>: apa journalism is to provide students with an introduction to Asian Pacific American (APA) print journalism through the actual hands-on experience of participating in the production and distribution of an APA newsmagazine.\u00a0 In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, students will research and develop story ideas, compose layouts, and distribute issues to students, faculty, and community members.\u00a0 Students will participate in weekly workshops that cover topics including APA history, health in the APA community, APAs in law and politics, and APAs in the media as well as current and pertinent issues on campus, and in the local, national, and international community (refer to the calendar attached for a tentative list of the workshops).\u00a0 Students will receive an introduction to the local and campus Asian Pacific American communities by providing them with opportunities to meet community leaders, by attending and participating in community organizations and events, and by being a part of UC Berkeley\u2019s Asian Pacific American Coalition, a coalition of APA organizations on campus.\u00a0 <strong>hardboiled<\/strong> not only produces over 3,400 copies per semester of a professional newsmagazine covering relevant, timely, and insightful topics for the campus and greater community, but also provides staff with a community of like-minded students active in the APA community to learn about issues and engage in meaningful discussion.\u00a0 At the conclusion of the course, students will have learned the ins and outs of print journalism, increased their political awareness of APA issues, and received experience working within the APA community.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the

A quick summary of events thus far: On March 10th, some Buddhist monks demonstrated in Lhasa (the capital of Tibet). This has sparked off ongoing anti-Chinese rioting in Lhasa and surrounding provinces by ethnic Tibetans. So far, some 20 people have been killed and many more injured. Unkind words have been said by both sides with the Chinese accusing of the Dalai Lama of trying to ruin the Olympic Games, the Dalai Lama saying \"cultural genocide\" has occurred. And as always, the West tip toes haphazardly in between. To many in the Western audience, the Tibetan \"struggle for independence\" is a battle of good versus evil, of a lost peoples crying out for the loss of their peace loving spiritual leader. As much as the Western audience loves a story of absolute good triumphing over absolute evil, our common sense and indeed our common responsibility impel us to devote at least a couple of minutes to dig a little deeper. Before hunkering down (or up?) in a tree with \"Free Tibet!\" signs, let's be clear about what may or may not ground that support. First off, some Tibetan Buddhism 101. Buddhism came to Tibet in the 3rd century from India, and since then has developed unique characteristics including an emphasis on shamanism and rituals borrowed Bon (the actual native Tibetan religion). *Lama* simply refers to a honored Buddhist teacher. The *Dalai Lama*, however, serves the functional role of a Bodhisattva, or an enlightened being who has postponed nirvana to help guide others along the path to enlightenment. The catch-all term \"Tibetan Buddhism\" is a misnomer because there are have been numerous sects and sub-sects historically and which still exist in current practice. Furthermore, there are a minority of Tibetans who adhere to Islam, Hinduism, Bon and Christianity whom conveniently are never mentioned. Only one sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the Gelugpa tradition (the newest and most popular), claims the Dalai Lama as its spiritual head. Gelugpa school came to be dominant after its leaders gained political supremacy in the 17th century. The struggle to define Tibetan Buddhism and indeed control Tibet always has been and I dare say always will be, a political struggle. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, claims to be the 14th physical reincarnation of the original Dalai Lama, Gedun Drub, who lived from 1391-1474. Pause for second to think about what that actually means. It is saying that Tenzin Gyatso is actually the exact same person as Gedun Drub who was alive some 600 years ago. What's more interesting to me though is the process of determining the next Dalai Lama. Upon the death of a Dalai Lama, it is the responsibility of the High Lamas (basically the highest ranking monks) of the Gelugpa school to find his reincarnation in a male child born around the same time as the death. Traditionally there have been several ways the High Lamas have been able to find the boy. One of the High Lamas may have a dream, they may follow the smoke from the cremation of the previous Dalai Lama or go to a holy lake, Lhamo Lhatso in Central Tibet, for a vision or sign. In fact it was by this last method, a vision from this lake, that Tenzin Gyatso was found. It doesn't take a Political Science major to recognize a familiar story here. Remove the red robe disguise and what you have is a bunch of elites who have come up with a foul-proof way to perpetuate their own power. It is quite ingenious really, and any little boy will do because of course even the Dalai Lama (the Enlightened one himself!) needs to be properly trained and encouraged in his early years by the wise counsel of the High Lamas. I don't know which bothers me more: the whole Dalai Lama set up as cleverly packaged and marketed sham for theocracy or that the West seems to have swallowed it in full. I am leaning towards the latter. Perhaps it would have been okay if the Dalai Lama merely claimed to be a religious leader, something akin to the Pope (though some have suggested the Pope actually controls everything). But again what people miss is who the Dalai Lama actually claims to be. On his surprisingly modern and [saavy official website](http:\/\/www.dalailama.com\/) (one has to wonder how many Tibetans have had access to it) a brief biography begins with, \"His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is both the head of state and the spiritual leader of Tibet\". The head of state *and* the spiritual leader. Wait. What about the doctrine of the separation of church and state, a clever reader might ask, weren't there very good reasons for writing that into our Constitution? While there is reason to believe that the current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is a prudent and pragmatic leader, that fact does not make the Dalai Lama as an *institution* less theocratic and less potentially subject to all the abuses that come along with theocracy. What is highly interesting and perhaps promising is that Tenzin Gyatso actually has proposed that the selection of the Dalai Lama, should the Tibetan people choose so, can become a majority decision by the Tibetan people instead of the High Lamas. An appalling notion from a Tibetan Buddhist religious perspective but one that will certainly gain allies among a more educated Western audience. Furthermore, Tenzin Gyatso maintains his stance of non-violence (a huge credit to Buddhism) and accurate belief that China won't give up Tibet. Thus he advocates instead for increased Tibetan governing autonomy and an end to religious suppression and persecution, which should be more appropriately interpreted as political persecution. Afterall, if these were just regular monks who prayed all the time, why would China care? Tenzin Gyatso's demands are reasonable and I think are ones that could be realistically achieved to the betterment of Tibetan lives. Unfortunately, the latest developments in Tibet are steering away from the Dalai Lama's moderate stance. Public statements Tibetan radicals criticizes the Tenzin Gyatso for refusing to call for a boycott of the Bejijing Olympic Games and signal increasing frustration with his stance of non-violence. One such radical suggested that many may start looking elsewhere for political leadership, \"We are demanding a peace dialogue between His Holiness and the Chinese. But at the moment, Dalai Lama is out of the picture. It's a Tibetan people's movement,\" he said. Such statements for me ring so hauntingly of the radical nationalism that cost millions of lives in the 20th century that they ought to be cause for heightened attention if not alarm. There is also ample reason to believe that the Tibetan protests fall more in the lines of the Indonesian riots against the Chinese during the 1990s, motivated more so by economic woes as opposed to ethnic ones. While the Dalai Lama himself acknowledged on March 17th, \"As far as material development concerned, we get much benefit from being a part of China\", certainly those predominately in power and control economic resources are not ethnically Tibetan. What matters is the sense of relative deprivation as opposed to absolute gains, and when there is a consciousness formed by a group of always being the losers (in this case along ethnic lines) then mass discontent and protest will occur. If you buy the economic discontent argument, then the Tibetan protests are no different than the thousands of peasant riots in China throughout the countryside which seldom get much media coverage. The Chinese government is caught between a rock and a hard place. Many forget just how ethnically diverse China is and how difficult historically it has been for any head of state to hold the country together. If it shows willingness to compromise with the Tibetans, this will fuel many more protests along ethnic lines (as it already has) that will threaten China's very geo-political existence and result inevitably in mass chaos and violence. These implications need to be considered regardless of whether you believe Tibet is part of China or not. Actually this situation is something the West ought to be sympathetic to through its experience with the former Yugoslavia and other parts of Eastern Europe (Bosnia being the prime example) where it was extremely hesitant to recognize independence movements for fear of widespread instability. Let's not forget that unequivocally equating self determination to a right to political sovereignty would severely and violently destabilize the world order. The international community should not blindly support the Tibetan protests, but qualify its support. It should continue to pressure China on the issues of human rights in general and advise restraint in responding to the protests. It should also make it clear to Tibetan radicals that inciting violence will not be rewarded. While I think the Olympics are a prime time to pressure China on issues of human rights, I am uneasy about what will happen once the window of opportunity closes. There is no such thing as easy short term solutions; unduly taking advantage of China's current position may result in worse situations for Tibetans later on when the eyes of the public flicker elsewhere.\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>lina peng<\/strong>\r\n\r\nmarch 2008\r\n\r\nAnyone who follows the news (myself included) has recently been bombarded with minute by minute updates of the situation in Tibet.

I am leaning towards the latter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would have been okay if the Dalai Lama merely claimed to be a religious leader, something akin to the Pope (though some have suggested the Pope actually controls everything). But again what people miss is who the Dalai Lama actually claims to be. On his surprisingly modern and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dalailama.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">saavy official website<\/a> (one has to wonder how many Tibetans have had access to it) a brief biography begins with, \"His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is both the head of state and the spiritual leader of Tibet\". The head of state <em>and<\/em> the spiritual leader. Wait. What about the doctrine of the separation of church and state, a clever reader might ask, weren't there very good reasons for writing that into our Constitution? While there is reason to believe that the current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is a prudent and pragmatic leader, that fact does not make the Dalai Lama as an <em>institution<\/em> less theocratic and less potentially subject to all the abuses that come along with theocracy.\r\n\r\nWhat is highly interesting and perhaps promising is that Tenzin Gyatso actually has proposed that the selection of the Dalai Lama, should the Tibetan people choose so, can become a majority decision by the Tibetan people instead of the High Lamas. An appalling notion from a Tibetan Buddhist religious perspective but one that will certainly gain allies among a more educated Western audience. Furthermore, Tenzin Gyatso maintains his stance of non-violence (a huge credit to Buddhism) and accurate belief that China won't give up Tibet. Thus he advocates instead for increased Tibetan governing autonomy and an end to religious suppression and persecution, which should be more appropriately interpreted as political persecution. Afterall, if these were just regular monks who prayed all the time, why would China care? Tenzin Gyatso's demands are reasonable and I think are ones that could be realistically achieved to the betterment of Tibetan lives.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the latest developments in Tibet are steering away from the Dalai Lama's moderate stance. Public statements Tibetan radicals criticizes the Tenzin Gyatso for refusing to call for a boycott of the Bejijing Olympic Games and signal increasing frustration with his stance of non-violence. One such radical suggested that many may start looking elsewhere for political leadership, \"We are demanding a peace dialogue between His Holiness and the Chinese. But at the moment, Dalai Lama is out of the picture. It's a Tibetan people's movement,\" he said. Such statements for me ring so hauntingly of the radical nationalism that cost millions of lives in the 20th century that they ought to be cause for heightened attention if not alarm.\r\n\r\nThere is also ample reason to believe that the Tibetan protests fall more in the lines of the Indonesian riots against the Chinese during the 1990s, motivated more so by economic woes as opposed to ethnic ones. While the Dalai Lama himself acknowledged on March 17th, \"As far as material development concerned, we get much benefit from being a part of China\", certainly those predominately in power and control economic resources are not ethnically Tibetan. What matters is the sense of relative deprivation as opposed to absolute gains, and when there is a consciousness formed by a group of always being the losers (in this case along ethnic lines) then mass discontent and protest will occur. If you buy the economic discontent argument, then the Tibetan protests are no different than the thousands of peasant riots in China throughout the countryside which seldom get much media coverage.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese government is caught between a rock and a hard place. Many forget just how ethnically diverse China is and how difficult historically it has been for any head of state to hold the country together. If it shows willingness to compromise with the Tibetans, this will fuel many more protests along ethnic lines (as it already has) that will threaten China's very geo-political existence and result inevitably in mass chaos and violence. These implications need to be considered regardless of whether you believe Tibet is part of China or not. Actually this situation is something the West ought to be sympathetic to through its experience with the former Yugoslavia and other parts of Eastern Europe (Bosnia being the prime example) where it was extremely hesitant to recognize independence movements for fear of widespread instability. Let's not forget that unequivocally equating self determination to a right to political sovereignty would severely and violently destabilize the world order.\r\n\r\nThe international community should not blindly support the Tibetan protests, but qualify its support. It should continue to pressure China on the issues of human rights in general and advise restraint in responding to the protests. It should also make it clear to Tibetan radicals that inciting violence will not be rewarded. While I think the Olympics are a prime time to pressure China on issues of human rights, I am uneasy about what will happen once the window of opportunity closes. There is no such thing as easy short term solutions; unduly taking advantage of China's current position may result in worse situations for Tibetans later on when the eyes of the public flicker elsewhere.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 16:33:17 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 10 Mar 2010 04:27:53 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 16:33:17 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":606,"title":"mayday may day???","slug":"mayday-may-day","markdown":"\nby **jason coe** may 2007 Begrudgingly, I awoke this morning to attend a \u201cmandatory\u201d 9 AM class because the instructor had written me an email specifically asking me to attend.

But I couldn\u2019t escape the mental image of the trash cans filled with crumpled flyers, the articles about the politically apathetic Asian American population at Cal, and protestors giving zealous speeches into loudspeakers that only motivated passersby to turn up the volume on their iPods. For the record, I am far from being a strong political activist. Nearly a decade ago, when I first began my undergraduate studies, I joined a protest to end [discrimination against Arab Americans after 9\/11](http:\/\/www.villagevoice.com\/news\/0328,pyne,45400,1.html). After waving signs and shouting at the top of my lungs, I felt great. I felt mobilized, active, and more than anything, proud. But as the weeks passed and the political uproar dwindled, it dawned on me that our efforts had done little to curtail the continuing violent attacks against Arab Americans and the slow appropriation of American civil rights. After that sad epiphany six years ago and reading more than my fair share of [Milan Kundera](http:\/\/www.sparknotes.com\/lit\/unbearablelightness\/quotes.html) (quote# 2), I swore to myself that I would never again march with a massive protest, shout slogans, nor pump my fist in the air (unless it was at a sporting event).

I looked at all the students hustling past us to class, as I had only an hour ago, and felt disheartened. Among us, I counted very few actual students, and after a few blocks, and quite a few angry honks from [already irritated morning commuters](http:\/\/sfgate.com\/cgi-bin\/article.cgi?file=\/c\/a\/2007\/05\/01\/MNGQUPIKI81.DTL), most of the twenty-somethings with backpacks on began to peel off. What began as a solidified march of the penguins-style protest turned into a rag-tag group of individuals trying their best to retain courage in the face of road rage. Despite my impulse to be [interpellated](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interpellation#Interpellation.2C_a_concept_coined_by_Althusser), I tried my best ignore the double yellow lines and traffic lights against the behest of our small police escort. At Alcatraz Avenue, the Berkeley Police Department left us to the traffic. Soon after, the batteries in the protest leader\u2019s microphone gave out, children began to whine asking to be carried by piggy-back, and my feet began to hurt when I saw the hazy outline of the Oakland Federal Building in the distant horizon. But as we continued marching into the less affluent areas, we garnered more and more support. While we still received the occasional middle finger, drivers began to honk in encouragement, giving us a wave and a thumbs-up. People cheered as we walked past, and every few blocks or so a new contingent of American-flag waving protestors would join the walk. Every additional member was greeted with a huge cheer. As we passed 40th Street, our entourage had grown into the hundreds. High school and middle school students, who had joined us by jumping over fences chained by campus administrators in anticipation of the walkout, cajoled us with their antics and high-spirits. Soon a large contingent of Oakland police officers walked alongside us and blocked off intersections. We were too large to ignore. Suddenly, a six mile walk on a spring day didn\u2019t seem too bad. One of the marchers I was lucky enough to meet was Ramon, a recently laid-off construction worker and father of five. He had just turned in a job application in Berkeley when he saw us impeding traffic and spontaneously joined. Upon meeting me, he noted that I was the only Asian in our brigade. After having my morning caffeine, I was fully prepared for the conversation this time, and I informed him that [out of the projected 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, over a million originate from Asia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Origin). We just happened to be walking through Oakland Koreatown, and I pointed at the stores and restaurants and estimated that a few of the onlookers were in all likelihood immigrants that had overstayed their visas and were now working for poverty wages in this ethnic enclave. I then went on to tell him about how racist and unfair immigration laws had been leveled against Asian Americans since the mid 19th century, culminating with the [Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chinese_Exclusion_Act). Using cheap labor to bolster the economy is an [American tradition](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slavery#Slavery_in_the_Americas). Ramon then asked me, \u201cThen how come more of Asians aren\u2019t marching with us?\u201d A variety of responses flashed through my head, but none seemed adequate. I tried to explain that there hadn\u2019t been much effort to reach out to this marginalized, but massive populace, and that [myths perpetuated about Asians being the model minority](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Model_minority_myth) had made it significantly harder for them to mobilize politically. I even forwarded a hypothesis that the media\u2019s portrayal of the immigrant rights movement as being just a \u201cMexican issue\u201d had convinced them that it wasn\u2019t their struggle. In the end, I just told him: \u201cWell, I\u2019m here.\u201d And he smiled. Just as our conversation ended, we rounded the corner of 14th and Broadway and met with a huge roar. We looked ahead to see thousands of protestors that had marched to the city center from the Fruitvale BART station. Cheers erupted from our ranks, as we scuttled to join the group moving towards the rallying point. As I sifted through the enormous crowd in a fruitless search for my sister who had marched with the coalition from Laney College, I was happy to see people of all ethnicities, Asian included, chanting: \u201cSi, se puede!\u201d, \u201cPueblo escucha!

A hunger to find out more\u00a0\u2013\u00a0about the snarky editors who seemed to know everything, about the magazine (tacky as it was), about this Asian American history I had no clue existed, and most of all, about myself.

Given the relative nascence of open discussion surrounding this topic, it is understandable that the information is somewhat obscure. Nonetheless, recent developments threaten to further aggravate\u00a0\u00a0the financial situation for a nearly invisible population \u2014 undocumented API AB540 students, who constitute 40 to 44 percent of all undocumented AB540 students, and are the second-largest undocumented group in the UC system. So little discussion has materialized regarding API AB540 students, a label often erroneously used interchangeably with\u00a0undocumented\u00a0API AB540 students. AB540 is a state law that grants all students, regardless of documentation status, the ability to pay in-state tuition if they graduated from a California high school and were enrolled for at least three years.\u00a0\u00a0According to the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California (APALC), undocumented beneficiaries\u00a0\u00a0must apply for legal citizenship once they attain eligibility. In spite of these benefits, undocumented students are ineligible for work-study, state grants, or other forms of federal or taxpayer-funded financial aid. The statute was disputed last year in the California Supreme Court case\u00a0Martinez v. Regents of the University of California,\u00a0which claimed that the law conflicted with a federal law that prohibits these benefits, unless they also extend to non-resident U.S. citizens. While AB540 has since remained in effect, the Court is currently considering the outcome of this case, which could significantly hamper the attainment of higher education for undocumented students. According to Marwin Yeung, Political Awareness Coordinator for REACH!, Berkeley\u2019s API recruitment and retention center, UC Berkeley holds the second largest undocumented youth population in all UC campuses. Though resident students now face tuition exceeding $10,000, it is currently unknown how much non-resident tuition will increase.\u00a0\u00a0The proposed fee hikes do not apply to out-of-state or international students. However, undocumented AB540 students already typically struggle with tuition and experience subsequent problems with academic retention. A potential repeal of the AB540 law would disastrously exacerbate the situation that these students presently face. \u201cMark Yudof and the UC Regents can cover up all they want, consoling the public that the University of California system will still strive to waver tuition fees for those with low-income backgrounds ($70,000 or less),\u201d said Mia Jamili, Advocacy Coordinator for Pilipino Academic Student Services (PASS) and one of the Lead Interns for the Multicultural Immigrant Student Program (MISP). \u201cBut the truth of the matter is that the students who never were able to receive any federal aid and any grants\/scholarships that initially require a Social Security Number on their applications will remain in the struggle and be left behind.\u201d Given this information, it is troubling that only limited discussion on this issue has transpired, and so little of it has concentrated on the experiences of API AB540 students. Aside from the relatively small amount of campus dialogue regarding this population, very few print articles cover the experiences of these students. Dialogue regarding this issue is imperative, as it not only creates a space to implement relevant services for a vastly underserved student population, but also addresses many little-discussed immigration-related issues that plague the API community. Student organizers on campus attribute the invisibility of API AB540 students to forces both internal and external to the community. Culturally, API communities tend to view immigration extremely sensitively, and do not discuss their immigration statuses even when asking for help. According to Yeung, however, the media has also significantly framed much of the immigration debate around racializing the Latino community and maintaining the popular notion of APIs as a \u201cmodel minority\u201d group. \u201cIt\u2019s not like an immigrant issue anymore [to the public], but I think [the media\u2019s] trying to make it specifically a Latino issue,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cIt reinforces the idea that Asians do not have immigration issues. Or if they do, they can just grab themselves by the bootstraps, get themselves up.\" The facts illustrate that this could not be more untrue. The dearth of services that serve the API community\u2019s immigration needs stems at least partially from the lack of API presence in the immigration debates. According to an October 2008 article by AsianWeek, undocumented Asian students do not even have much information on the college process; such services are often only available in English or Spanish, and are thus inaccessible to non-English or Spanish proficient APIs. The silenced dialogue on API undocumented students also curtails discussion about immigration issues unique or specifically pertinent to APIs. This obscures the community\u2019s particular immigration needs, such as improved legal services to resolve problems with immigration or documentation status. According to an amicus brief recently put out by APALC, API students often immigrate legally at a young age, but lose their legal status over time. Among the included testimonials are the stories of a girl who arrived in the U.S. legally as an infant, but was unsuccessful at attaining permanent residency because of her family attorney\u2019s mismanagement of their residency petition, and another family\u2019s inability to attain permanent residency because their employer cheated them out of two thousand dollars to process a visa application. Another testimonial details the story of an Indonesian boy who attempted to apply for political asylum\u00a0but was denied because he did not file his application within one year of arriving in the United States; he is able to legally work and live in the country, but cannot apply for permanent residence. Such narratives not only counter dominant perceptions of illegal immigrants, but also emphasize the need for expanded and improved legal counsel for API immigration needs. \u201cI think not many people know that AB540 students come from the API community, which makes it even more difficult to find resources,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re an AB540 student and you\u2019re API. It might be kind of difficult to approach a Latino organization that focuses on AB540 students, because there might be different experiences that their AB540 students may have.\u201d Similarly, the breakdown of the populations impacted most by AB540 defies an inimical, pervasive notion within the API community that East Asian communities, typically understood to comprise the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean American communities, are somehow better off or less affected by API issues. The largest group of affected AB540 APIs is Korean American, comprising 60 percent of API undocumented undergraduates within the UC system. Moreover, 14 percent are Chinese American, 10 percent are Filipino American, 7 percent are South Asian, 7 percent are Southeast Asian, and 1 percent are Pacific Islander. \u201cI think often East Asians are perceived as this \u2018more privileged\u2019 group. I think this is a prime example of how Asian Americans are still struggling, more specifically, East Asians,\u201d Yeung added. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to be conscious of how each community is being affected.\u201d It is thus problematic to dismiss East Asian populations as more \u201cprivileged\u201d when one of the most pressing and concealed API issues is one that largely affects their community. While AB540 students currently face an institutional barrier that seriously threatens their progression through higher education, it is at least optimistic that student organizers have opened up the discussion through focusing on the budget cuts. According to Jamili, affected students and their allies have been taking action through campus support networks, legislation, and education and the dissemination of proper information. However, the experiences of API AB540 students cannot be neglected as epiphenomenal to any greater issue. Immigration is most definitely a problem that impacts APIs, and must be central to the discussion of holistically advancing the API community and ameliorating their struggles. \u201cWe must keep in mind that fears hinder substantial voices as other voices instill fear,\u201d Jamili said. \u201cWhat we have encountered and accomplished so far is only the beginning.\u201d\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>denise wong<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe ongoing debates regarding the UC budget crisis have proven a difficult space to initiate a discussion about how budget cuts will affect underserved sectors of the API community.

Culturally, API communities tend to view immigration extremely sensitively, and do not discuss their immigration statuses even when asking for help.\r\n\r\nAccording to Yeung, however, the media has also significantly framed much of the immigration debate around racializing the Latino community and maintaining the popular notion of APIs as a \u201cmodel minority\u201d group.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like an immigrant issue anymore [to the public], but I think [the media\u2019s] trying to make it specifically a Latino issue,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cIt reinforces the idea that Asians do not have immigration issues. Or if they do, they can just grab themselves by the bootstraps, get themselves up.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts illustrate that this could not be more untrue. The dearth of services that serve the API community\u2019s immigration needs stems at least partially from the lack of API presence in the immigration debates. According to an October 2008 article by AsianWeek, undocumented Asian students do not even have much information on the college process; such services are often only available in English or Spanish, and are thus inaccessible to non-English or Spanish proficient APIs.\r\n\r\nThe silenced dialogue on API undocumented students also curtails discussion about immigration issues unique or specifically pertinent to APIs. This obscures the community\u2019s particular immigration needs, such as improved legal services to resolve problems with immigration or documentation status. According to an amicus brief recently put out by APALC, API students often immigrate legally at a young age, but lose their legal status over time. Among the included testimonials are the stories of a girl who arrived in the U.S. legally as an infant, but was unsuccessful at attaining permanent residency because of her family attorney\u2019s mismanagement of their residency petition, and another family\u2019s inability to attain permanent residency because their employer cheated them out of two thousand dollars to process a visa application. Another testimonial details the story of an Indonesian boy who attempted to apply for political asylum\u00a0but was denied because he did not file his application within one year of arriving in the United States; he is able to legally work and live in the country, but cannot apply for permanent residence.\r\n\r\nSuch narratives not only counter dominant perceptions of illegal immigrants, but also emphasize the need for expanded and improved legal counsel for API immigration needs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not many people know that AB540 students come from the API community, which makes it even more difficult to find resources,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re an AB540 student and you\u2019re API. It might be kind of difficult to approach a Latino organization that focuses on AB540 students, because there might be different experiences that their AB540 students may have.\u201d\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the breakdown of the populations impacted most by AB540 defies an inimical, pervasive notion within the API community that East Asian communities, typically understood to comprise the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean American communities, are somehow better off or less affected by API issues. The largest group of affected AB540 APIs is Korean American, comprising 60 percent of API undocumented undergraduates within the UC system. Moreover, 14 percent are Chinese American, 10 percent are Filipino American, 7 percent are South Asian, 7 percent are Southeast Asian, and 1 percent are Pacific Islander.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think often East Asians are perceived as this \u2018more privileged\u2019 group. I think this is a prime example of how Asian Americans are still struggling, more specifically, East Asians,\u201d Yeung added. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to be conscious of how each community is being affected.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is thus problematic to dismiss East Asian populations as more \u201cprivileged\u201d when one of the most pressing and concealed API issues is one that largely affects their community.\r\n\r\nWhile AB540 students currently face an institutional barrier that seriously threatens their progression through higher education, it is at least optimistic that student organizers have opened up the discussion through focusing on the budget cuts. According to Jamili, affected students and their allies have been taking action through campus support networks, legislation, and education and the dissemination of proper information. However, the experiences of API AB540 students cannot be neglected as epiphenomenal to any greater issue. Immigration is most definitely a problem that impacts APIs, and must be central to the discussion of holistically advancing the API community and ameliorating their struggles.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must keep in mind that fears hinder substantial voices as other voices instill fear,\u201d Jamili said. \u201cWhat we have encountered and accomplished so far is only the beginning.\u201d","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":16,"created_at":"Sat, 27 Feb 2010 03:30:14 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 27 Feb 2010 03:37:58 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 27 Feb 2010 03:30:14 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":637,"title":"Are you Sleeping?","slug":"are-you-sleeping","markdown":"\n*The Reality of Sleep Deprivation* by **la salle duong, kevin macdonald,\u00a0tawny tsang** We\u2019ve all seen it in lecture: the nodding head; the gaping mouth. As the semester progresses, these actions become less associated with sentiments of awe or concordance and more with sleepiness. This really is quite a shame considering our growing student fees. One of the biggest reasons for gaining a higher education degree is to improve our chances of future success. However, the secret to success is not as lucrative as it seems and can take its shape in a much simpler and immediate form \u2013 sleep. Ben Franklin once said, \u201cEarly to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\u201d While we are all familiar with this proverb, few of us actually take it seriously. Sleep deprivation is an issue that seriously affects the health, memory performance, and mood of our age group. According to the National Institute of health, over 40 percent of Americans are sleep deprived with college students being most sleep deprived among that population. This sleep deprivation is self-induced whether it be due to the pressure from parents, the stress of being in a highly competitive environment, or the difficulties of balancing grades and a social life. It seems only a bit too obvious \u2013 of course sleep matters. Empirical studies have demonstrated that sleep may be a key regulator of mood, metabolism, immunity function, and memory. But why don\u2019t we do it? As college students, our grades and achievements often seem to fluctuate with the different types of moods and situations we find ourselves in. Sometime it is family stress, other times it is arguments with friends, or many times it\u2019s the stress from your workload keeping you out of bed at night. Many are unaware however, just how closely your mood, emotional, performance and ability to read others\u2019 emotion are modified when you are under sleep deprivation conditions. According to UC Berkeley professor Dr. Matthew Walker and colleagues, the prefrontal lobe of your brain is actively inhibited in communicating with your fear center, or amygdala, when sleep deprived. In turn, you are unable to regulate emotionally driven situations the following day, lacking the feedback loop that has been temporarily severed to your prefrontal cortex. You become all emotion and no logic, acting in ways unlike you and possibly damaging to the situation! On that note, studies have shown that there are high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide among Asian American and Pacific Islander youth. Some suggest that the tension between adhering to traditional family values and mainstream culture may cause additional stress and anxiety. On top of that, being at a competitive university certainly adds to the stress load. While there are many ways to cope with stress, one of the easiest seems to be eating. Although many of us seem to be blessed with fast metabolism, getting enough sleep may actually help ward off unwanted winter pounds. Studies have shown that people who typically sleep 5 hours or less are significantly heavier than those who sleep 7 to 8 hours. People who sleep 4 to 5 hours a night are 50 to 73 percent more likely to be obese than those who sleep 7 to 9 hours. Even people who slept 6 hours a night (a common practice among college students) are 23 percent more likely to be obese. Inadequate amounts of sleep can also lead to an imbalance of hormones which regulate our appetite and our ability to process glucose. In a study with healthy young males, those who were sleep deprived (receiving only 4 hours of sleep for 2 nights) saw a drop in leptin levels (the hormone which tells us we\u2019re full), and a rise in ghrelin levels (the \u201ceat hormone\u201d). Furthermore, they reported a 24 percent increase in hunger, and it wasn\u2019t salad that they were craving. The subjects saw a 32 percent increase in the intake of carbohydrate rich foods like donuts and pizza. Not only does an increase in ghrelin mean a bigger appetite, it means a decrease in our energy expenditure, which means more weight. Finally, if weight is not an issue, then your health certainly is. Normally, this is how our metabolism works: after we eat, the pancreas releases insulin, which signals our muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose. This process ensures that our blood glucose remains at a normal level. However, when an individual has insulin-resistant metabolism, higher levels of insulin are needed to accomplish adequate glucose absorption. This can lead not only to dangerous drops in blood sugar, but also progression toward type-2 diabetes. Are you wondering what all of this has to do with sleep? In a study in which healthy young individuals were sleep deprived (4hrs sleep\/night for 5 nights), measurements indicated an alarming 40 percent decrease in glucose tolerance, rates similar to those who are pre-diabetic. According to the National Diabetes Statistics, Asian Americans are one of the most at-risk ethnic groups to develop type-2, or insulin-resistant, diabetes with an incidence rate of 8 percent for individuals over 20. In addition, for individuals under 20, the incidence rate for developing type-2 diabetes among Asian Americans is over twice that of non-Hispanic Whites (20 per 100,000\/year versus 9 per 100,000\/year). Studies suggest that genetic influences are a contributor to these statistics for Asian Americans. Despite our youth, we can\u2019t fight genetic predispositions. Sleep has more to do with health than just regulating metabolism. With the H1N1 craze, a lot of people have become hypersensitive to sanitation and illness prevention. However, the easiest, and surest, way to prevent getting sick is sleeping. We\u2019ve often had that groggy feeling of being lethargic and stuffy after pulling an all nighter. This congested feeling is similar to the head cold or other common illnesses. Sleep has very important immune functions. Studies have shown that in just one night of 5 hour sleep, our Natural Killer Cell activity drops by 73 percent. That\u2019s something that hand sanitizer or EmergenC can\u2019t account for. In addition, chronically sleeping less than 7 hours a night reduces our body\u2019s ability to build up immune responses. So even if we get the flu shot and become immunized from H1N1, our body won\u2019t be able to build up as strong a defense. which may render the shot useless. Being a high-risk group for several health issues including depression and diabetes, Asian Americans may be more susceptible to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation. In addition, about 21 percent of Asian Americans lack health insurance compared to the 16 percent of all Americans, which makes it even more imporant to stay healthy especially during flu season. The cost of not sleeping not only affects our minds and bodies, but also our wallets. Imagine how much you could save by not buying energy drinks, coffee, or snacks to keep you from falling asleep at the desk! Like many things, getting more sleep is much easier said than done. However, with winter break rolling around the corner, there is a great opportunity to catch up with some sleep. It\u2019ll also be a way to treat yourself to some of the respect your body deserves. With midterms and papers, sleep is often put to the bottom of our priority list. Hopefully from this article, you will have learned that sleep is not dispensable or something that should be taken for granted. Why not try making sleep part of your New Year\u2019s Resolution? There\u2019s nothing to lose \u2013 only benefits to gain. With that, sweet dreams. Tips to falling asleep: 1. Don\u2019t read, watch TV, or work in bed. Associating waking activities with your sleeping space can confuse your body and make it more difficult to use that space for sleeping. 2. Set the stage for sleep. Make your sleeping space as quiet, dark, and pleasant as possible. Clean sheets, room-darkening drapes, and a pair of earplugs will all help to make the room as sleep-conducive as possible. 3. Wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day. Your body will become conditioned to follow this schedule, meaning that you will become tired and be able to fall asleep at a predictable time every night. 4. Keep the TV and computer off for 30 to 60 minutes before bed. The light from the screens can trick your body into thinking that it\u2019s still daylight and not time for sleeping. Read, write in a notebook, or listen to soothing music at a quiet volume just before bed.

This may have been true one year ago, but in today\u2019s economic crisis, even MBAs from prestigious universities are worrying about finding a job. With last year\u2019s collapse of the Lehman Brothers, thousands of financial jobs went down the drain. According to VoaNews.com, by 2010, in New York City 46,000 financial jobs and hundreds of others that depend on Wall Street could be gone. Because of the uncertain future in the financial job market, many Asian Americans and U.S.-educated Asians are now considering searching for jobs overseas. So where are they headed now? Back to Asia. To the U.S. economy, this is pretty bad news. But to Asia, it is a potential benefit. In recent MBA career fairs for students across the nation, recruiters from companies in Asia have actually been looking for Asian and Asian American graduates and MBAs educated in U.S. universities to join their firms; it\u2019s clear that companies in Asia are interested in recruiting talent from this subset of the population. Meanwhile, as the competition for jobs in the finance market becomes ever more intense, it is an appealing option to Asian Americans with U.S. degrees to work overseas because they can add that extra impressive line to their resumes and cover letters. You may ask, \u201cWhy the outflux of educated Asian Americans to Asia?\u201d A recent study by Duke University revealed that Asians educated in the U.S. believe there is a rising demand for their skills back in their home countries. At the same time, there is also a trend of Asian countries wanting Asian Americans as well as their own citizens \u2013 after obtaining a U.S. education \u2013 to work in Asia. Therefore, both sides share a mutual desire that Asian Americans and U.S.-educated Asians look to Asia for more job opportunities. Because of this, China, India, and other Asian countries are seeing a huge increase in highly educated MBA returnees. In 2008 alone, China saw an increase of 55 percent in the number of returnees. As a result, many professional firms are speculating that Asian Americans and U.S.-educated Asians have solid paths in the financial world despite the ongoing economic crisis. However, there is another angle from which we can analyze these facts. With the outflow of talented Asian MBAs from the U.S. today, are we witnessing a modern version of the sojourner mentality of our Asian American predecessors? \u201cSojourner mentality\u201d within the context of Asian American history refers to immigrants\u2019 belief that their emigration abroad was only temporary \u2013 that they would return to their respective homelands in Asia one day. This mentality was, to a certain extent, a psychological motivation for the immigrants to endure their struggles in the United States, as they hoped to return home one day to reunite with their families. Now it appears as if the sojourner mentality is returning right in front of our eyes, though not quite in exactly the same form. While the trend of Asian MBAs emigrating to Asia does seem to encompass a sort of \u201csojourner mentality,\u201d there is a difference in the manifestation of that mentality between U.S.-educated Asians from Asia and Asian Americans. Asian international students educated in the United States are likely to bear a \u201csojourner mentality\u201d more similar to that of the original immigrants because many explicitly choose to go to school here for a U.S. degree and then leave to find careers back in Asia. However, since many Asian American MBAs were born in America, they are not really \u201csojourners\u201d yearning to go back \u201chome,\u201d especially those who grew up in the States and went to school here (that is, excluding those who immigrated here at a later age or chose to study abroad). Yet in a broader sense, these Asian Americans can still be thought of as \u201csojourners\u201d \u2013 on a level that may span several generations in time. Ironically, it seems that history has gone a full circle, beginning with the first Asian immigrants who settled in the U.S. in hopes of climbing up the economic ladder and now ending with highly educated Asian American MBAs moving back to Asia for the same reason which brought their predecessors here. But despite this difference from international Asian students, the key point is that Asian Americans who grew up in the U.S are also choosing to go back to Asia. With the concept of sojourner mentality in mind, we can further understand the reasons behind this fact. The \u201csojourner mentality\u201d reinforces a common theme between the past and present \u2013 the strength of Asian Americans\u2019 sense of their respective communities and the connection they often feel with their ethnic background. In the past, this mentality helped form strong networks of ethnic enclaves among America\u2019s Asian immigrants. In present times, it is one factor motivating Asian American MBAs to move to Asia. Thus, perhaps this is another reason Asian Americans feel that Asia is a viable option in their job search; after all, we are all connected with Asian blood. And as we see, recruiters from Asia realize this mentality and are thus targeting Asian American MBAs for recruitment. In any case, some factors definitely make the distinction between Asian American MBAs\/U.S.- educated Asian MBAs and non-Asian MBAs within the job market in Asia. 1.\u00a0\u00a0Mother tongue Yes, it is true that English has become the international language of our times, but knowing the native language of that certain Asian country can only help the MBA job candidate. More importantly, not only do they beat the locals by having a degree from an American institution, Asian Americans can also communicate fluently in\u00a0*both *English and Asian languages. This is very appealing to employers in general, especially considering the extent to which financial industries are becoming globalized today. 2. Cultural Understanding Imagine venturing into a foreign land, surrounded by high skyscrapers and people gabbling in an alien language around you. What do you do to fit it, or at the very least, not offend anyone? An advantage Asian Americans have is that they have already been exposed to the culture and are thus more ready to adapt and adjust to the environment in Asia. They are familiar with cultural nuances, from how to greet someone to knowing what can or cannot be talked about. At the very least, Asian Americans already have enough cultural insight to not make a fool out of themselves \u2013 for example, not to place one\u2019s chopsticks vertically into a bowl of rice, because this resembles incense sticks used at Asian temples to respect the deceased ones (ultimate table manner failure!). It is not that non-Asians won\u2019t succeed in the Asian market, but it is definitely easier for Asian Americans because oftentimes they have already been exposed to the cultural lifestyles and aspects of their own respective Asian countries, thus, giving them that edge in today\u2019s job market. Thus, it\u2019s no surprise that so many are returning to their root countries to search for jobs. As more and more Asian American MBAs realize their potential career paths in Asia, this could be a sign that Asian Americans are now recognizing the advantage of understanding of their heritage with regard to the world of finance. East and South Asia, areas experiencing some of the fastest economic growth in the world, offer very attractive financial and cultural options for recent Asian American graduates looking to expand their job searches. Last but definitely not least, the fact that many Asian Americans are returning to Asia shows that they are choosing to get a little closer back in touch with their roots. Perhaps along their job search they will learn something new about their ancestors, experience new emotional attachments with their cultures, and discover new aspects of their Asian identities that will offer them a better understanding of themselves and their cultural heritages.\n","html":"<em>Asian American MBAs going back to their roots for job opportunities<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>michell ho<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMy dad has always said that an MBA is the ticket to a job in the finance industry. This may have been true one year ago, but in today\u2019s economic crisis, even MBAs from prestigious universities are worrying about finding a job. With last year\u2019s collapse of the Lehman Brothers, thousands of financial jobs went down the drain. According to VoaNews.com, by 2010, in New York City 46,000 financial jobs and hundreds of others that depend on Wall Street could be gone.\r\n\r\nBecause of the uncertain future in the financial job market, many Asian Americans and U.S.-educated Asians are now considering searching for jobs overseas. So where are they headed now? Back to Asia.\r\n\r\nTo the U.S. economy, this is pretty bad news. But to Asia, it is a potential benefit. In recent MBA career fairs for students across the nation, recruiters from companies in Asia have actually been looking for Asian and Asian American graduates and MBAs educated in U.S. universities to join their firms; it\u2019s clear that companies in Asia are interested in recruiting talent from this subset of the population. Meanwhile, as the competition for jobs in the finance market becomes ever more intense, it is an appealing option to Asian Americans with U.S. degrees to work overseas because they can add that extra impressive line to their resumes and cover letters.\r\n\r\nYou may ask, \u201cWhy the outflux of educated Asian Americans to Asia?\u201d A recent study by Duke University revealed that Asians educated in the U.S. believe there is a rising demand for their skills back in their home countries. At the same time, there is also a trend of Asian countries wanting Asian Americans as well as their own citizens \u2013 after obtaining a U.S. education \u2013 to work in Asia. Therefore, both sides share a mutual desire that Asian Americans and U.S.-educated Asians look to Asia for more job opportunities.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, China, India, and other Asian countries are seeing a huge increase in highly educated MBA returnees. In 2008 alone, China saw an increase of 55 percent in the number of returnees. As a result, many professional firms are speculating that Asian Americans and U.S.-educated Asians have solid paths in the financial world despite the ongoing economic crisis.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is another angle from which we can analyze these facts. With the outflow of talented Asian MBAs from the U.S. today, are we witnessing a modern version of the sojourner mentality of our Asian American predecessors?\r\n\r\n\u201cSojourner mentality\u201d within the context of Asian American history refers to immigrants\u2019 belief that their emigration abroad was only temporary \u2013 that they would return to their respective homelands in Asia one day. This mentality was, to a certain extent, a psychological motivation for the immigrants to endure their struggles in the United States, as they hoped to return home one day to reunite with their families.\r\n\r\nNow it appears as if the sojourner mentality is returning right in front of our eyes, though not quite in exactly the same form.\r\n\r\nWhile the trend of Asian MBAs emigrating to Asia does seem to encompass a sort of \u201csojourner mentality,\u201d there is a difference in the manifestation of that mentality between U.S.-educated Asians from Asia and Asian Americans.\r\n\r\nAsian international students educated in the United States are likely to bear a \u201csojourner mentality\u201d more similar to that of the original immigrants because many explicitly choose to go to school here for a U.S. degree and then leave to find careers back in Asia. However, since many Asian American MBAs were born in America, they are not really \u201csojourners\u201d yearning to go back \u201chome,\u201d especially those who grew up in the States and went to school here (that is, excluding those who immigrated here at a later age or chose to study abroad).\r\n\r\nYet in a broader sense, these Asian Americans can still be thought of as \u201csojourners\u201d \u2013 on a level that may span several generations in time.

Theatre Rice, a performing arts group dedicated to fighting against the misrepresentation of Asian Americans in the media, donates about half of their funds from each show to charity.

Translation: we now experience four times more natural disasters than we did twenty years ago, largely owing to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 global warming. As big corporations, big countries, and big egos mess with the very air we breathe, changing weather patterns have led to more frequent and more unpredictable disasters that affect those least responsible for causing them. Outrageous, I know.\r\n\r\nI threw those numbers at you as my do-gooder deed of the day, hoping to inspire you to jump out of your seat and exclaim, \u201cOmg! How can I help?\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked.\r\n\r\nFollowing the examples of national relief agencies such as Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity, local organizations dedicated to fighting for Asian American issues have brought together community and compassion to raise awareness and funds. The Bay Area chapter of National Asian Pacific American Women\u2019s Forum (NAPAWF) recently held a fundraiser in Oakland, spearheaded by Linda Yang, Julia Rhee, and Jenny Ton. When I asked Yang what motivated her to organize this, she responded, \u201cThe question is more \u2018Why NOT do it?\u2019 rather than \u2018Why do it?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWith such a take-charge attitude, it comes as no surprise that NAPAWF raised over $3,200 to contribute to Typhoon Ondoy relief efforts. In describing the fundraiser itself, Yang said, \u201cWe specifically found beneficiaries who\u2026 were under the mainstream radar, who were likely not receiving equitable aid. It didn't matter your profession or destination in life, for a few hours we all held the collective goal of supporting our brothers and sisters in Samoa and the Pacific Islands.\u201d\r\n\r\nCampus organizations have also been involved in doing their part to aid the survivors of recent disasters, adding that unique Berkeley activism. Theatre Rice, a performing arts group dedicated to fighting against the misrepresentation of Asian Americans in the media, donates about half of their funds from each show to charity. For their fall mid-semester 2009 showcase, Theatre Rice chose a charity in San Francisco that supported relief for Typhoon Ondoy.\r\n\r\nAssistant producer Kathleen Mendoza emphasized that Theatre Rice \u201chas two sides: the artistic and the social\/cultural.\u201d She added that although the relief effort Typhoon Ondoy may seem like a departure from their mission statement, \u201cit really is not\u2026 We are showing solidarity among the Asian community and aiding in preserving a culture that is threatened by natural disaster.\u201d Their next show\u2019s proceeds will \u201cfollow in similar steps: the relief for those in Samoa and Tonga.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut there are communities in the U.S. with family in the areas hit hardest by these disasters, in countries they also call home. The Samoan community in Southern California was devastated when they heard of the earthquake and tsunami that caught American Samoa unawares. Although they have been trying to reach their family, phone lines have been disconnected due to heavy flooding. What are they doing, when they can\u2019t know if their loved ones are ok? This community organized around this particular issue by starting up food and clothes drives at local churches as soon as they heard what had happened in Samoa.\r\n\r\nThere. That was my do-good, feel-good moment, to educate you about catastrophes that may seem very far removed from home, but are actually close to our hearts. Now, what will your good deed of the day be? In a consumer society where we complain about tuition but go shopping every other weekend, it does not seem so hard to give up a little of our spending money. I wrote this to not only educate readers and bring some awareness to this issue but also in the hopes that this article really will inspire you to mobilize around these disasters that have stripped its victims of everything they own.\r\n\r\nSmall steps you can take to raise funds include penny wars (remember freshmen year in the dorms?), start a \u201cpeople who donate are sexy\u201d collection jar, or repost this article in popular social networks. Really, I know you spend an inordinate amount of time on Facebook or Twitter every day. Feeling creative? Write your own blog about this! The best way to learn is to teach, so by educating others, we\u2019ll spread our networks a little wider, and gather a little more change to aid those floating on rafts in the debris of their homes.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Typhoon Ondoy Strikes Philippines.\" Plan UK: Typhoon Ondoy strikes Phililppines. 2009.

Fee hikes, budget cuts, and controversial changes to the 2012\u00a0admissions policies continue to be persistent issues. This semester has\u00a0gotten even crazier across the UC campuses because we can now\u00a0officially\u00a0throw hate crimes and racist themed parties into the hodgepodge of \u201cThings\u00a0that are Screwed Up.\u201d But where is our anger? Where is our passion for\u00a0change? Our campus is becoming more and more divided at a time when\u00a0we should be building bridges to fght against something that is hurting\u00a0every single one of us in some way. If it\u2019s not the fnancial strain, it\u2019s the\u00a0downgrading of our education or the fear that we are not safe from being\u00a0targeted for our race, religion, or sexual orientation. But then we look around\u00a0and we see dance parties turn into riots flled with faming trash cans and\u00a0mobs breaking windows. We want none of it. We want our degrees fast and\u00a0we want out \u2013 the sooner the better. So we study, do our weekend thang,\u00a0and keep on keeping. I understand that we are tired and we are discouraged, but in times\u00a0like this we must remember that complacency sucks. Complacency is what\u00a0keeps the state, the administration, and the racist bigots thinking that it is\u00a0alright to keep on tearing at the wounds of our social system. We need to\u00a0think critically about the kind of world we are shaping. We must understand\u00a0that by doing nothing, we are still shaping our future \u2013 but not for the\u00a0better. Marching from Berkeley to Oakland during the March Fourth strike was\u00a0an experience that really shook that cloud of pessimism and resignation that\u00a0had hung heavy over my head since the start of the semester. Somehow, with\u00a0every mile, I felt more energized. I felt energized by the sense of solidarity\u00a0and community as I marched alongside students, parents, workers, and\u00a0teachers. Every step forward was a pledge for progress; for us, for each\u00a0other, and for the future. It\u2019s time to take that energy and channel it into long\u00a0term actions and strategies. This is our school, our society, and our world\u00a0\u2013 let\u2019s reclaim it. Here\u2019s to getting loud and getting angry together, **cecilia tran**, story editor editor's note by **montague hung** Angry. bold. Intellectual. Rooted in Community. These are the values of **hardboiled **that, even at the end of my college years, I still hold dear to\u00a0my heart. **hardboiled **frst caught my eye through a small impassioned fier asking me if I wanted to learn about Asian American issues and join a\u00a0publication. Why, yes I did! I loved writing, and was especially interested in learning about Asian American political issues, such as racism in housing and elections. But oh, how I learned so much more... I never really realized how intricate Asian American issues were until I joined hb. See, the political issues that I was initially curious about were\u00a0the ones marginally mentioned in the mainstream media. But what hb did was open my eyes to entirely new issues, things that were not mentioned in\u00a0mainstream media at all. Like how our East Asian library received minimal support from the school and was only made possible through private\u00a0donations. Or how the UC admissions policy was being revamped to curb the admissions offered to Asian Americans. These kind of issues aren\u2019t\u00a0really mentioned in the mainstream news. You have to really dig deep and scour for more information, because the truth isn\u2019t always apparent. It\u00a0almost sounds like a mystery novel, but that\u2019s the reality. These problems just aren\u2019t reported on, and in the spirit of hb, it spurred me to act. As an\u00a0Asian American myself, I have a connection to the community, and I felt appalled at how Asian American voices in art, media, and education were\u00a0so absent; and it\u2019s not even as an Asian American, but as a person that I am indignant about the undercoverage of these issues. So I made an effort to do something about it and really invested in hb, searching for new angles and alternative explanations for the way things\u00a0are. I\u2019ve learned a lot, and I\u2019ve been inspired to keep trying to learn even more. Especially today, in times of budget cuts and economic hardships,\u00a0so many issues are swept under the rug unnoticed. I hope you, the reader, will feel empowered by our publication to start (or continue) to think critically\u00a0about the issues affecting our community.

New York Fashion Week may have kicked off this year on February 11th, but all eyes were on the designers from the start as they brainstormed their initial concepts for their fall releases. Take, for example, 28 year-old Daniel Vosovic, the winner of Project Runway Season Two. Prior to this year's Fashion Week, Vosovic had the honor of being recognized by New York fashion magazine *The Cut* as one of the designers to watch for this fall; which is a point well made considering the consistently meticulous approach he uses in executing his pieces. In his 2010 Autumn\/Winter collection, he expressed the idea of beauty within decay, creating prints from oxidized iron and marble while drawing inspiration from Greek and Roman statues. However, as his collection graced the runway, it was not just the organic contrast of soft and hard vibes that stood out, but the fact that Vosovic used all Asian models. Although he pictured the idea of using Asian models from the very beginning, Vosovic definitely hit some challenges along the way. He explains that he was \u201cappalled by the lack of options [\u2026] Some [modeling] agencies just had no Asian girls.\u201d Given that this year\u2019s Fashion Week is his first show, Vosovic explained that hitting the lack-of-diversity speed bump \u201cwas a huge awakening. You hear about it all the time, and then you're in the position to request [Asian models], and I'm like, \u2018This is insane.\u2019\u201d[1] This young designer experienced what each one of us, at some point, might have pondered. We see slideshows of designers\u2019 collections, and we can\u2019t help but notice the lack of Asian representation. Given the difficulty \u201cminority\u201d models face in entering the industry, why aren\u2019t designers, who are relatively anchored in the field, more aggressive in pushing for the (literal) change of face that we need to see? Why aren\u2019t more Asian designers taking this chance to break ground and catalyze the transformation of what is considered \u201cbeautiful\u201d? First, let\u2019s look at Anna Sui. She explains in her biography, \u201cGrowing up and learning about Chinese culture from my parents, and hearing them talk about all the places they have lived\u2026prepared me for thinking globally.\u201d But does her runway show this fall really exemplify that? This season, she was all about prints inspired by the American Arts and Crafts Movement. A model with any ethnicity could have bounced off that fun, feminine look, but out of 50 models, only two were Asian. Next, let\u2019s turn to Thakoon Panichgul, a Thai American designer who put together a collection that embraced the warmth of nature and its earthy qualities. However, out of 35 models that graced the runway, not one was Asian. As the fashion favorite among many of today's top caliber celebrities, including Michelle Obama, Panichgul could have used this opportunity to make a strong statement for diversity on the runway. Why not give a nod to some Asian models the same way critics positively acknowledge how his Asian heritage influences his designs? The problem isn\u2019t only that these designers are excluding Asian models; more importantly, they have failed to embody diversity. This is not to say that every Asian designer should employ only Asian models in their lines; if that were to happen, the negative press that would surround the apparent \u201clack of diversity\u201d would just counteract the aim of diversification. Asian designers should not feel obligated to ensure that at least half their line consists of Asian models, but as some of the few \u201cminority\u201d members of the industry, it is part of their responsibility to incorporate diversity and push for a change in the social norm. In fact, all designers, regardless of ethnicity, have a strong desire to put forth new concepts and break down the walls of tradition. With that said, every designer should incorporate diversity into his or her shows. Some may argue that it is the designers\u2019 inherent right to, well, design their own shows as they see fit, and to decide that a certain skin color or body type fits their fashion styles the best. Herein lies another problem. If designers are really defining their fashion styles based on ethnicity, they are fueling the discrimination of models. Having only brunettes or blue-eyed models strut down the runway reinforces the idea that only a certain type of person can pull off the desired look. In the end, if one of fashion\u2019s definitions is *personal *expression for whoever is sporting the outfit, it will be the model who wears the clothes and not the clothes who wear the model. In a sea of Caucasian faces, a few Asians would seem to count for a lot: out of the 3,697 models who worked the catwalk, 241 were Asian. Translating that to percentages means that a little more than five percent of the models were Asian. I am not vouching for Fashion Week scorecards to include some sort of breakdown of how many models need to be of Asian descent to achieve an A-grade show. But the lack of Asian faces in the world of fashion implies that beauty in this industry does come with a scorecard where ethnicity is on the rubric. Yes, we can acknowledge that the diversity of this year\u2019s Fashion Week has definitely increased from past years, but we are still far from a fair representation. From an Asian model\u2019s perspective, taking a bite out of the Big Apple seems a far-fetched dream, considering that calling the social barriers of fashionable New York a concrete jungle would almost be an understatement. Asian designers are making impressive strides in the fashion world, and it makes me wonder why they don\u2019t take this chance to break some ground in terms of showcasing Asian models and pushing for a change in the way fashion is presented in the world today. Of course, non-Asian designers can also participate in bringing about this change. Designers of all ethnicities need to sport more than just a sense of fashion; they need to display a fierce willingness to challenge the norms of beauty, and to initiate the increase in diversity on the runway that we need to see. Daniel Vosovic, a relative newcomer to the industry, pulled off a line that consisted of all Asian models and received publicity for countering the social norm for fashion model choice. The fact is that designers have a strong say in which models are cast. If designers are persistent in insuring that the colors of the ethnic rainbow are all accounted for, then someday we will be able to stop tallying which designers incorporated what percentage of \u201cminority\u201d models, and start seeing beauty on a spectrum that doesn\u2019t account for skin hues.

As expected, an advertisement appeared before the clip started. What caught my attention, however, was that the commercial did not advertise an allergy medicine or the latest flat screen television. Instead, it showed a U.S. Olympic athlete advocating the importance of filling out the 2010 Census. In fact, the Census Bureau spent $5.1 million dollars to advertise during the Olympic Games and $2.5 million dollars during the Super Bowl. So what\u2019s the big deal about the Census? The Census Bureau claims that the Census is the \u201cSnapshot of America\u201d that provides critical data about the American population. One straightforward function of the Census is to determine the number of seats each state occupies in the House of Representatives, which is capped at 435 seats total. More importantly, close to $400 billion dollars of federal funding is distributed each year, and the data provided by the Census plays a major role in determining distribution of those funds. The 2010 Census asks ten questions, such as name, number of members in household, age, sex, date of birth, house ownership or rent, and so on. The question of interest here is number nine: \u201cWhat is Person 1\u2019s race?\u201d This seemingly innocuous question is a huge determinant of how much government aid an ethnic community receives and which ethnic issues the government prioritizes. It is for this reason that API participation in the Census is crucial. Throughout the years, this \u201cSnapshot of America\u201d has been an incomplete picture as many members of the API community were undercounted. As a result, communities lost out on a significant amount of funding and services they could have received from the government. The API community has faced many obstacles in getting complete census representation. Obviously, there is the language barrier within the API immigrant population. Some people mistakenly believe that the Census is only for American citizens. Many suspect that the data collected will be shared with other government agencies such as the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As a result, it is always a challenge to count illegal immigrants and the homeless in the United States. It is understandable for many to fear that their residency may be jeopardized or that they may face deportation after completing the Census. After all, the Census asks for name and phone number, and that seems to be enough information to track down anyone. In fact, in 1943, the Census Bureau compiled the names and locations Japanese Americans, helping the government to track them down faster to be sent to the internment camps. This act was legalized under the War Powers Act as a \u201cnecessity\u201d for national security. Although the confidentiality of the Census data was restored after World War II, and the 2000 Census director, Kenneth Prewitt, made a formal apology on behalf of the Census Bureau during the time period, the Bureau lost public trust. In addition, some people with high income do not see the urgency in filling out the form, since they feel that they do not need the social services or benefits. An even bigger problem is that some people simply do not know what the Census is altogether. Political and community leaders now recognize these obstacles, and in 2010 are spearheading community efforts to overcome them so that API\u2019s will be more visible politically and economically in America through the Census. On the federal level, the Census Bureau claims to be doing everything it can to have America counted. To start, it is sending 140,000 people through \u201cevery street, up every mountain and through every barrio and ghetto in the country,\u201d according to 2010 Census director Arnold A. Jackson in the *San Francisco Chronicle*.[1] Grassroots organizations such as Chinese Affirmative Action (CAA) play a major role in promoting the 2010 Census to the API community. One initiative CAA took was to lobby for a budget increase in ethnic media. This resulted in around forty percent of the Bureau\u2019s media budget being dedicated to Census promotion through ethnic media including television, radio programs and newspapers. Ethnic media plays a crucial role in informing the API community because for many groups, it is a more trusted source than any other media. The message sounds more convincing when it comes from informed members of your own community than when it is delivered by strangers that work for the government. Moreover, a large majority of the ethnic population who do not speak or read English fluently already rely on ethnic media to get information. In addition, CAA has made progress in eliminating the language barrier that often discourages the API community from filling out the Census. They won a policy change that requires the Census Bureau to \u201cprovide in-language outreach in hard-to-count communities.\u201d[2] In the past, the letters notifying the upcoming Census were sent to addresses only in English. However, with this policy change, the letters will be sent in five different languages \u2013 English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Russian. Nonetheless, more progress is needed to address the lack of outreach to underrepresented API ethnic groups, especially within the South and Southeast Asian category, whose needs for funding have been consistently unaddressed due to their undercounting on the Census. Promotion of the 2010 Census is happening on the Berkeley campus as well. The annual Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN), which will take place on April 11th this year, will reach out to its audience about the importance of participating in the Census. The show will have close to 2000 attendees, whom they can advertise to directly. Alvin David, Community Head of PCN, said, \u201cWhile working on the show through the next two months, we hope to educate and create advocates out of the cast so that we can at least feel comfortable to share the info with our families.\u201d He has chosen to specifically promote the Census because he realizes that \u201cour decision at this time is potentially affecting funding that our kids will get when they are in school.\u201d Students can post and answer questions about the Census through a blog at [ucbpaapcn.wordpress.com\/census\/](ucbpaapcn.wordpress.com\/census\/). This information will be incorporated into \u201cthe show as well as a series of YouTube videos.\u201d Although most recognize that the Census will generate useful data, many are still concerned over the Census\u2019 ability to accurately collect and represent racial data. From Ethnic Studies 11AC, I learned that \u201cHindu\u201d was once one of the choices given for racial category. However, \u201cHindu\u201d refers to an adherent of Hinduism, a religion not a racial category. This absurd error makes me wonder how informed the Census Bureau is when designing the question choices. One current controversy surrounds the unavailability of a multiracial category. Many mixed race individuals do not know exactly how to answer question nine. They may feel constrained to pick one or two categories that they do not feel represent them in the most accurate way. Despite past mistakes, the Census is undeniably a useful tool to recognize and address serious issues that plague our communities. The fact that it is conducted only once every ten years makes it an even more significant project. The data collected this year will influence future policymaking and fund distribution in the future. Although there is still room for improvement in this year\u2019s Census, the one action we can take now is to spread the word on the importance of the Census, and hope that this time the \u201cSnapshot of America\u201d will start to look like a truly complete picture of our country.

The annual Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN), which will take place on April 11th this year, will reach out to its audience about the importance of participating in the Census. The show will have close to 2000 attendees, whom they can advertise to directly. Alvin David, Community Head of PCN, said, \u201cWhile working on the show through the next two months, we hope to educate and create advocates out of the cast so that we can at least feel comfortable to share the info with our families.\u201d He has chosen to specifically promote the Census because he realizes that \u201cour decision at this time is potentially affecting funding that our kids will get when they are in school.\u201d Students can post and answer questions about the Census through a blog at <a href=\"ucbpaapcn.wordpress.com\/census\/\" target=\"_blank\">ucbpaapcn.wordpress.com\/census\/<\/a>. This information will be incorporated into \u201cthe show as well as a series of YouTube videos.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough most recognize that the Census will generate useful data, many are still concerned over the Census\u2019 ability to accurately collect and represent racial data. From Ethnic Studies 11AC, I learned that \u201cHindu\u201d was once one of the choices given for racial category. However, \u201cHindu\u201d refers to an adherent of Hinduism, a religion not a racial category. This absurd error makes me wonder how informed the Census Bureau is when designing the question choices.\r\n\r\nOne current controversy surrounds the unavailability of a multiracial category. Many mixed race individuals do not know exactly how to answer question nine. They may feel constrained to pick one or two categories that they do not feel represent them in the most accurate way.\r\n\r\nDespite past mistakes, the Census is undeniably a useful tool to recognize and address serious issues that plague our communities. The fact that it is conducted only once every ten years makes it an even more significant project. The data collected this year will influence future policymaking and fund distribution in the future. Although there is still room for improvement in this year\u2019s Census, the one action we can take now is to spread the word on the importance of the Census, and hope that this time the \u201cSnapshot of America\u201d will start to look like a truly complete picture of our country.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out these links:\r\n\r\nCensus 2010: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.asianlawcaucus.org\/programs\/alc-redistricting-census\/census-2010\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.asianlawcaucus.org\/programs\/alc-redistricting-census\/census-2010\/<\/a>\r\n\r\nCAA Home Page: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.caasf.org\/v2\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.caasf.org\/v2\/<\/a>\r\n\r\nPCN Home Page: <a href=\"http:\/\/ucbpaapcn.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/ucbpaapcn.wordpress.com\/<\/a>\r\n\r\n[1] Hendricks, Tyche.

When people saw members of a UCSD fraternity dressing up as black stereotypes, the general consensus was some degree of shock, discomfort, or disgust. However, while people generally seemed to agree that this party was in poor taste and racially insensitive, there were differing opinions about what actions should be taken, or whether any action should be taken at all. When I initially discussed the Cookout and the incidents that followed with some of my friends who are students at UCSD and who were invited to this event, I expected us to be on the same page and to be able to commiserate about the hateful and ignorant nature of these incidents. Instead, I was met with head scratches and genuine concern that I had been at Berkeley for far too long. When the events were brought up in one of my discussion sections here at Cal, I was met with comments ridiculing the list of demands put forth by the Black Student Union of UCSD, and even assertions that we lived in a post-racial society where racism was out-of-date and irrelevant in the context of current events. When I attended the Blackout protest, I was moved by the strength and courage of the black students who stood arm in arm with cloths tied around their mouths. What I saw was a community coming together to express how they had been silenced by institutions and acts of hate. To me, their silence spoke volumes. To others, they were an inconvenient roadblock that disrupted the flow of their day. I was shocked when I overheard students say things like \"They're so rude for blocking my way to class,\" or \"They need to stop making such a big deal,\" and even \"Do they all go here? I didn't know we had that many black people.\" If you think like this, this single article won't persuade you to suddenly grow a consciousness. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who believes that the Compton Cookout and the incidents following are not isolated events, but are natural by-products of a society that lacks consciousness of race. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who tries to understand the historical and present-day struggle of marginalized peoples.

When people saw members of a UCSD fraternity dressing up as black stereotypes, the general consensus was some degree of shock, discomfort, or disgust. However, while people generally seemed to agree that this party was in poor taste and racially insensitive, there were differing opinions about what actions should be taken, or whether any action should be taken at all.\r\n\r\nWhen I initially discussed the Cookout and the incidents that followed with some of my friends who are students at UCSD and who were invited to this event, I expected us to be on the same page and to be able to commiserate about the hateful and ignorant nature of these incidents. Instead, I was met with head scratches and genuine concern that I had been at Berkeley for far too long.\r\n\r\nWhen the events were brought up in one of my discussion sections here at Cal, I was met with comments ridiculing the list of demands put forth by the Black Student Union of UCSD, and even assertions that we lived in a post-racial society where racism was out-of-date and irrelevant in the context of current events.\r\n\r\nWhen I attended the Blackout protest, I was moved by the strength and courage of the black students who stood arm in arm with cloths tied around their mouths. What I saw was a community coming together to express how they had been silenced by institutions and acts of hate. To me, their silence spoke volumes. To others, they were an inconvenient roadblock that disrupted the flow of their day. I was shocked when I overheard students say things like \"They're so rude for blocking my way to class,\" or \"They need to stop making such a big deal,\" and even \"Do they all go here? I didn't know we had that many black people.\"\r\n\r\nIf you think like this, this single article won't persuade you to suddenly grow a consciousness. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who believes that the Compton Cookout and the incidents following are not isolated events, but are natural by-products of a society that lacks consciousness of race. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who tries to understand the historical and present-day struggle of marginalized peoples. And I'm writing this as an Asian American woman who has experienced the realities of racial and gender inequalities in my everyday life, and who stands in solidarity with my black brothers and sisters when they are mistreated, silenced, underrepresented, and hated for being a person of color.\r\n\r\nThe list of demands put forth by the UCSD Black Student Union acknowledges how the campus climates across the UC\u2019s create conditions for this type of ignorance to fester.

With all of this rainy weather and the state\u2019s weary eyes still fixated on the UC\u2019s budget crisis, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the next catastrophe scheduled to make landfall in August 2012. No, I\u2019m not talking about the next *Big One* or even the end of the world (here\u2019s to you, Mayans!). The UC Regents clandestinely approved a landmark admissions policy last February under the banner of increasing racial and ethnic diversity within the UC system and possibly giving more students than ever before access to a world-class UC education. Unfortunately, this policy is not as innocuous or effective as it seems. In fact, multiple studies suggest that this policy could be* closing more educational opportunities than it opens *by decimating student diversity across the UC campuses. This policy introduces three major changes to the current admissions policy: \u201cit reduces the percentage of students guaranteed admission to a UC from the top 12.5% of statewide high school graduates to the top 10%; it eliminates the SAT II Subject Test as a UC requirement; and it increases the percentage of seniors who are guaranteed admission within each high school from the top 4% of a high school graduating class to the top 9%.\u201d[1] The intended effect of this policy, according to UC Regents, will be to increase the number of students eligible to apply to UC by as many as 30,000 students. Although UC President Mark Yudof claimed that \u201cfairness\u201d motivated the policy change, the new policy actually endangers UC\u2019s historic and pioneering commitment to supporting diversity and equal opportunity access to world-class education. The requisite 2.5% decrease in guaranteed admissions could potentially shut out thousands of African Americans, Latinos, and low-income Asians who typically occupy this band during a normal year. Past admissions statistics corroborate this possibility. According to a CPEC (California Postsecondary Education Commission) eligibility study, 50% fewer African Americans and 42% fewer Chicano\/Latinos would have been eligible for guaranteed admission had the policy been effective in 2007, compared to just 23% fewer whites. Also, by eliminating the SAT II testing requirement, the policy also gives the SAT I a more pronounced role in the admissions process. The policy inadvertently gives wealthy families an advantage in the admissions process because these families typically are able to afford expensive test-prep courses. APAs are not immune to the deleterious effects of this policy. The same CPEC study showed that 41% fewer Filipinos, 39% fewer Pacific Islanders, and 36% fewer Asian Americans would be eligible for guaranteed admission. The elimination of the SAT II also eliminates a test on which APAs typically excel, and one for which students with non-native English skills can study. Will Yudof's statement, \u201cAsians will be fine,\u201d glibly suggested in a *Los Angeles Times* interview in which he tried to defend this potential disaster, really hold true? Possibly, but if so, then it is at the expense of other minorities. If one window of opportunity opens, then another must close. A concerned coalition of APAs and other minorities on campus are mobilizing to oppose and increase awareness of the policy change. An outraged Ling-chi Wang, a retired professor of Ethnic Studies, went as far as to deride the policy as \"affirmative action for whites.\u201d[2] APIEL Now!, an Asian education and language advocacy group, recently organized a successful informational session, which was attended by Professor Emeritus Wang; former associate president of the UC, Pat Hayashi; students and community members; and a representative from the UC Regents. Recently released UC funded simulation studies that used advanced modeling techniques show that the new admissions policy will have, at best, a neutral impact on diversity. Of the three simulation studies conducted, two showed that it would have a devastating impact on diversity, while the most recent study showed that the policy would cause a negligible impact. A representative of the Academic Senate who attended the APIEL Now! forum summarily dismissed UC\u2019s own studies as \u201cunreliable.\u201d[3] His criticism suggests that these studies may have been conducted for the sole purpose of solidifying support for the policy rather than stimulating productive discussion. Many historians believe that history contains no great or categorical truths, only interpretations colored by our own environments \u2013 and this mess is no different. This issue is a sensitive and uncomfortable one; the debate is tainted by racial biases and by the self-interested motives of those financially or personally affected by the UC system. It conjures the specter of the passionate debate that surrounded Proposition 209, the infamous bill passed in 1996 that barred college admissions committees from considering race in their decisions. The stakes this time are arguably higher. Citing just one example among many, Hayashi writes that this new policy could have over twice the negative impact of Proposition 209 on African American admissions.[4] Yet the fact that Proposition 209 garnered widespread media attention and that the UC Regents invited local communities, minority groups, and students to debate the policy meant that the landmark policy change was fully scrutinized before its implementation. Quite egregiously, the UC Regents opened no public debate regarding this new admissions policy on the scale that it did for Proposition 209. The California Legislature\u2019s Asian and Pacific Islander caucus sent the UC Regents a letter requesting that they delay voting on the policy change until proper vetting had been done and a study disaggregating Asians into ethnic categories had taken place \u2013 only to be rebuffed and then ignored. Locally and regionally based minority organizations were not consulted at all about this policy. What happened to transparency? The clandestine nature of the policy\u2019s approval could be disguising the UC Regent\u2019s equally covert motives. While the policy does in fact drastically expand the applicant pool, these applicants are \u201centitled to review, but not guaranteed admission\u201d and therefore need to compete with out-of-state and international students. In combination with recent decisions to decrease the size of the incoming freshman class while increasing non-state enrollment by 11%, this means that the UC system stands to benefit financially from this policy. The UC\u2019s budget problems are well publicized and do not need to be discussed here \u2013 but a financial motive for this policy is both salient and significant. While UC Regents may have crafted this policy in good faith, the policy itself will counteract its stated goals of promoting fairness and increasing diversity; therefore, it is doomed to fail. Given the seemingly incontrovertible stance of the UC Regents regarding the implementation of this policy, collective action to oppose and garner awareness is needed now more than ever.

As a teenager growing up in the diverse public school system of San Francisco, though, I was able to learn Ethnic Studies lessons indirectly; in place of textbooks and lectures, I had life experiences and confrontations. But that doesn\u2019t mean these types of issues shouldn\u2019t be discussed. In fact, it\u2019s an even greater incentive to talk about them. The San Francisco Unified School District recently passed a measure to offer 10 Ethnic Studies classes in five of the city\u2019s high schools. The school board will designate $253,540 towards developing the Ethnic Studies curriculum. The end result: students will learn about a topic that applies to their daily lives, while earning six units of college credit.

George Washington High School senior Adrienne Tran discussed what she has learned from her volunteer work in Chinatown that was not taught in her regular history classes.

The classes are offered as a part of the California State University's Step to College program and targets students who may not consider college an option.

The Ethnic Studies program has gained the support of many local politicians and activists including School Board Vice President Jane Kim and Board Commissioner Sandra Lee Fewer. Other locals rallying for the program include Supervisor and former San Francisco State Ethnic Studies professor Eric Mar, as well as local organizations such as Pin@y Educational Partnerships, which works on creating a method of teaching and researching Filipina\/o American history. However, some controversy surrounds the cost of the program. People question why a school district that is struggling to make ends meet would accumulate more expenses. As a student in the Ethnic Studies Department, I\u2019d like to believe that it\u2019s worth it. San Francisco State University, one of the universities where Ethnic Studies was originally founded, has offered to train and assist teachers in order to lower the cost of the program.

Take picture?\u201d Over the four years I spent in China as a child, I was grabbed and tugged by the arm hundreds of times by strangers who all had the same curious and excited gleam in their eyes. My other foreign friends, who stood out in a sea of black-haired heads with their blonde hair and blue eyes, were also common targets of these harmless attacks. There always seemed to be a difference, though, in how the swift picture-takers treated me in comparison to the other kids. Since I am half-Chinese and half-white, I was the only one among us who looked kind of un-foreign, kind of like them. Sometimes this would render preferential treatment, as the picture-takers would say I was the most exotic looking one; other times, I was deemed not exotic enough to be in their pictures, and instead received confused glances as they turned away. I never knew which one was better or worse. Vivian S. Toy of the *New York Times* published an article last year relating the experience of her mixed children during their visit to Beijing. Her stories of picture-takers and that continuous question, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d recalled memories from my childhood. \u201cIt had become clear why my children were attracting so much attention. They look Chinese, but not exactly. They look Western, but not quite,\u201d Toy explained. In the same vein, an article titled \u201cMixed blood people get the best of both worlds\u201d was published on the *Shanghai Daily* website in September 2009. The article lists the numerous benefits of being mixed in China: mixed people are popular in the fashion and modeling industries because they\u2019re usually taller than most Chinese; they\u2019re perceived by many as \u201cmore attractive and more intelligent\u201d; those with an American parent don\u2019t have to study hard in school because they can go to a U.S. university; mixed babies are often used in product advertising; and mixed men are often approached by women for marriage. Patrick Liu, who wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the history of a mixed family living in Jiangsu Province, is cited in the article as stating that the \u201cattractive and intelligent\u201d stereotype surrounding people of mixed race \u201creflects both pride in Chinese culture and respect for foreign culture.\u201d The article goes on to state that in a homogenous society like China, where 93% of the population is Han Chinese, \u201cit is intriguing for people to see a different look, especially when the difference is mixed with similarities that are easy to understand\u201d \u2013 because, of course, it\u2019s easiest for us to understand people of our own race. So is it true then? Do \u201cmixed blood\u201d people really have the best of both worlds? For some, it\u2019s impossible to say yes. Take, for example, Lou Jing, a Chinese African-American girl born and raised in Shanghai who was interviewed in the *Shanghai Daily *article. While the article briefly mentions that Lou recently performed in a Chinese singing competition similar to \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d called \u201cGo Oriental Angel,\u201d it glosses over the spiteful attacks Lou received from much of the Chinese audience as she advanced in the show. In an interview with National Public Radio (NPR), Lou claimed that she had always thought of herself as \u201cShanghainese,\u201d and prior to the competition, did not realize she was \u201cdifferent\u201d \u2013 she had never met her African-American father, and her mother used to explain the darkness of her skin was due to too many herbal supplements taken during pregnancy. She didn't mind when she was nicknamed \u201cChocolate Angel\u201d and \u201cBlack Pearl\u201d on the show, but when Chinese netizens described her skin color as \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cugly,\u201d and criticized her mother for having a mixed child out of wedlock, Lou suffered a simultaneous identity crisis and emotional breakdown. Lou told her interviewers that \u201c[Even] if you beat me to death, I wouldn't take part in that competition again,\u201d and \u201cWhen I was younger, I thought life was beautiful. Why is it that now I've grown up, I don't think that anymore?\u201d So who is *Shanghai Daily* kidding? Not only does Lou not have \u201cthe best of both worlds,\u201d it\u2019s hard to say she even has one \u201cworld\u201d she feels she belongs in. Her case demonstrates that in an era of globalization, modern China still faces a little problem called racism at a time when it can least afford to. Lou\u2019s case is also an illustration of what happens when an isolated society suddenly becomes a world leader on both the commercial and cultural markets. After the fall of the last Chinese dynasty and throughout the Communist revolutions, immigration to China was strictly limited because the Chinese perceived foreigners as hostile and Western influences as poisonous to Chinese society. With the revitalization of the Open Door Policy in the 1980s, foreigners slowly trickled into China, but most were overseas Chinese. The coming decades saw increases in white European and American expatriates and tourists entering China, but numbers of Africans and African-Americans, Latin Americans, South Asians and Arabs remained small. Today, the world is beginning to view China the way it has viewed America since the latter\u2019s colonization \u2013 as a place of economic opportunity and prosperity. The immigration restrictions in America and Europe have also increased China\u2019s appeal. The \u201cChinese Dream\u201d has already taken hold in parts of Africa: the *New Yorker* reported last year on Guangzhou's \u201cLittle Africa,\u201d a part of the city inhabited by merchant class Africans of whom Nigerians make up the majority. Most inhabitants arrived after the opening of the Canaan Clothes Export Trading Center in Guangzhou, and spend their time \u201ccanvassing stalls for bargains and haggling with factories\u201d to purchase wholesale clothes to sell in Africa. This activity is reflected in the trade figure between China and Africa, which increased by about 700 percent to $73 billion from 2002 to 2007. According to the *New Yorker*, Guangzhou now houses some 20,000 African residents who constitute the city\u2019s largest foreign enclave. The quickly growing population of foreigners in China means that the Chinese perspective on race will be put into the international spotlight. It also means that the next few decades will see an increase in the number of \u201cmixed blood\u201d people in China. The conflicts between China's traditional conservative culture and the demands of rapid modernization are especially reflected in the oscillating attitude toward mixed people. For now, those who look more Chinese are generally more accepted than those who don\u2019t, as demonstrated by the differential treatment of Toy\u2019s children, myself, and Lou Jing. But to be fair to China, the U.S. has only recently begun to address its mixed population. The year 2000 was the first time the U.S. Census allowed people to check more than one box, instead of asking them to choose one they \u201cidentify the most with.\u201d A current Census estimate shows that the mixed population in the U.S. rose over three percent since 2008, making it the fastest growing demographic in the country, yet the lack of data regarding the mixed population means we have little insight about their political and social issues of concern. And when President Barack Obama identified himself as \u201cmixed\u201d once during his campaign in 2008, he received an uproar from the black community and never uttered the word again. These facts should not come as a relief to China that perhaps it isn\u2019t lagging too far behind the West. They should serve as a wake-up call. As the Chinese mixed population grows, China will need international attention and pressure to subdue the intense discrimination the likes of which Lou Jing and many others face. People of mixed race inevitably symbolize diversity and tolerance \u2013 ideas that all societies must learn to accept in this era of global interconnectedness. When I am able to visit China again, I hope to be shoved and pushed through the busy streets like the rest of the crowd without having to keep my guard up, keeping it cool as the only pictures of me are taken from my own camera, on my own time.\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>margaret zhou<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\u201cLittle girl, wait!

Specifically, the search company said that it is no longer willing to censor search results and recognizes that it may be compelled to discontinue its operations in China. Although Google has had a relatively stable relationship with China since 2005 and has thus far put up with its strict censorship policies, the compromised emails led Google to immediately antagonize the government as the one responsible for the attacks. Google wasn't the only company to be hacked in January; about a dozen high-profile companies, including Adobe, and several dozen smaller companies experienced security breaches. Both Adobe and Google have issued statements saying that the attacks may have compromised the security of their source code and other intellectual property. Google stated that the hackers obtained some limited data about two Gmail accounts, but not the full content of messages. No evidence was later found that the attacks came from the Chinese government, but the hackers were traced to mainland China. A recent article in *Wired *magazine states that the hack attack was very sophisticated. Initially, some speculated that the hacks were performed by the government in order to obtain data on human rights activists and high-profile source code, but the government denied all charges. A recent article by the New York Times posts that the U.S. National Security Agency has traced the attacks to two educational institutions in China, including one with close ties to the Chinese military. At a recent TED conference, Google's founder, Sergey Brin, speculated that business in China will continue, within the confines of Chinese laws and boundaries. Negotiations between China and Google now seem to be in favor of returning their relationship to the way it was before the attacks. However, until the source of the attacks is found, Google will still be apprehensive about its operations in China. The Chinese people, on the other hand, hold strong opinions regarding Google's response to the attacks and threat to withdraw. At the time of the attacks, I was vacationing in China and visiting some family and friends. We were at a family breakfast when the news came. My grandparents immediately erupted into debate. Having grown up during the Sino-Japanese War and witnessed the subsequent turbulent times of chaotic social and economic change in China, my grandparents were proud of their heritage and their country. My uncle joined, giving a speech about the economic invasion of China by foreign countries wishing to establish a foothold by \"tricking the hard-working Chinese people into addiction to their products just like in the Opium trades of Qing Dynasty.\" And there I was \u2013 a Google fan since Gmail rolled out in 2005 \u2013 believing Google to be the pinnacle of human technology because it seemed to disperse the knowledge of everything to the masses, and from what I interpreted based on the news, was also a proponent in the fight for media rights. Meanwhile, here was my own family, dissing and beating the crap out of my favorite search giant like a meatbag hung out to dry. (Our neighbors there had a couple of those.) But my family had a few good points. The Chinese people have always been the second child to Western countries, always getting the hand-me-downs. When the economic crisis struck in 2009, Chinese auto company Tengzhong almost bought the Hummer line from General Motors but the Ministry of Commerce rejected the offer; it was a broken deal over a failing line of autos that had so little value that GM discontinued it shortly after the rejection. Ford also announced in 2009 that the sale of the Volvo to Chinese manufacturer Geely would be completed in 2010 after a drop of 22 percent in U.S. sales. While the U.S. is the largest market for Chinese goods, it\u2019s also true that the U.S. sells back to China only a third of what it buys from China, and ranks fourth behind Japan at almost half of Japan's export value. The U.S. is falling into more debt to China every year, but the Chinese are getting bad deals from that debt. In 2005, China's commerce minister pointed out that the country needed to sell \"800 million shirts to buy a Boeing A380 airplane,\" pointing out the furthering imbalance of trade between China and the U.S. On the other hand, the U.S. market has been responsible for a lot of China's growth in the last few decades. The high-tech imports have blossomed China's economy and trade, in addition to providing more jobs and higher standards of living for the Chinese people. However, to the Chinese people today, the causes for dissatisfaction with the West often shadow these positive facts. In light of this sentiment, it was reasonable for Chinese citizens such as my grandparents to bear a grudge against Western companies. Chinese have a lot to be angry for. But many Chinese are divided on the issue as well. The announcement of Google's policy change sparked a variety of opinions on the Chinese blogosphere. While some bloggers were ecstatic about the possibility of Google leaving, others hoped in anguish for Google to return. An anonymous post on nfdaily.cn boasts: \"Google leaving? Because it cannot adopt to our policies or because it's not happy with its own?\" Robin Li of China Youth Net wrote, \"This is not the way Google should leave.\" Aside from being a search giant, Google also provides other services in China as it does in the U.S., such as Gmail, Google Reader, Maps, Google Docs, Youtube, Picasa, and numerous other web and desktop applications. As the second largest search provider in China after the Chinese company Baidu, Google holds a whopping 29 percent of the market share, the equivalent of all the other companies combined in the U.S. The number of people who use Google's services is growing every day both here and overseas. More and more Chinese are relying on Google\u2019s services for both personal and business uses. It's not hard to see why Google would be missed in China. And yet, Google has an image to live up to. The company's motto, \"Don't be evil,\" has been cited by many reports as the reason for Google to reject the Chinese government\u2019s demands for censorship and pull out. But I think that's the more reason for it to stay. Google was the first Western search company to not be blocked in China. More importantly, it is the only major search engine that informs its users that content is blocked when they search restricted sites, all the while refusing to provide information about its users to the government. Without Google, there is even less incentive for the government to lower the walls of censorship and for the people to climb the firewall. Without Google, there's even less reason for the Chinese to trust Western companies that provide a market for goods and provide a higher standard of living. Without Google, there's even less space for communication and negotiation between China and the Western world. Google has been instrumental in providing information to the masses in the 21st century in the United States, and should continue to spread ideas and fight for rights to knowledge in the rest of the world \u2013 China included.\n","html":"<em>the story from China's perspective<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>jingchen wu<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn January 12th, Google announced on its official blog that it was reconsidering its policies on content-filtering and censorship in China, citing a recent attack on its servers in which the email accounts of several human rights activists were compromised.

It is no surprise that Konietzko wishes to disassociate himself from Paramount Pictures\u2019 casting in the live-action film adaptation of his cartoon series. \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender\u201d is explicitly set in a world rooted in Asian aesthetics and culture, yet Paramount Pictures has made the decision to cast Caucasian actors to portray the show\u2019s lead characters. This is yet another blatant case of \u201cwhitewashing,\u201d the portrayal of Asian characters by white actors and actresses. The phenomenon of whitewashing in Hollywood is not new. The 2008 film \u201c21\u201d created controversy when it replaced the story\u2019s Asian characters with a primarily white cast. The film was based on the novel \u201cBring Down the House\u201d in which the protagonist Kevin Lewis is Asian. In the 2009 live-action American film adaptation of popular anime series \u201cDragon Ball Z,\u201d the protagonist was played by a white actor despite the distinctly Asian identity of the cartoon character. Just back in December, we saw a case of whitewashing with the release of \u201cExtraordinary Measures.\u201d This movie was based on the real-life story of Dr. Yuan-Tsong Chen developing a cure for Pompe disease at Duke University. Yet there was no Dr. Yuan-Tsong Chen in the movie. Instead, there was Dr. Robert Stonehill played by Harrison Ford \u2013 who, of course, is white. The marginalization of Asian American actors and actresses is a prevalent trend in the mainstream film industry. For some reason, movie studios seem to believe that if they cast non-white actors, the American public will be unable to relate to their characters onscreen. This belief is utter bullshit. Look around us. Is America 99.9% white? If James Cameron and 20th Century Fox can get away with telling a story about giant blue people, why can\u2019t Paramount make a film with Asian American lead actors? It\u2019s ridiculous that the film industry will produce movies about talking fish, kung-fu fighting pandas, and green ogres, but won\u2019t allow Asian American actors to play Asian characters. If Americans can relate to giant blue people with tails in Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar,\u201d then who\u2019s to say they can\u2019t relate to Asian American actors and characters? There is no legitimate reason for Paramount to cast white actors as the lead characters in this adaptation. \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender\u201d is strongly influenced by elements of Asian culture. The show\u2019s writers have characterized the setting as an \u201cancient, fantastical world, primarily Chinese.\u201d Most importantly, the characters themselves are of Asian descent. The protagonist Aang dresses as a Shaolin monk and even writes in traditional Chinese calligraphy. The characters Katara and Sokka wear traditional Inuit clothing and use Inuit tools. Now, why shouldn\u2019t actors and actresses of Asian descent portray these characters? Instead, Paramount has decided to cast Caucasian actors for the roles of all three. However, it\u2019s interesting that the antagonist Zuko\u2019s character will be portrayed by Dev Patel of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d fame. Patel, who is of South Asian descent, and the other actors playing villains from the Fire Nation are all distinctly dark-skinned, while the actors cast as the heroes are light-skinned. Paramount\u2019s color-coded casting perpetuates the notion that people of color are always the bad guys, while the ones that save the day are white. If the skin-color distinction between the heroes and villains were not racist enough, the casting call for extras goes even further. Paramount called for people of \u201cNear Eastern, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, Asian, Mediterranean, and Latino\u201d descent to play the negligible background characters. This casting call plainly marginalizes people of color as secondary characters while excluding them from leading roles. Paramount\u2019s casting call also encouraged prospective extras to audition in \u201ctraditional ethnic attire.\u201d But, when asked whether they would be disadvantaged if they did not dress in \u201cethnic\u201d clothing, casting director Deedee Ricketts said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re at a disadvantage if you didn\u2019t come in a big African thing. But guys, even if you came with a scarf today, put it over your head so you\u2019ll look like a Ukrainian villager or whatever.\u201d Big African thing? Ukrainian villager or whatever? Can Paramount sound any more ignorant? Even worse, Ricketts\u2019 statements reinforce the idea that people of color are foreign and not \u201cAmerican.\u201d The American film industry has excluded Asian actors from principal roles throughout history: recall the castings of Caucasians Warner Oland as the iconic Dr. Fu Manchu and Audrey Hepburn as Jade Tan in the 1940s film \u201cDragon Seed.\u201d In the past century, America has experienced a civil rights movement and the election of its first biracial president, but the film industry cannot seem to overcome its racist attitudes and allow Asian actors and actresses to get their foot through the door into Hollywood. After over a century since its rise, the American film industry still has not reformed its discriminatory casting policies. This means that today, we as viewers and consumers need to be the ones to initiate an overhaul of the system from the outside. As movie-goers, we have the power to boycott a movie. If the sole goal of movie studios is to bring in the big bucks, then we have the power to say, \u201cNo.\u201d No, we\u2019re not going to pay to see a movie that blatantly marginalizes not just one group of people, but a multitude of different ethnic groups.

Whites, however, are not the only minority within the NBA. There are not many Latino players in the NBA, and even fewer Asians. Lewis insists that there was no racism behind the establishment of this league, but the appearances do not lend his claim credit. For one, even the name of the league is exclusionary and politically incorrect. What makes someone with two Caucasian parents exclusively \u201cAll-American\u201d? Being \u201cAmerican\u201d does not equate with being white. Being \u201cAmerican\u201d means that you were born in the United States, or have become a naturalized citizen. It has nothing to do with your race or ethnicity. This incendiary name compounded with the segregation in the league invokes the outdated racist notion that whites are somehow more legitimate Americans than people of color. Why is the so-called All-American Basketball League so problematic? After all, ethnic-specific teams have existed for a while now, and continue to be a valuable part of many communities. For instance, Japanese Americans in California already have their own basketball league. The original Japanese American League (J-League), created for high school and young adult Japanese Americans, was founded in the 1920s out of necessity due to racial and ethnic discrimination. J-League player Robert Koga explains that this league was formed because \u201cthere were no other places for them to play at the time\u2026[because of] size differential, because of segregation; they really had nowhere else to play.\u201d[3] Especially since Japanese Americans have become so geographically spread out, J-Leagues today have helped bring Japanese American youth together and foster a sense of community. Without this program, many Japanese American youth would have little to no connection to the larger Japanese American community. Much like the All-American Basketball League, J-Leagues have faced controversy due to qualifications that required a certain number of players to be at least part Japanese American. Many felt that these rules were exclusionary and that race and ethnicity should not be mandatory eligibility requirements, as these leagues were created under the context that Japanese Americans themselves were being excluded. In response, J-Leagues have updated the rules to allow people of other races and ethnicities to join. In contrast, members of the All-American Basketball League have not experienced issues of discrimination like those of the J-League have. They have not been excluded from playing on mainstream teams due to their race or ethnicity, and they are not a marginalized group within the NBA. It is doubtful the establishment of this league will help foster a greater sense of community for whites; those on the team are most likely on it simply because they cannot make it into the NBA, not because they feel that they are missing out on a sense of white ethnic community. It is problematic to advocate such blatant discrimination in an alternate professional league just because whites are a minority in the mainstream NBA league. Whites are not even the smallest minority within the NBA; Asian Americans are represented to a far lesser degree than whites, and yet, we are not starting our own professional league. For many Asian Americans, height continues to be a barrier to being scouted, as most are not as tall as their peers of other races. Most Asian American youth take a more positive spin on their lack of representation in the NBA, though, by continuing to enjoy watching and playing the sport. Getting drafted into the NBA is a great honor that many individuals spend their lives training for. Perhaps a majority of players are black, but they have worked for it and are selected for their skill. The All-American Basketball League, if it survives its first season at all, will only set the precedent for other races to set up their own leagues, taking us back to the pre-1960s era of segregation. While racial and ethnic solidarity are valuable, this so-called \u201cAll-American\u201d league lacks any feeling of solidarity, and instead creates a division between Americans where there should be none.

Doesn\u2019t that count as a minority?\u201d I scratched my head, thought, and said, \u201cWell sure, I suppose\u2026but what does that make queer people of color? A minority within a minority?\u201d When I discovered that there were queer organizations on campus specific for people of color, such as Snaps \u2013 Queer People of Color (QPOC), it just didn\u2019t make sense to me. In my head, I thought that all queer people were fighting the same fight for equality and social justice. While it seems as if queerness is more accepted in this day and age, the harsh reality is that queer communities still face much hostility and discrimination. Now you may wonder why there exist separate communities of queers \u2013 does being queer and colored really make a difference? The answer is a hard and resounding yes. These queer and colored communities are absolutely marginalized. In fact, queer people of color do not necessarily have spaces in society to explore what it means to be gay and a person of color. More often than not, queer characters in media are white, middle class folks. Just look at \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cWill and Grace,\u201d \u201cEllen,\u201d and \u201cUgly Betty.\u201d Similarly, the face of the gay rights movement mirrors media in assuming that only white people are gay. For instance, the lesbian feminist movement developed as a movement of \u2013 guess what? \u2013 predominantly white, middle-class women. This is very problematic for queer communities of color; it sheds light on how gay rights movements and the media can completely ignore the very complex experiences of queer people of color. Founder of Snaps \u2013 QPOC Kenny Gong asserts that \u201corganizations like Snaps \u2013 QPOC examine these \u2018*and*\u2019 experiences \u2013 gay and Asian, gay and Black, gay and closeted, and the list goes on and on. At Snaps \u2013 QPOC, the \u2018*and*\u2019 identities can be explored. We wanted to focus on building a space that didn\u2019t exist [before]\u2026focused on finding identity, being accepted, turning dialogue into application and creating a movement.\u201d For queer people of color, it is not just about being queer but about the intersectionality of race, class, culture and sexuality. After all, many people of color are brought together by shared experiences of similar economic upbringings, racial discrimination and coming from families that have recently immigrated to the United States and thus, carried their country\u2019s values over with them. No one quite understands these experiences unless he or she has gone through them personally. Thus, being queer and colored can be an absolutely unique experience and the reason why a space for queer people of color has been demanded. Junior Jorge Flores echoes these thoughts: \u201cFamily in Latino culture, just as Asian culture, is very important. It\u2019s all centered on the family so for me, it was very difficult coming out. Being gay and colored can be completely different than just being gay and white because minorities go through racism, poor upbringings or fewer opportunities\u2026things non-minorities may not experience.\u201d As mentioned previously in Kenny Gong\u2019s earlier statement on discovering these \u201cand\u201d identities, finding a community of people like yourself can mean everything. When I asked Nathaniel Nguyen of Chapman University whether he felt there was a difference between being queer and colored versus being queer and white, he said, \u201cAbsolutely\u2026Asian culture is more tied to tradition so it makes it more difficult for the evolution of thoughts and ideas about homosexuality to occur. A forum is important because the expression of feelings helps a minority within a minority to cope.\u201d Then again, it is too ambiguous and problematic to make generalizations about Asian culture by just bluntly saying or alluding to the idea that \u201cAsians don\u2019t like gay people.\u201d In fact, across many cultures and religions, homosexuality has yet to enter the vocabulary and is treated in a discriminatory manner that is justified through conservative values, culture and religion. However, homophobia has interesting roots within Asian culture. In the 1990s, the concept of \u201cAsian Values\u201d arose as a popular argument in justifying several Asian countries\u2019 terrible human rights records. Originating in Singapore and Malaysia, the Asian Values argument asserted that Asian countries had a distinctive set of ideologies and institutions that reflected an anti-colonial, anti-universalism and anti-Western culture. In essence, it said that Asian cultures valued community over the individual, hierarchy over equality, and economic and social development over civil and political freedom. This concept resonated within many political circles in Asia because it offered an alternative to Western ideology. These Asian Values rested heavily on Confucian beliefs. One of the foremost Confucian obligations is to continue the ancestral (male) line and have a family. The inability of the homosexual individual to have a traditional family casts that individual as a strange and wild outcast of society. Therefore, those who enter into homosexual relationships within Singapore, specifically men, are subject to imprisonment, among various other legal obstacles to their rights for equality, simply because their conduct goes against Confucian beliefs and culture. In other words, Asian countries can do whatever the hell they want and imprison whoever the hell they want in the name of Asian Values and say that it\u2019s all for the sanctity of their cultural beliefs. The Asian Values concept presents serious challenges to the dialogue on the queer rights movement. Although this concept may appear empowering to Asian nation-states as an alternative to Western ideology, the Asian Values debate is extremely problematic in that it makes broad generalizations about Asian culture as lacking in human rights, oppressive, and non-progressive. Furthermore, the suggestion that a set of \u201cuniversal Asian values\u201d exists is dangerous because it homogenizes the various cultures in Asia through the idea that all Asian countries share a similar \u201cculture\u201d and are thus inclined one way simply because they are Asian. While homophobia may be related to experiences in specific Asian countries or experiences tied to widely-related ideologies or religions, it is very dangerous to say that all Asians are against queer people because of Asian culture or values. At the end of the day, the distinction between cultural and ethical rights is pretty damn ambiguous. Sure, boundaries are fluid and disputed all the time. Yes, the definitions of what is right or wrong are always changing in response to social, political, economic and cultural factors. No, we do not have the same culture in America as we did 100 years ago \u2013 racism is definitely not tolerated now as it was back then. And sure, what may be imperative to me may not be imperative to another person living on the opposite side of the globe. But, we need to be careful in how we refer to and present queerness. It is absolutely essential to discover and explore these complex \u201c*and*\u201d identities and experiences within organizations like Snaps \u2013 QPOC. Too often, these very experiences are overshadowed and ignored. As Kenny Gong mentions, \u201cWe must fill in the gaps, start conversations about queer people of color and hopefully have Snaps \u2013 QPOC as a part of the Queer People of Color movement.\u201d Who knows what the future will hold for queer rights, but these existing organizations are leaps and strides in the right direction so that in the future no one will ever feel simply like a minority within a minority.\n\n\n","html":"exploring what it means to be a queer person of color\r\n\r\nby <strong>tran ngo<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAsked by one of my white queer friends not too long ago: \u201cI\u2019m gay. Doesn\u2019t that count as a minority?\u201d\r\n\r\nI scratched my head, thought, and said, \u201cWell sure, I suppose\u2026but what does that make queer people of color? A minority within a minority?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen I discovered that there were queer organizations on campus specific for people of color, such as Snaps \u2013 Queer People of Color (QPOC), it just didn\u2019t make sense to me. In my head, I thought that all queer people were fighting the same fight for equality and social justice. While it seems as if queerness is more accepted in this day and age, the harsh reality is that queer communities still face much hostility and discrimination. Now you may wonder why there exist separate communities of queers \u2013 does being queer and colored really make a difference?\r\n\r\nThe answer is a hard and resounding yes. These queer and colored communities are absolutely marginalized. In fact, queer people of color do not necessarily have spaces in society to explore what it means to be gay and a person of color. More often than not, queer characters in media are white, middle class folks. Just look at \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cWill and Grace,\u201d \u201cEllen,\u201d and \u201cUgly Betty.\u201d\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the face of the gay rights movement mirrors media in assuming that only white people are gay. For instance, the lesbian feminist movement developed as a movement of \u2013 guess what? \u2013 predominantly white, middle-class women. This is very problematic for queer communities of color; it sheds light on how gay rights movements and the media can completely ignore the very complex experiences of queer people of color.\r\n\r\nFounder of Snaps \u2013 QPOC Kenny Gong asserts that \u201corganizations like Snaps \u2013 QPOC examine these \u2018<em>and<\/em>\u2019 experiences \u2013 gay and Asian, gay and Black, gay and closeted, and the list goes on and on. At Snaps \u2013 QPOC, the \u2018<em>and<\/em>\u2019 identities can be explored. We wanted to focus on building a space that didn\u2019t exist [before]\u2026focused on finding identity, being accepted, turning dialogue into application and creating a movement.\u201d For queer people of color, it is not just about being queer but about the intersectionality of race, class, culture and sexuality.\r\n\r\nAfter all, many people of color are brought together by shared experiences of similar economic upbringings, racial discrimination and coming from families that have recently immigrated to the United States and thus, carried their country\u2019s values over with them. No one quite understands these experiences unless he or she has gone through them personally. Thus, being queer and colored can be an absolutely unique experience and the reason why a space for queer people of color has been demanded.\r\n\r\nJunior Jorge Flores echoes these thoughts: \u201cFamily in Latino culture, just as Asian culture, is very important.

One officer, who grew up in apartments across from the I-Hotel, reaffirmed that there was no such thing as an active Manilatown \u2013 there were no Filipino restaurants, businesses, etc. This same officer stated, \u201cThere ain\u2019t nothing left of Manilatown but the I-Hotel, and even that has been rebuilt.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;\">After nearly getting lost, circling around Kearny Street looking for some big obvious sign that would point me towards Manilatown, and asking around, I finally realized I WAS standing in Manilatown!<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: small;\">I was so disappointed to realize that this Manilatown that I have heard and studied so much about was now contained in a mere two blocks. How can a place that has been and is so culturally and historically rich fail to be acknowledged? More attention definitely needs to be drawn to Manilatown in order to acknowledge the history and struggle of the individuals who fought for the resurrection of the I-Hotel as well as the Manilatown space. Manilatown must be explored by individuals of our generation, to devise a plan of possibly expanding it with more local restaurants, stores, cultural organizations, etc. If this interests you, I encourage you to discuss it with Ethnic Studies or Asian American Professors such as Harvey Dong.<\/span>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":21,"created_at":"Wed, 07 Apr 2010 18:15:13 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 22:34:32 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 07 Apr 2010 18:15:13 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":925,"title":"if you stand in the middle of the road, you're going to get run over","slug":"if-you-stand-in-the-middle-of-the-road-youre-going-to-get-run-over","markdown":"\nDivestment. It's been a big word lately. Senate Bill 118, to take away UC funds from companies investing in weapons that contribute to war crimes in Palestine, was passed by the ASUC a month ago. The senators voted 16-4 in favor of passing the bill, only to be vetoed by President Will Smelko. Tonight the Senate met and listened to public comment after public comment to decide whether or not to overturn the veto. I'm not here to lament the lack of sleep I got from staying for the entire 8.5 hour duration of the meeting (10:30 pm - 7 am). I'm not here to air my personal opinion about the bill itself or some of the speakers I heard. I'm not even here to write with frustrated resignation about the fact that after 8.5 hours, the motion to override the veto was tabled, in hopes of a compromise brought up in the last hour. I'm here to call someone out. Her name starts with an M. Rhymes with inji. Will the real Minji Kim please stand up? 13 senators voted to override Smelko's veto, but 14 were needed. Kim was the abstention that could have swung the vote the other way. She said [these are not direct quotes, as my memory is rather faulty after an all-nighter] the ASUC does not have the right to decide the course of human lives.\u00a0 She did not feel comfortable speaking for people whose lives might either be saved, eradicated, or displaced by her decision. In the last month since the bill was first put to a vote, Kim said she did not have enough knowledge to vote one way or the other. There is humility. And then there is foolishness. It is an abuse of power to abstain from voting when you assumed a political office claiming to represent your constituents. I am not asking you to stray from your conscience; I am asking how members of my ASUC can fail their responsibility. In the end, how is Kim any better an advocate than those who did not gain a seat in the Senate? By refraining from taking a political stand, no matter how hard the decision, Kim is betraying the trust of her voters to listen to them. She stated that of the numerous e-mails she received, not one of them told her to abstain. Perhaps those writers caught onto something she did not. There is no room for apathy anymore. If you seek power and are privileged enough to vote on issues with global implications, there's no reason to not use that power. I do not understand how abstaining from this bill was any higher a moral ground than those who voted for or against it. Through her silence, Kim, willingly or not, supports Smelko's veto. She acknowledged that it might be viewed as a cop-out. Well, in colloquial terms, DUH. If you are too afraid of the backlash of your decision, just say so, and I'll respect you for your honesty. As it is, I cannot respect a senator, irrespective of political party affiliation, who stands for nothing. For the first time since being at Berkeley, I came to understand today how people can become so disenchanted that they start to withdraw and just not care. If Kim, as an elected representative of the student body, cannot use her office, she serves as a sorry model for years to come. Justice doesn't sleep. Apparently, neither does apathy.\n\n\n","html":"Divestment.\r\n\r\nIt's been a big word lately.

It\u2019s what hardboiled stands for and it\u2019s certainly been the theme of many campus events for the past month. If you meet our members, you\u2019ll come to find that they often spread themselves too thin. They\u2019re active in possibly every single organization on campus because they want to make change not just on this campus, but in this country. This was definitely not what I expected when I first dropped into the DeCal meeting that Wednesday night two years ago. At first I joined hardboiled for the journalism experience because I thought that writing feature articles would be my contribution to the world and that photography was my opportunity to become an artist. Now, I realize that I\u2019m lucky if I can write a coherent sentence or take a picture that isn\u2019t washed out. For a while, I seriously considered leaving and relieving hardboiled of my lack of talent. But while I do sometimes wonder what use I am to the group, I do not doubt what hardboiled has taught me. This organization supports you in all your endeavors just like how your friends would make it a priority to make it to your first performance because they know it means the world to you to simply have them standing in the crowd cheering their lungs out, all for you. And that\u2019s what this club is doing and has been doing the last thirteen years \u2013 for you. hardboiled was out there campaigning for our very own alumni, marching against UC privatization, and screaming for this month\u2019s mass of culture shows. hardboiled cares. We genuinely do. And it is the passion of my fellow staff and core that fuels my own motivation. I don\u2019t say this because I should. I have no reason to, especially after having spent some pretty pathetic Friday nights this past year putting the issue together before it went to print. I say this because when I walk down Sproul, I think of that morning last year when Eunice chased me down to chat. I say this because when I walk by Chipotle, I think of Cecilia and Kat\u2019s bottomless stomach. I say this because when I\u2019m miserable in NYC this fall, I\u2019ll have Monte convince me that professional school is awesome despite the fact that we\u2019re freezing and in debt. In every issue, hardboiled is angry, advocating and promoting dialogue. We do this through our writing and through our design, hoping that something will grab you, our readers, and inspire you to pass on the knowledge. We\u2019re a community. It\u2019s safe to expect us to be there for you, to believe in you, and to want to see you succeed. This is why I\u2019ve stayed around for so long. And this is why you should fall in love with hardboiled just like I have. But breaking up is inevitable and now it\u2019s time for me to move on with my life. It\u2019s not you hardboiled, it\u2019s me. I have to graduate and move across the country, but I know that you will continue making your mark as always.

It's been a pretty big word here on campus these past few weeks. It's a word I have seen people cry about, people scream about, and people pray about. It's a word that has inspired within me both a profound sense of hope and an acute sense of urgency. All of these emotions come from a bill proposed by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) in ASUC Senate. This bill is SB118A, \"A Bill in Support of UC Divestment from War Crimes.\" **What is SB118A? ** The bill does three main things: it details and condemns war crimes committed by Israel; it urges UC divestment from General Electric and United Technologies as well as any other companies which materially support or profit from Israel's war crimes; and it creates a task force to investigate whether the ASUC or UC invests in any companies which aid in war crimes worldwide. However, while the bill passed 16-4 in Senate on March 17th, a week later it was vetoed by ASUC President Will Smelko. The bill was then brought up again in Senate in an attempt to overturn the veto. After a nine hour Senate meeting and turnout of over 400 people, the Senate tabled the bill until its next meeting on April 28th. The senators collectively received over 25,000 emails both in support of and opposition to the bill. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader in the South African anti-apartheid movement, even commended the ASUC for the bill's initial passage. **What does this bill have the potential to do?** You may ask, \u201cHow are the results tangible? What exactly will divestment do?\u201d Some of our tuition to the University is directly invested in General Electric and United Technologies, two companies which manufacture the weapons used by Israel in war crimes. While the ASUC does not invest in General Electric or United Technologies, it can advocate that the University divest the $135 million it has invested in these companies. In addition to saving lives, divesting from General Electric and United Technologies will signal to other universities and to the world that as global citizens and intellectuals, we will not condone war crimes. As Naomi Klein put it, this is the beginning of building a \"grassroots, non-violent movement to end Israel's violations of international law.\" By building this movement to divest, we can save the lives of Palestinians who are attacked by machines built and supplied by U.S. companies supported by the millions of dollars that we contribute to the University every year. **How exactly do Palestinians suffer?** A few of the war crimes (taken from the United Nation's Goldstone Report) detailed in the bill include the following: A 32 month blockade on Gaza, including a tightening of policies regarding permission to exit Gaza for medical purposes. A severe shortage of medications and medical supplies for thousands of Palestinian patients. Electricity, water, and fuel denied to 1.5 million people, 90 percent of whom depend on aid for survival. The January 4th killing of Palestinian medical aid workers by General Electric assault helicopters. The bombing of schools, homes, and civilians by United Technology Blackhawk helicopters. However, while SB118A has the potential to change thousands of lives, it is not without opposition. At the Senate meeting to overturn the veto, there were a number of arguments against the passage of the bill. While I'm not discounting the individual experiences of the students on this campus who testified, I do have to point out a few things about some of the common arguments that I heard. **\"This bill is anti-Semitic. It makes students feel unsafe on campus.\" ** At the Senate meeting on April 14th, a number of Jewish students spoke emotionally, describing how the passage of this bill would make them feel unsafe, oppressed, and the target of anti-Semitism on campus. Although they may feel this way, many other Jewish students as well as students of many other communities also spoke in favor of the bill. They explained how if the bill DOESN'T pass, they will feel unsafe on a campus which refuses to, in essence, denounce war crimes when it has the chance. In addition, it's important to note that Palestinians who are denied access to clean water are OPPRESSED. Palestinians who have bombs dropped on them and undergo continuous helicopter attacks feel UNSAFE. Palestinians who are refused access to medical care or medication and die are TARGETED. Palestinians are oppressed, endangered, and targeted. Their lives are threatened every day. This bill is NOT an attack on the Jewish community. It is not anti-Semitic to criticize the Israeli government because it has committed war crimes. This is about rejecting acts of violence that violate international laws and not about denouncing a people. It is about sending the message that America cannot turn a blind eye to Israel\u2019s actions regardless of their geopolitical alliance. **\"This bill causes divisions on campus.\" ** Rather than being wholly divisive, this bill has brought together over 40 student groups who supported divestment. It is creating a way for diverse communities to come together for a common purpose. In recognizing the injustices and human rights violations experienced by Palestinians, the ASUC is sending the message to other marginalized communities that their issues are important as well. By recognizing the plight of the Palestinians, the ASUC sends the message that it stands for justice for all communities, whether or not their struggles are heard or legitimized by the U.S. government. However, the reality is that the divisions on this campus made apparent because of SB118A had existed long before the bill was even drafted. Yes, some students are divided. Some students disagree with each other, and some students are even arguing with each other. However, the lives and well-being of Palestinians are far too important to maintain the status quo just so that people who disagree can stop arguing for the time being. As it stands, regardless of whether or not the bill passes, students on this campus will be crying \u2013 either in happiness, because their university has taken a moral and ethical position to stand up to war crimes and denounce the killing of people, or in sadness, because they feel that the ASUC Senate has passed a bill with which they disagree politically and personally. Not everyone can be pleased, but I hope that on Wednesday we listen to those who have the most at stake. The war crimes, the violence, the killing, and the denial of basic needs must stop, and the ASUC has the power to begin this end. **\"This bill unfairly targets Israel, while ignoring Palestinian war crimes.\" ** SB118A does focus specifically on Israeli war crimes. While both Israeli and Palestinian war crimes are well documented in the United Nation\u2019s Goldstone report, the focus of this bill is on Israel because the University is directly invested in companies which provide weapons to Israel. Because Hamas, the Palestinian governing body, is classified as a terrorist organization, no American company would ever be able to legally build weapons that go towards Palestinian war crimes. This bill does not claim that Palestinian war crimes do not happen, nor do any of its advocates support violence against Jews or those living in Israel. This bill is about divestment, not about placing blame or keeping score on who has committed the most war crimes. If we are concerned about taking sides, the fact of the matter is that we are already on a side by having these investments. This bill is primarily about where we, as students, are allowing the University to invest our money in our name. The most neutral thing to do would actually be to divest because we're already invested. To divest would be to remove ourselves from Israeli\/Palestinian issues. Why not do so and put our student fees elsewhere? In addition, the bill also calls for the ASUC to investigate if any of the ASUC and\/or UC funds are being invested in companies which support war crimes, and to make recommendations of additional divestment policies involving these companies. The bill lists Morocco and the Congo as two other places in which war crimes are occurring and that the ASUC could possibly divest from. As a student and someone who does not support war or violence, I hope it will be the first of many bills which lead the ASUC and the University to be more socially responsible in their investments. **What now?** And so this is what I ask of you: What will you do to put an end to all of this? What will YOU do to stop YOUR money from being used to fund the weapons and machinery used to kill Palestinians? How can you, in any way, justify not doing ANYTHING within your power to put an end to this? Let me remind you again that we're already financing the weapons used in war crimes through our student fees. We're already guilty in our complacency. We're already guilty in our inaction, and we're twice as guilty if we sit around and let this bill fail. In our inaction we are supporting Israeli war crimes. Actually, let me give it to you straight. Let me tell you exactly how I see it, through the complex arguments, flowery language, and emotional manipulation. Let me lay it out for you: Do you or do you not condone people dying? People being killed? Forget the term \"war crimes\" even. The reality of \"war crimes\" is that 711,000 Palestinians have died since 1948. In late 2008 and early 2009, over 1,400 Palestinians were killed during the Gaza War by weapons that we, as UC Berkeley students, have funded. Is this okay with you? I sure as hell know it's not okay with me. I understand that doing the right thing is rarely easy or popular. Challenging the status quo is always a messy business involving loud and persistent critics. Injustices exist because it's often easier to walk away than it is to challenge these critics. However, I urge you NOT to walk away. I plead with you NOT to be complacent. Be angry, be upset, be sad, be outraged, be scared, but whatever you do, don't be complacent. Don't let SB118A fail. You are guilty in your complacency. You are implicated in your complacency. In your complacency, there is blood on your hands and THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING. The whole world is watching, and in the words of Archibshop Desmond Tutu, \"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\" **What Can I Do?**- Write a letter to a senator explaining why you want him or her to support SB118A. Drop it off at the Senators\u2019 mailboxes located on the second floor of Eshleman, or go to www.asuc.org.\n- Come to the Senate meeting on Wednesday, April 28th at 7:30 p.m. in Pauley Ballroom in the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union.\n- Educate your friends and promote dialogue on SB118A.\n\n\n","html":"<em>A Breakdown of the ASUC Divestment Bill<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>annie kim noguchi<\/strong>\r\n\r\nDivestment.

They explained how if the bill DOESN'T pass, they will feel unsafe on a campus which refuses to, in essence, denounce war crimes when it has the chance.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it's important to note that Palestinians who are denied access to clean water are OPPRESSED. Palestinians who have bombs dropped on them and undergo continuous helicopter attacks feel UNSAFE. Palestinians who are refused access to medical care or medication and die are TARGETED. Palestinians are oppressed, endangered, and targeted. Their lives are threatened every day.\r\n\r\nThis bill is NOT an attack on the Jewish community. It is not anti-Semitic to criticize the Israeli government because it has committed war crimes. This is about rejecting acts of violence that violate international laws and not about denouncing a people. It is about sending the message that America cannot turn a blind eye to Israel\u2019s actions regardless of their geopolitical alliance.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"This bill causes divisions on campus.\" <\/strong>\r\n\r\nRather than being wholly divisive, this bill has brought together over 40 student groups who supported divestment. It is creating a way for diverse communities to come together for a common purpose. In recognizing the injustices and human rights violations experienced by Palestinians, the ASUC is sending the message to other marginalized communities that their issues are important as well. By recognizing the plight of the Palestinians, the ASUC sends the message that it stands for justice for all communities, whether or not their struggles are heard or legitimized by the U.S. government.\r\n\r\nHowever, the reality is that the divisions on this campus made apparent because of SB118A had existed long before the bill was even drafted. Yes, some students are divided. Some students disagree with each other, and some students are even arguing with each other. However, the lives and well-being of Palestinians are far too important to maintain the status quo just so that people who disagree can stop arguing for the time being.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, regardless of whether or not the bill passes, students on this campus will be crying \u2013 either in happiness, because their university has taken a moral and ethical position to stand up to war crimes and denounce the killing of people, or in sadness, because they feel that the ASUC Senate has passed a bill with which they disagree politically and personally.\r\n\r\nNot everyone can be pleased, but I hope that on Wednesday we listen to those who have the most at stake. The war crimes, the violence, the killing, and the denial of basic needs must stop, and the ASUC has the power to begin this end.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"This bill unfairly targets Israel, while ignoring Palestinian war crimes.\" <\/strong>\r\n\r\nSB118A does focus specifically on Israeli war crimes. While both Israeli and Palestinian war crimes are well documented in the United Nation\u2019s Goldstone report, the focus of this bill is on Israel because the University is directly invested in companies which provide weapons to Israel. Because Hamas, the Palestinian governing body, is classified as a terrorist organization, no American company would ever be able to legally build weapons that go towards Palestinian war crimes.\r\n\r\nThis bill does not claim that Palestinian war crimes do not happen, nor do any of its advocates support violence against Jews or those living in Israel. This bill is about divestment, not about placing blame or keeping score on who has committed the most war crimes.\r\n\r\nIf we are concerned about taking sides, the fact of the matter is that we are already on a side by having these investments. This bill is primarily about where we, as students, are allowing the University to invest our money in our name. The most neutral thing to do would actually be to divest because we're already invested. To divest would be to remove ourselves from Israeli\/Palestinian issues. Why not do so and put our student fees elsewhere?\r\n\r\nIn addition, the bill also calls for the ASUC to investigate if any of the ASUC and\/or UC funds are being invested in companies which support war crimes, and to make recommendations of additional divestment policies involving these companies. The bill lists Morocco and the Congo as two other places in which war crimes are occurring and that the ASUC could possibly divest from.\r\n\r\nAs a student and someone who does not support war or violence, I hope it will be the first of many bills which lead the ASUC and the University to be more socially responsible in their investments.\r\n\r\n<strong>What now?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAnd so this is what I ask of you: What will you do to put an end to all of this?\r\n\r\nWhat will YOU do to stop YOUR money from being used to fund the weapons and machinery used to kill Palestinians?\r\n\r\nHow can you, in any way, justify not doing ANYTHING within your power to put an end to this?\r\n\r\nLet me remind you again that we're already financing the weapons used in war crimes through our student fees. We're already guilty in our complacency. We're already guilty in our inaction, and we're twice as guilty if we sit around and let this bill fail. In our inaction we are supporting Israeli war crimes.\r\n\r\nActually, let me give it to you straight. Let me tell you exactly how I see it, through the complex arguments, flowery language, and emotional manipulation. Let me lay it out for you: Do you or do you not condone people dying? People being killed? Forget the term \"war crimes\" even. The reality of \"war crimes\" is that 711,000 Palestinians have died since 1948. In late 2008 and early 2009, over 1,400 Palestinians were killed during the Gaza War by weapons that we, as UC Berkeley students, have funded. Is this okay with you?\r\n\r\nI sure as hell know it's not okay with me.\r\n\r\nI understand that doing the right thing is rarely easy or popular. Challenging the status quo is always a messy business involving loud and persistent critics. Injustices exist because it's often easier to walk away than it is to challenge these critics.\r\n\r\nHowever, I urge you NOT to walk away. I plead with you NOT to be complacent. Be angry, be upset, be sad, be outraged, be scared, but whatever you do, don't be complacent. Don't let SB118A fail. You are guilty in your complacency. You are implicated in your complacency. In your complacency, there is blood on your hands and THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING. The whole world is watching, and in the words of Archibshop Desmond Tutu, \"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>What Can I Do?<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Write a letter to a senator explaining why you want him or her to support SB118A.

China once more is being blamed for everything going wrong in the U.S., from job losses to poisoned food and toys. Granted, some of the criticisms may be warranted \u2013 such as those on its spotty human rights track record and its notable lack of democracy. But the surge of politicians blaming China\u2019s supposed manipulation of its currency exchange rate for the U.S. recession is just downright sad. With all this China-bashing, it seems as if the yuan were the sole source of all the U.S.\u2019s economic problems! This egregious trend is not only misguided, it endangers the U.S.-China relationship, and furthermore, has the potential to create tension between Chinese Americans and the rest of the U.S. population. The rhetoric of China-bashing is omnipresent in the media, but is used particularly heavily by labor unions such as the AFL-CIO, who are ever anxious to invoke protectionist principles in order to decrease foreign competition, and by Democrats, who seek the electoral support of the labor unions. The accusations are coming from all levels of Washington. This March, President Obama urged China to adopt \u201ca more market-oriented exchange rate.\u201d Shortly afterward, 130 Congress members signed a letter to the Treasury demanding that unless China lets the yuan rise in value, the U.S. impose tariffs on Chinese goods \u2013 wonderful, let\u2019s start a trade war between the two largest economies in the world. Critics of China\u2019s current exchange rate policy claim that China is keeping the yuan undervalued in order to gain unfair advantages in international trade. A cheaper yuan makes Chinese goods less expensive in the United States and American goods more expensive in China. This apparently encourages Americans to indulge in cheap imports from China, critics say, making business more difficult for American producers. However, the situation is more complex than many critics make it seem. For one, the apparent loss to American producers is coupled with a gain for the millions of American consumers who prefer to pay less for their goods. I do not think that China has been pursuing an unfair currency policy. China follows a fixed exchange rate system, in which the value of the yuan is pegged to the dollar. There is nothing inherently wrong with this policy. Contrary to Obama\u2019s statement above, a recent *Wall Street Journal* article explained that \u201cthere is no free market in currencies, as there is in wheat or bananas. Currencies trade in global markets, but their supply is controlled by a cartel of central banks, which have a monopoly on money creation.\u201d[1] A fixed exchange rate system is in fact used in numerous other countries, including most of Europe. Why? In order to reap the benefits of stable exchange rates. This is what China is doing, and for over a decade it has been a boon to the world economy, leading to increased international trade, higher U.S. living standards due to availability of cheaper imported goods, and economic uplift for tens of millions of Chinese. Even the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development has supported China's control of the exchange rate, stating that China has \u201cdone more than any other emerging economy to stimulate domestic demand in order to mitigate the crisis.\u201d[2] It advised China not to give in to pressure from Western countries. This international stance certainly says something about the direction the U.S. is going with this currency-bashing. Stanford professor and renowned economic expert Ron McKinnon says that forcing China to appreciate the yuan is ultimately a misguided economic policy. He urges economists and politicians to \u201cdiscard the false theory that one can use changes in the exchange rate to control the net trade balance in a predictable way.\u201d[3] In fact, McKinnon says, the huge trade imbalance between the U.S. and China does not have anything to do with the exchange rate. Instead, it is largely caused by the discrepancy in investment and savings rates between the two economies. In the last decade, the real personal saving rate in the U.S. has been near zero, while that of China has been between 30 and 40 percent.[4] Perhaps the best way to begin fixing the trade deficit with China is by admitting that the U.S. has been living beyond its means for decades. Unless Americans change their investment and savings rates on an aggregate level, the trade deficit is not going to change. Another point to ponder is the fact that the savings China accumulates through trade with the U.S. are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. According to one of our own Congress reports, \u201cgiven its relatively low savings rate, the U.S. economy depends heavily on foreign capital inflows from countries with high savings rates (such as China) to help promote growth and to fund the federal budget deficit.\u201d[5] So when U.S. politicians complain about the undervalued yuan, their message to the Chinese essentially translates to: Stop lending us money. The U.S. anti-China sentiment resulting from China-bashing in the media does not bode well for the future of either nation. Both nations are inextricably intertwined in an international relationship of immense global significance. Moreover, clear changes in the power dynamics of this relationship have emerged in the 21st century. While China has depended greatly on the U.S. in the past, experts warn that this dependence on the U.S. is decreasing as China strengthens its ties with other nations. At the same time, the U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on China in multiple respects, including the foreign investments mentioned previously. Both nations must learn to adjust to this ongoing shift in the distribution of global power. China will need to exert caution in how it presents itself as a rising global superpower, avoiding policies that may be seen as a threat to global stability or hurt long-term national interests. Meanwhile, the United States must learn to display a more humble attitude toward China, instead of viewing it as an easy scapegoat to pile insults upon for the purpose of garnering votes at home. As Washington attempts to sift through its enormous budget deficits, it would behoove politicians to think carefully before creating an enemy out of one of the nation\u2019s biggest creditors. As a country, we need to strive for a mutually beneficial instead of an antagonistic relationship with China. Instead of viewing China as a rising enemy to be stifled, we need to view it as a valuable partner to cooperate with on solving imminent global issues. Yet that is not happening, as current media sentiment makes clear. Much as some would like to deny it, racial attitudes still lurk behind U.S. politics involving China and other Asian nations, and by extension, that involving Asian Americans. The concept of \u201cWestern is best\u201d is consistently reflected in American foreign policy as well as in the attitudes of much of the general American public. As Asian Americans, we have much at stake in a stable and positive U.S.-China relationship. Hostile national attitudes toward Asian nations often translate into racially motivated incidents of physical and intellectual violence against Asian Americans. This fact was brought to light most plainly in the infamous case of Vincent Chin, a Chinese American man beat to death in 1982 by Detroit auto-workers who thought he was Japanese and who were resentful of the job losses caused by the success of Japanese car manufacturers in America. In another illustrative case, during the Cold War the U.S. saw China as an idealogical enemy to be contained by all means. This resulted in the racialization of national security: Chinese Americans became suspected internal enemies and national security risks by virtue of their racial origin. These historical examples demonstrate the oft-underplayed but key role that race plays in linking U.S. diplomatic policies toward Asia with the treatment of Asian Americans domestically. So when when we have high-profile individuals like CNN commentator Jack Cafferty calling the Chinese a \u201cbunch of goons and thugs,\u201d[6] how detrimental is that to the image of Chinese Americans here at home? How much more absurd, ignorant, and racist can voices in public media get? It\u2019s a shame that U.S. politicians and the U.S. media are choosing to walk the path of China-bashing for the sake of carrying out their own political agendas. Not only is such propaganda a poison to American citizens\u2019 minds, it endangers our national relationship with an important rising country that we cannot afford to create an enemy out of, and it creates a leeway for domestic anti-Asian American sentiment \u2013 which we can very little afford either if we wish to retain our image as a progressive, respectable modern nation that practices what it preaches. > [1] The Yuan Scapegoat.

Both neighborhoods, home to yours truly, hold substantial significance for the Chinese American community. San Francisco's Chinatown is the oldest in America, established in the 1840s, while New York's is the largest, covering an area of about two miles. Though characterized by partially dilapidated buildings, buildings painted in bright colors with stereotypically \u201cAsian\u201d pagodas, and the smell of dim sum wafting from restaurants, the two communities share commonalities much deeper than their superficial media depictions. Their origins lie in the 1849 Gold Rush, which attracted the first huge wave of Chinese immigrants to California to try their luck sifting for gold. When the Gold Rush died down, these immigrants often had no financial means of returning home and were forced to permanently settle in the United States. Faced with increasingly discriminatory laws, such as outright exclusion and unjust taxes, some Chinese immigrants moved to the East Coast in search of employment. Chinatowns were created in this xenophobic atmosphere as protection against pervasive anti-Chinese sentiment, but soon expanded to meet other needs. In their isolated enclaves, Chinese immigrants developed social networks and self-sufficient businesses. With the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, Chinatowns across the country changed once again to encompass the increased flow of immigrants. Grassroots organizations such as Chinese Progressive Association (CPA), Chinatown Community Development Center (CCDC), and the Chinese Staff and Worker's Association (CSWA) developed youth advocacy, immigrant labor organizing, and tenant rights\u2019 programs with bilingual services. It is thus amusingly and painfully ironic that both cities' Chinatowns, initially formed due to their communities' isolation from mainstream society, are so threatened and exploited today by the ugly monster known as Gentrification. Euphemized as \"economic redevelopment\" or \"revitalization,\" this urban phenomenon refers to the takeover of low-income property by wealthier entities buying into the neighborhood and driving up prices. For example, the Ellis Act in San Francisco allows a landlord to evict his or her tenants on the premise of bankruptcy. Although the landlord is required to keep the property empty for at least five years after eviction, he or she is then able to sell it for a higher profit than the previous rent garnered. Consequently, the cost of living becomes unaffordable for the neighborhood's original residents, often resulting in the mass displacement of affected communities. Low-income communities and communities of color are especially vulnerable, particularly if their neighborhoods attract tourists. Gentrification has already wiped out Manilatown, a thriving Filipino community in San Francisco that died out in the early 1970s due to development in the financial district. Are Chinatowns headed down the same path? The officially recognized year of establishment for New York\u2019s Chinatown is 1870, when it emerged as a tiny Chinese ghetto in the middle of a highly diverse immigrant enclave. However, its post-1965 explosion into a nationally renowned landmark generated conditions that have pushed gentrification onto the community for decades. The simultaneous influx of Chinese low-income immigrant workers, professional businessmen, and overseas investors in the 1970s stimulated unprecedented growth in Chinatown's hundred-year history. Given its newly acquired immigrant labor force, the neighborhood developed an economy anchored on the restaurant and garment industries. However, Chinatown's garment industry has collapsed since the mid-1990s, as many garment factories closed due to increased competition from Chinese imports. This has thus put many Chinatown residents out of work, but has also led investors to engage in fervent real estate speculation in an effort to profit from the rising population of immigrants. The combination of fewer jobs and higher rent prices have rendered the neighborhood extremely unstable in recent years. Subsequently, the aftermath of September 11 catalyzed the urban colonialism of Chinatown in the name of \"economic redevelopment.\" Immediately after the attacks, city officials unhesitatingly tended to TriBeCa, Wall Street, and SoHo, affluent white neighborhoods near the World Trade Center; Chinatown, also a nearby community, was ignored until its residents protested. Moreover, officials also blocked off parts of Chinatown for weeks due to soot in the air, crippling local businesses. The city has proposed to ameliorate Chinatown's broken economy by pushing its overdevelopment and promoting the community's commodification. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, created to address these issues, has prioritized luxury development and augmented Chinatown's tourism industry. Policy measures such as the Rezoning Plan of Community District 3 have expedited Chinatown's destruction. Passed in 2008, the rezoning measure granted height protection to the gentrified East Village, allegedly to protect the historic neighborhood from overdevelopment. Proponents of the plan deliberately excluded Chinatown and the predominantly Latino Lower East Side, the other two constituent neighborhoods of CD3, promising to develop a \"separate plan\" for them. This plan is one of many similar plans passed during New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's tenure that have uprooted communities of color, but is especially detrimental due to Chinatown's unique post-9\/11 experience. The passage of the Rezoning Plan resulted in a hastened assault on Chinatown in the form of luxury construction, tenant harassment, and illegal evictions. The dispersal of the Chinatown community has exacerbated conditions for its small businesses. Corporations have attacked the area like vultures due to its convenient position amidst wealthy white neighborhoods and appeal to tourists and wealthy white patrons. Given developers' continuous gentrification of Chinatown into a historical and cultural treasure, it is unsurprising that New York has failed Chinatown, allowing it to disintegrate into a Disneyland version of itself and threatening to dissolve a beautiful community famed for its living history. On the other side of the country, San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown faces a different reality. Less a Disneyland and more a network of extended families, it is the second most densely populated neighborhood in the United States and home to an estimated 23,000 residents. While gentrification has not ravaged this Chinatown to the degree that it did in New York, the community still bears the costs of globalization and urban renewal. Rooted in the struggle for a self-efficient neighborhood during a period of violent hate crimes toward Chinese in the late 1800s, Chinatown sits on prime real estate. The wealthy neighborhoods of North Beach, the financial district, downtown, and Nob Hill border it, much like New York\u2019s Chinatown being surrounded by Wall Street and SoHo. In 1906, after the infamous earthquake that devastated the entire city and claimed at least 3,000 lives, Chinatown was under threat of relocation. City officials proposed exporting Chinatown to the city\u2019s southern outskirts, like the dispensable commodity popular opinion believed it to be. The suggested location rested on what is now Bayview\/Hunter\u2019s Point, an chemically hazardous area that used to be an old shipyard. Serving as a clear example of environmental racism, in which communities of color are deliberately subjected to environmentally toxic and unsafe conditions, this was a pre-cursor to the gentrification that later hit New York and transformed the lives of residents there. However, unlike New York, the residents of Chinatown in San Francisco pressured the city government to re-think their proposal by reminding them of the importance of tourism in their neighborhood. As the city\u2019s number one source of revenue, tourism was an industry officials could not afford to lose from their economy. In the end, Look Tin Eli, a Chinese American merchant, commissioned two Caucasian architects to design a new Chinatown in the likeness of a \u201clittle\u201d China, resplendent with bright colors and pagodas. Just one problem. The average building in China does not sport a roof with edges gently curling up to the sky. Nor are they decoratively painted with eye-catching shades of red, green, and yellow, traditional colors in the Chinese culture that symbolize luck and fortune. Look Tin Eli did what he had to do for the sake of preserving Chinatown, creating a landmark based on stereotypes and the imagination of two white men gone wrong. [1] Since its reconstruction in the early 1900s, Chinatown has continued to deal with pressure to redevelop properties into more profitable ventures. To combat this, community organizations lobbied for and successfully passed the 1986 Chinatown Area Plan. This plan set zoning heights to discourage corporate encroachment, restricted the commercial use of space to preserve Chinatown\u2019s function as a residential area as well as capital city, and emphasized the cultural and historical significance of this area. As Deland Chan, a senior planner at CCDC notes, the 1986 Area Plan \u201chas helped to prevent San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown from undergoing the same fate as New York\u2019s\u201d by effectively limiting spaces for corporate use. Another factor that distinctly sets the two Chinatowns apart is that the catastrophic events of 9\/11 and its economic consequences occurred in New York, and not San Francisco. New York\u2019s government pumped money into Lower Manhattan to revitalize the tourism industry there, while Chan states, \u201cTo put it simply, San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown never got that sort of attention.\u201d San Francisco was spared the gentrification that befell New York and its subsequent decline in affordable housing for tenants who had neither the financial means nor social capital to move elsewhere. But although San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown has kept up a fairly impressive stock of affordable housing, that does not mean its residents do not pay for living on such coveted land in other ways. A report by Sherman Gee, a youth educator in the Chinatown community, indicates that the \u201cthe hidden costs of keeping affordable housing in Chinatown has been a lack of repairs, dangerous living conditions, and the high incidence of housing violations.\u201d [2] Indeed, over 60 percent of housing consists of Single Room Occupancies (SROs), an eight by ten room legally defined as a rental unit that lacks a bathroom and a kitchen. SRO tenants must share communal bathroom and cooking areas, only to retreat to a living space cramped with belongings and other family members. These buildings have dim lighting, poorly maintained facilities, and landlords who are either apathetic to their tenants\u2019 needs or abroad and unable to deal with problems firsthand. New York and San Francisco\u2019s Chinatowns are home, yes, but it is a home where our neighbors are underprivileged and underserved, terms popularly used on campus to describe the struggle of the Asian Pacific American community. The very heterogeneity of the APA identity necessitates that all APA groups, not just Southeast Asians and refugees, take part in this struggle toward demanding better resources and political representation. Chinatowns have not escaped the colonialism affecting Asian countries abroad, but gentrification is not inevitable. Despite the push and pull factors of today\u2019s economy, gentrification is largely categorized by such projects as the Manhattan Development Corporation and can be effectively combated, as demonstrated by the 1986 Chinatown Area Plan. The challenge now is not only to preserve Chinatown as an historical and cultural relic but also as a community. > [1] http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=5337215 [2] http:\/\/bss.sfsu.edu\/urbanaction\/ua2007\/articlesPDF\/chinaTown.pdf\n\n\n","html":"<em>The Home Front Under Attack<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>denise wong<\/strong> and <strong>carmen ye<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPopularly conceived of as homogeneous homes to pigeons, cheap food, and commodified trinkets, the historically monumental Chinatowns of New York and San Francisco, while vastly different, have undergone similar struggles due to their complementary roots.\r\n\r\nBoth neighborhoods, home to yours truly, hold substantial significance for the Chinese American community. San Francisco's Chinatown is the oldest in America, established in the 1840s, while New York's is the largest, covering an area of about two miles.\r\n\r\nThough characterized by partially dilapidated buildings, buildings painted in bright colors with stereotypically \u201cAsian\u201d pagodas, and the smell of dim sum wafting from restaurants, the two communities share commonalities much deeper than their superficial media depictions. Their origins lie in the 1849 Gold Rush, which attracted the first huge wave of Chinese immigrants to California to try their luck sifting for gold. When the Gold Rush died down, these immigrants often had no financial means of returning home and were forced to permanently settle in the United States. Faced with increasingly discriminatory laws, such as outright exclusion and unjust taxes, some Chinese immigrants moved to the East Coast in search of employment.\r\n\r\nChinatowns were created in this xenophobic atmosphere as protection against pervasive anti-Chinese sentiment, but soon expanded to meet other needs. In their isolated enclaves, Chinese immigrants developed social networks and self-sufficient businesses. With the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, Chinatowns across the country changed once again to encompass the increased flow of immigrants. Grassroots organizations such as Chinese Progressive Association (CPA), Chinatown Community Development Center (CCDC), and the Chinese Staff and Worker's Association (CSWA) developed youth advocacy, immigrant labor organizing, and tenant rights\u2019 programs with bilingual services.\r\n\r\nIt is thus amusingly and painfully ironic that both cities' Chinatowns, initially formed due to their communities' isolation from mainstream society, are so threatened and exploited today by the ugly monster known as Gentrification. Euphemized as \"economic redevelopment\" or \"revitalization,\" this urban phenomenon refers to the takeover of low-income property by wealthier entities buying into the neighborhood and driving up prices. For example, the Ellis Act in San Francisco allows a landlord to evict his or her tenants on the premise of bankruptcy. Although the landlord is required to keep the property empty for at least five years after eviction, he or she is then able to sell it for a higher profit than the previous rent garnered.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the cost of living becomes unaffordable for the neighborhood's original residents, often resulting in the mass displacement of affected communities. Low-income communities and communities of color are especially vulnerable, particularly if their neighborhoods attract tourists. Gentrification has already wiped out Manilatown, a thriving Filipino community in San Francisco that died out in the early 1970s due to development in the financial district.\r\n\r\nAre Chinatowns headed down the same path?\r\n\r\nThe officially recognized year of establishment for New York\u2019s Chinatown is 1870, when it emerged as a tiny Chinese ghetto in the middle of a highly diverse immigrant enclave. However, its post-1965 explosion into a nationally renowned landmark generated conditions that have pushed gentrification onto the community for decades. The simultaneous influx of Chinese low-income immigrant workers, professional businessmen, and overseas investors in the 1970s stimulated unprecedented growth in Chinatown's hundred-year history.\r\n\r\nGiven its newly acquired immigrant labor force, the neighborhood developed an economy anchored on the restaurant and garment industries. However, Chinatown's garment industry has collapsed since the mid-1990s, as many garment factories closed due to increased competition from Chinese imports. This has thus put many Chinatown residents out of work, but has also led investors to engage in fervent real estate speculation in an effort to profit from the rising population of immigrants.

On March 13, 2010, 25 years after its inception, PASS celebrated its achievements throughout the years and looked ahead to what the future holds. The theme of PASS's 25th anniversary was \u201cLifted as One,\u201d highlighting the ability of the Pilipino community to extend an open hand to their members and achieve their goals together. This name is an extension of the phrase \u201cisang bagsak,\u201d which translates to \u201cone down, one fall.\u201d When one from the community falls, all fall with him. At a time when it\u2019s easy to take a student organization like PASS for granted, this celebration reminded the Pilipino community and beyond what a strong coalition of bright, confident students is capable of. PASS Executive Director Kaegy Pabulos put it best: \u201cFrom its conception, PASS actively endeavored to recruit and retain Pilipinos into higher education. Facing countless struggles in advancing through the intricacies of the educational system, PASS, with its communities, flourished and evolved. Today, without the motivated members that revitalize and foster the organization, PASS would not exist to celebrate its 25th year.\u201d I have been in and out of PASS for the past few years. I can\u2019t say that I know all the goals of this student organization, nor can I accurately describe how they are all executed. What I can do, however, is recount the ways in which I have witnessed PASS contribute to the advancement of Pilipinos in and around the UC Berkeley campus. I first encountered PASS in my senior year of high school. A student organization from Berkeley contacted me and a number of Pilipino students to participate in something called Senior Weekend, during which prospective Berkeley students of color spend a weekend in Berkeley and discover what it has to offer. PASS participates in this event along with other student organizations under the Bridges coalition, such as the Black Recruitment and Retention Center (BRRC), the Native American Recruitment and Retention Center (NARRC), the Raza Recruitment and Retention Center (RRRC), and the Asian\/Pacific Islander Recruitment and Retention Center (REACH!). During that weekend, high school seniors across California were exposed to a variety of political and resource workshops, as well as campus tours. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them the opportunity to see and experience Berkeley so they can see what is the right choice for them,\u201d said third year and 2007 Senior Weekend attendee, Precious Guan. \u201cWhat college to go to is one of the most important decision[s] a high school student has to make; Senior Weekend helps them make that decision.\u201d Many students have been positively impacted by Senior Weekend, not only in their decision to attend Cal, but also in getting involved with student organizations. Current PASS Executive Director Kaegy Pabulos was one of them. \u201cWhat made me want to get involved [in PASS] was the empowerment and inspiration it can provide to others,\u201d said Pabulos. PASS intern Arjunels Ducusin has experienced the type of empowerment Pabulos mentioned. \u201cMy first semester, I was struggling academically with the transition from high school to college,\u201d explained Ducusin, \u201cbut PASS showed me that that's normal and not only gave me the resources to fix that, but also gave me comfort and support when I felt like I didn't have any.\u201d PASS achieves its goals through three separate components of the organization: internal, retention and recruitment. The internal component works on the internal structure of the organization, including but not limited to finance, public relations, internal support and oversight. The recruitment component is in charge of reaching out to potential students, ranging from elementary to community college students, through events such as the aforementioned Senior Weekend. Finally, there\u2019s the retention committee, which fosters social, political, and academic awareness amongst individuals and the community as a whole. \u201cPASS's mission statement would forever be bigger than our roles as students,\u201d said Pabulos, \u201cThe organization plays a major role in attempting to challenge the educational system and the structures it imposes on students of color.\u201d And this is only scratching the surface. There is still so much more to learn about PASS and how to contribute to its mission. With just a year left in my college career, there seems to be very little time to do so. But this isn\u2019t the case. My commitment to PASS doesn\u2019t have to end when I receive my diploma, or when I leave the Berkeley campus to pursue a career. This is exactly what the 25th anniversary celebration showed. Cal alumni and past PASS participants reunited to illustrate the mission statement set down for this organization a couple of decades ago: to recruit and retain Pilipinos into higher education, and to keep an unbroken dialogue about issues that pertain to such. \u201cIn an effort to reconnect the lines that bound each of us to the overarching purpose of the organization, we hope that this occasion served as a testament to the colorful stories and experiences each of us have gone through,\u201d Pabulos said. \u201cPilipinos, alongside [other] communities of color, have faced inequities that were rarely acknowledged by the institutions around us. However, we unite and channel our energies to support and carry each other. With our collective voices, we are lifted as one!\u201d I may not constantly voice it, but PASS played a major role in my final decision to attend Cal. Senior Weekend allowed me to physically place myself on campus and was the final push for me to sign my SIR. This is why I give back. This is why many give back. There are students and kids out there in the same position as I was, and having PASS as a resource may just be the catalyst they need to reach for Berkeley, and more importantly, higher education. \u201cFor my part, seeing the inequalities happening in under-resourced schools, [such as] lack of resources and counselors telling students they do not deserve to be in a UC, motivates me to give these students a voice,\u201d stated Pabulos. \u201cThough there are times when programming can be stressful, knowing that we as community members can impact lives [of people from] children to college students makes the experience priceless.\u201d Which is why a mere month after celebrating its 25th year, PASS geared up for one of its most important yearly events: Senior Weekend. This year, PASS organized countless members of the Pilipino community from PASS, PAHC (Pilipino Association for Health Careers), and other PilOrgs around campus. These volunteers worked round the clock to ensure an exemplary experience for the high school seniors visiting Cal. \u201cEvery year we are able to put out these big programs like Senior\/Transfer Weekend through careful planning and mobilizing volunteers and interns,\u201d said PASS Youth Mentorship Coordinator Gil Navarro, \u201cThese programs can't be done unless we are able to motivate the community that we serve to give back and help out.\u201d That\u2019s what makes an organization like PASS, and the Pilipino community in general, so extraordinary. While each organization has its own separate mission statements, activities, and events, the community as a whole is able to marshal enough energy and drive to work towards the same goal and exemplify \u201cisang bagsak.\u201d Pabulos notes, \u201c\u2018Isang Bagsak\u2019 underlines our efforts to ensure that each student is given the opportunity and recognition to achieve higher education and succeed.\u201d \u201cPrograms such as Senior Weekend and Transfer Weekend directly tie into everything that all the other PilOrgs do,\u201d said Guan. \u201cThese transfers and freshmen are going to be the future members and leaders of the Pilipino community. It\u2019s only right that we invest in them.\u201d This year\u2019s Senior Weekend theme declares \u201ci AM the UNIVERSITY,\u201d reaffirming the sense of unity and cooperation the Bridges coalition hopes to symbolize. According to Navarro, each year\u2019s theme is open to the interpretation of attendees and volunteers alike. One interpretation of \u201ci AM the UNIVERSITY\u201d is to provide high school seniors with a sense of belonging and entitlement to a community, sharing both struggles and accomplishments. Navarro states, \u201cWhat I make of it is that students are claiming their stake here in UC Berkeley. Despite the economic crisis and all the budget cuts that have been happening, the essence of UC Berkeley is still the students.\u201d After 25 years of hard work and dedication, PASS is proud of its current members and past alumni's commitment, while future attendees demonstrate that PASS's continued efforts are both valuable and necessary. \u201cThe point of PASS is to meet the needs of the community and to [increase] the representation of Pilipinos in higher education,\u201d Ducusin said. \u201cHopefully, one day these goals will be met and then there would be no more need to have PASS.\u201d\n","html":"<em>25 years of building a community<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>cher padua<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe recruitment and retention of Pilipinos into higher education\u201d is the mission statement of UC Berkeley\u2019s Pilipino Academic Student Services (PASS).\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2010, 25 years after its inception, PASS celebrated its achievements throughout the years and looked ahead to what the future holds.\r\n\r\nThe theme of PASS's 25th anniversary was \u201cLifted as One,\u201d highlighting the ability of the Pilipino community to extend an open hand to their members and achieve their goals together.

But this isn\u2019t the case. My commitment to PASS doesn\u2019t have to end when I receive my diploma, or when I leave the Berkeley campus to pursue a career.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what the 25th anniversary celebration showed. Cal alumni and past PASS participants reunited to illustrate the mission statement set down for this organization a couple of decades ago: to recruit and retain Pilipinos into higher education, and to keep an unbroken dialogue about issues that pertain to such.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn an effort to reconnect the lines that bound each of us to the overarching purpose of the organization, we hope that this occasion served as a testament to the colorful stories and experiences each of us have gone through,\u201d Pabulos said. \u201cPilipinos, alongside [other] communities of color, have faced inequities that were rarely acknowledged by the institutions around us. However, we unite and channel our energies to support and carry each other. With our collective voices, we are lifted as one!\u201d\r\n\r\nI may not constantly voice it, but PASS played a major role in my final decision to attend Cal. Senior Weekend allowed me to physically place myself on campus and was the final push for me to sign my SIR. This is why I give back. This is why many give back. There are students and kids out there in the same position as I was, and having PASS as a resource may just be the catalyst they need to reach for Berkeley, and more importantly, higher education.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor my part, seeing the inequalities happening in under-resourced schools, [such as] lack of resources and counselors telling students they do not deserve to be in a UC, motivates me to give these students a voice,\u201d stated Pabulos. \u201cThough there are times when programming can be stressful, knowing that we as community members can impact lives [of people from] children to college students makes the experience priceless.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhich is why a mere month after celebrating its 25th year, PASS geared up for one of its most important yearly events: Senior Weekend. This year, PASS organized countless members of the Pilipino community from PASS, PAHC (Pilipino Association for Health Careers), and other PilOrgs around campus. These volunteers worked round the clock to ensure an exemplary experience for the high school seniors visiting Cal.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery year we are able to put out these big programs like Senior\/Transfer Weekend through careful planning and mobilizing volunteers and interns,\u201d said PASS Youth Mentorship Coordinator Gil Navarro, \u201cThese programs can't be done unless we are able to motivate the community that we serve to give back and help out.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what makes an organization like PASS, and the Pilipino community in general, so extraordinary. While each organization has its own separate mission statements, activities, and events, the community as a whole is able to marshal enough energy and drive to work towards the same goal and exemplify \u201cisang bagsak.\u201d\r\n\r\nPabulos notes, \u201c\u2018Isang Bagsak\u2019 underlines our efforts to ensure that each student is given the opportunity and recognition to achieve higher education and succeed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPrograms such as Senior Weekend and Transfer Weekend directly tie into everything that all the other PilOrgs do,\u201d said Guan. \u201cThese transfers and freshmen are going to be the future members and leaders of the Pilipino community. It\u2019s only right that we invest in them.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s Senior Weekend theme declares \u201ci AM the UNIVERSITY,\u201d reaffirming the sense of unity and cooperation the Bridges coalition hopes to symbolize. According to Navarro, each year\u2019s theme is open to the interpretation of attendees and volunteers alike. One interpretation of \u201ci AM the UNIVERSITY\u201d is to provide high school seniors with a sense of belonging and entitlement to a community, sharing both struggles and accomplishments.\r\n\r\nNavarro states, \u201cWhat I make of it is that students are claiming their stake here in UC Berkeley. Despite the economic crisis and all the budget cuts that have been happening, the essence of UC Berkeley is still the students.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter 25 years of hard work and dedication, PASS is proud of its current members and past alumni's commitment, while future attendees demonstrate that PASS's continued efforts are both valuable and necessary.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe point of PASS is to meet the needs of the community and to [increase] the representation of Pilipinos in higher education,\u201d Ducusin said. \u201cHopefully, one day these goals will be met and then there would be no more need to have PASS.\u201d","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":16,"created_at":"Wed, 19 May 2010 08:32:29 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 19 May 2010 08:32:29 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 19 May 2010 08:32:29 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":964,"title":"A New Twist on Hate","slug":"a-new-twist-on-hate","markdown":"\n*Years of hate drive a man to murder* by **alex tagawa** Most hate crimes we hear about are motivated by racial hate. One famous example is the Vincent Chin case. Although Chin was Chinese American, his murderers thought he was Japanese and targeted him because they resented Japan's success in the auto industry. However, rarely discussed are the crimes committed by people in reaction to some sort of discrimination they experienced in the past. Should people who commit such crimes be held completely responsible for their action, or can their past experiences of discrimination somewhat mitigate their responsibility? This is the question that will determine the case of Steven Ronald Honma. On March 20, 2010, Honma was charged for murdering Norman Schureman, an instructor at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. The murder occurred at a Persian New Year party in Westlake Village. During the party, Honma became upset after someone referred to his wife as a \u201cChristian white whore.\u201d[1] Honma left the party with his wife after the slur, but he later returned with a knife and two guns, and shot Schureman in an ensuing scuffle. Honma\u2019s attorney, Dmitry Gorin, claims that his client\u2019s actions are a corollary of years of racial harassment. Gorin stated that his \"client was \u2018scarred\u2019 by \u2018tremendous\u2019 discrimination during childhood as one of only a few Japanese-Americans in the San Fernando Valley at the time.\u201d Gorin also said, \u201cMr. Honma has never hurt anyone before in his life. Mr. Honma has been married for over 18 years and is respected, beloved by his friends and family.\u201d[2] Gorin considers Honma\u2019s actions a \u201ctextbook heat-of-passion incident,\u201d which means that they lacked the premeditated element of a crime, instead arising due to sudden anger or sadness.[3] Even if this is the case, it is important to investigate deeper into the causes of this incident rather than just looking at the surface. Honma committed murder over a racial and sexual slur, but most people do not murder over a single comment. Honma claims that years of discrimination and prejudice have \u201cscarred\u201d him. Perhaps this is true, and that comment was just the last straw for Honma to reach his breaking point. Victor Hwang, managing attorney of the Asian Law Caucus in San Francisco, argues that \u201cit is important for us to believe that the world is controlled by rationality. By assigning reasons to why bad things happen, we can learn from our experiences and change to avoid a reoccurrence.\u201d[4] Perhaps Honma was never able to rationalize why he was racially discriminated against, and therefore was unable to learn how to \u201cavoid a reoccurrence\u201d of discrimination, which led to a mental breakdown resulting in murder. It is important to remember that Honma did not murder Schureman because he hated Schureman; Honma murdered him over a single comment made by somebody else. Because Honma\u2019s defense is based on emotional and psychological arguments, it will be difficult to convince the court. There is no hard evidence that the jury and judge can see from the defense. It may even appear to the court that Honma\u2019s attorney is desperate to come up with ways to defend his client. Thus, there is a high potential that Honma\u2019s past experiences of discrimination will not be factored into the final decision. However, just because there is no hard evidence does not mean racial discrimination should be overlooked. Doing so would imply that ignorant comments like the one that brought about this murder are acceptable. Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a Harvard Medical School professor of psychiatry, suggests that racial violence by victims of discrimination occurs because people who are racially discriminated against are usually made to feel inferior, and that they often need to find someone to blame for their inferiority, which ultimately leads to \u201cparanoia and blaming others for your own failures.\u201d[5] Racial violence is not as simple as a \u201cheat-of-passion incident.\u201d It is something that is built up over years of abuse. As this case illustrates, lifelong racial discrimination really does affect the mentality of its victims. It is important for us to remember the power of words, and that what we say and do has the potential to affect people around us for the worse. Honma's case is an indication that today\u2019s society still needs to be educated on the potential of ignorant comments to affect \u2013 and even take away \u2013 people\u2019s lives. As a hardboiled reader, it is important to educate others around you that racial comments are a serious matter that should not be tolerated. > [1] Foxman, Adam. (2010, March 25).

This six-member dance crew of witty humor specializing in popping, choreography, and robotics \u2013 hence the name Po-reo-tics \u2013 started in Westminster, California in 2007. However, it was not until this year that they really shined on the radar screen, recently being crowned champions of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew,\u201d Season 5. Throughout the show, Poreotics made sure that they represented their name well, incorporating a fierce energy into their meticulous acts of popping and robotics and their creative choreography. I\u2019m not particularly an avid fan of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew,\u201d but I was happy to see a crew from somewhere close to home. If anything, they were reppin\u2019 Westminster! Holla to one of the epicenters of genuine Vietnamese cuisine and culture. During week one, Poreotics made their official debut into the competition by busting out isolations and offering their own twist to none other than the sickest track topping the hip hop charts: \u201cLove Story\u201d by Taylor Swift. After they did their thing on the dance floor, the host of the show, Mario Lopez, asked Poreotics member Can Nguyen why they decided to wear sunglasses in their performance. Nguyen responded in a mock accent, \u201cbecause we da Asian\u2026and we have da small eye\u2026and we like robots.\u201d In a previous interview, the crew had explained that the signature sunglasses made them look like robots. So, what Nguyen said was obviously a comical move \u2013 right? However, what might have not been obvious is just how much this self-depreciating comment costs to instigate a few laughs. The reaction from the audience was pretty much positive, but what about the reaction from the Asian American community and the implications on racial stereotypes? We get it that these guys are funny and extremely talented, but to resort to backing racial stereotypes as a means of entertaining the crowd is a bit unnecessary, to say the least. Personally, when watching dance competitions, race rarely crosses my mind. With all the slick action going on center stage, all I can think about is, how many hours did they need to perfect that? In particular, in a show like \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew\u201d that allows viewers to vote for their favorite teams, people generally look at skill level stemming from hard work as their main basis to root for a certain crew. But, when Poreotics brings up these racial stereotypes on national television and the host responds with \u201cyou guys really are funny,\u201d they are exploiting something offensive to create something laughable. Sometimes the best way to get over something is to laugh it off, but in this case, finding humor in racial stereotypes only exacerbates the problem and acknowledges the stereotypes as \u201ctruth.\u201d It creates the notion that it\u2019s okay to laugh at how certain races look, and suggests that the fact that they laugh at themselves too means they accept it. In week seven of the competition, Poreotics took on the Hip Hop Nation Challenge, which required them to combine various hip hop forms such as the New Orleans Bounce. That week, Poreotics announced that they had ABD: \u201cAsian Booty Disease\u201d \u2013 which meant that they did not have a fanny pack to dance with. Maybe this is just another one of Poreotics\u2019 funny moments, but it seems that the joke may be on us \u2013 the Asian community. Is this the way that we want to be represented? After Poreotics performed, judge JC Chasez said, \u201cyou guys did it right. It was funny to see you guys do that.\u201d But what is that supposed to mean? Chasez\u2019s statements sounded to me as if he were saying that Asians don\u2019t do that kind of dance because they can\u2019t, and that seeing them try was comical. This whole exchange demonstrates the feedback loop that I believe occurs in the perpetuation of racial stereotypes. Poreotics makes a joke of themselves as Asians and the audiences takes that joke and runs with it. I suppose it\u2019s nice that this is a performance environment where appearances don\u2019t really matter as long as you can prove yourself on stage. But in the \u201creal world,\u201d these stereotypes are the barriers that prevent many individuals from being able to take the stage and prove themselves. By taking moments like this lightly, we continue to enforce the stereotypes that plague our community. Just earlier this month, numerous instances of what seem to be random acts of violence occurred in San Francisco in a series of attacks on the Muni. In a recent incident, a surveillance video captured a group of individuals terrorizing a rider along the Third Street Muni line. The attackers were teenage boys and the victim was a 57-year-old Asian woman. The most devastating incident occurred last January, when 83-year-old Huan Chen was kicked and beaten as he left the Muni stop at Third and Oakdale and later died from his injuries. In all of these incidents, the assailants were African American teenagers and the victims were Asian. Although we may never hear from the attackers exactly why they carried out these crimes, we can deduce that some form of hate was involved. Since these attacks were committed by teenagers, it is disturbing to ponder who and what may have planted ideas of hate in their minds. Media is very influential nowadays, and it is crucial to keep in mind how we want to portray ourselves to others, especially on shows that target teenagers such as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew.\u201d By making such racially stereotypical remarks, Poreotics propagates the same ideas that community leaders have tried to eradicate. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew\u201d\u2019s track record of winners has shown that Asian Americans definitely are in these dance competitions to win them. Actually, all of the crews except one that have won the competition were comprised of Asian members. For this reason, starting with the next season, the show has banned all groups completely composed of Asian members from the competition and limited the crews to having a maximum of two Asian dancers. Producer Randy Jackson explained, \u201cwe think it\u2019s only right to give other races a fighting chance within the show.\u201d Just kidding. That didn\u2019t happen. But this was an actual rumor that circulated the Internet. What is interesting is that many people actually believed or were hesitant to call it out as false when they first heard it. This suggests that the winning streak of Asian dance crews did not pass unnoticed. However, these champions were not notorious \u2013 if anything, they demonstrated that barriers could be broken when people reach a common ground with their passions and respect others on substantial grounds such as talent. But it is clear from the acceptance of this rumor that racial diversity is not celebrated, but rather, viewed as a competitive threat. Dancing has always been a powerful means of self-expression. Watching these groups perform on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew\u201d has always gotten my blood pumping faster and has even been slightly inspiring. After watching these performances, I am usually at awe because every move seems perfected and I feel that there is nothing I would change if I were a member of one of the teams. However, after hearing the comments made by Poreotics, there are a couple of things I would change. Poreotics had the chance to represent themselves and the Asian American community, but they degraded themselves and chose to find humor in racial stereotypes when they could have propelled a more positive and empowering view on Asian Americans and racial diversity in general. As a member of the Asian American community, I would like to think that we, too, are a crew\u2026 that we are a team. So, I felt disappointed and actually offended to hear such stereotypical remarks made by people who were representing the very subjects of those remarks. It may just have been the entertainer side trying to humor the crowd, but it was a move on the dance floor made for all the wrong reasons.\n","html":"<em>ABDC\u2019s Season 5 winner Poreotics not exactly reppin\u2019 it legitly in the spotlight <\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>crystal sitt<\/strong>\r\n\r\nPoreotics.

But in the \u201creal world,\u201d these stereotypes are the barriers that prevent many individuals from being able to take the stage and prove themselves. By taking moments like this lightly, we continue to enforce the stereotypes that plague our community.\r\n\r\nJust earlier this month, numerous instances of what seem to be random acts of violence occurred in San Francisco in a series of attacks on the Muni. In a recent incident, a surveillance video captured a group of individuals terrorizing a rider along the Third Street Muni line. The attackers were teenage boys and the victim was a 57-year-old Asian woman. The most devastating incident occurred last January, when 83-year-old Huan Chen was kicked and beaten as he left the Muni stop at Third and Oakdale and later died from his injuries. In all of these incidents, the assailants were African American teenagers and the victims were Asian.\r\n\r\nAlthough we may never hear from the attackers exactly why they carried out these crimes, we can deduce that some form of hate was involved. Since these attacks were committed by teenagers, it is disturbing to ponder who and what may have planted ideas of hate in their minds. Media is very influential nowadays, and it is crucial to keep in mind how we want to portray ourselves to others, especially on shows that target teenagers such as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew.\u201d By making such racially stereotypical remarks, Poreotics propagates the same ideas that community leaders have tried to eradicate.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew\u201d\u2019s track record of winners has shown that Asian Americans definitely are in these dance competitions to win them. Actually, all of the crews except one that have won the competition were comprised of Asian members.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, starting with the next season, the show has banned all groups completely composed of Asian members from the competition and limited the crews to having a maximum of two Asian dancers. Producer Randy Jackson explained, \u201cwe think it\u2019s only right to give other races a fighting chance within the show.\u201d\r\n\r\nJust kidding. That didn\u2019t happen. But this was an actual rumor that circulated the Internet. What is interesting is that many people actually believed or were hesitant to call it out as false when they first heard it. This suggests that the winning streak of Asian dance crews did not pass unnoticed. However, these champions were not notorious \u2013 if anything, they demonstrated that barriers could be broken when people reach a common ground with their passions and respect others on substantial grounds such as talent.\r\n\r\nBut it is clear from the acceptance of this rumor that racial diversity is not celebrated, but rather, viewed as a competitive threat.\r\n\r\nDancing has always been a powerful means of self-expression. Watching these groups perform on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Dance Crew\u201d has always gotten my blood pumping faster and has even been slightly inspiring. After watching these performances, I am usually at awe because every move seems perfected and I feel that there is nothing I would change if I were a member of one of the teams.\r\n\r\nHowever, after hearing the comments made by Poreotics, there are a couple of things I would change. Poreotics had the chance to represent themselves and the Asian American community, but they degraded themselves and chose to find humor in racial stereotypes when they could have propelled a more positive and empowering view on Asian Americans and racial diversity in general.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Asian American community, I would like to think that we, too, are a crew\u2026 that we are a team. So, I felt disappointed and actually offended to hear such stereotypical remarks made by people who were representing the very subjects of those remarks. It may just have been the entertainer side trying to humor the crowd, but it was a move on the dance floor made for all the wrong reasons.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":16,"created_at":"Wed, 19 May 2010 08:36:50 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 19 May 2010 08:36:50 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 19 May 2010 08:36:50 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":969,"title":"Majors Clash","slug":"majors-clash","markdown":"\nby **sunny kim** \u201cHi. My name is Sunny, and I\u2019m double majoring in Asian American Studies and Business.\u201d As soon as I introduce myself, I can feel the judgments people are making. At Haas, business students usually ask a follow-up question, curious as to how my other major will be of any use in the future. In ethnic studies spaces, people assume that I am aiming to land a corporate job, making bank right out of college. I used to feel like I did not fit the image of an \u201cideal\u201d member of either community. I felt like I did not have enough knowledge or insight to contribute to my ethnic studies space, and I was especially afraid of being criticized for not being politically correct or showing any signs of conservatism. Within my business space, I never felt an immense desire to pursue consulting or investment banking like most of my peers did. However, after a while I began to view the intersection of my two very different majors from a new angle. I no longer viewed myself as not fitting in, but rather, as the connection between two spaces that rarely interact. For example, very few people at Haas witnessed the March 4th strikes or the Blackout on Sproul. And if they witnessed it, they were confused as two why those events were happening. Some have made ignorant and insensitive comments as a result, but I found it difficult to blame them. I know it appears unfair that the business school is able to provide so many free things that I do not even take advantage of while other departments are always in fear of cuts. However, in exchange for these privileges, Haas creates an environment which deters students from engaging in student activism. Business courses are structured in a way that teaches students to accept the knowledge that is presented to them without challenging it. In essence, this overall mentality keeps students from being politicized and aware. There was never a discussion or announcement in any of my classes about the walkout strikes at all, and it doesn\u2019t help that Haas is on the edge of campus, isolated from Sproul. Furthermore, Haas professors sent out emails discouraging students from participating in the strike on March 4th. The message was that these strikes could jeopardize our academic future and that this crisis did not concern Haas students. The tragedy is that this crisis concerned Haas students even more than most others because of the proposed differential fee that would raise tuition by an additional $1,000 for those enrolled in the Haas program. On the other hand, Ethnic Studies is structured and functions in a completely different way. The courses teach students to be critical of the information they receive and engage in dialogue. Students learn to critique the actions of the school administration, and in the process, become politicized through student activism. As a member of this community, I was informed of when, where, why, and how the Blackout and March 4th were happening through classroom announcements and emails sent by students who were involved in organizing the two events. In addition, I was also able to gain a deeper insight by participating in dialogues that discussed the events inside and outside the classroom. However, I am often disappointed to find that the opportunity to actively participate in ethnic studies discussions is only available to those who have adopted ethnic studies vocabulary. Throwing around terms such as \u201cprivilege\u201d and \u201csocial constructs\u201d can be intimidating and people outside that circle, such as business majors, may feel uninvited to participate. As part of a community that is fighting to be included, I find it hypocritical that there is an invisible rule that allows people to contribute only the knowledge that will earn snaps while holding back from making controversial statements. This not only goes against the principle of inclusivity but also inhibits the growth of knowledge. Just as we are critical of society, Ethnic Studies majors need to be critical of their own behavior. Although the difference between the two majors creates a gap between the two respective communities of students, these communities can be bridged. I can speak from personal experience. I am pleasantly surprised that when I try to educate my Haas peers on why these events are happening and why Ethnic Studies is valuable, they listen and show a willingness to learn more. Ignorance exists, but there is also hope to eliminate ignorance through education. Given the ongoing campus-wide financial and political turmoil, now is especially a crucial time to break down the walls between the two fields and to collaborate across spaces in order to further advance our struggles within higher education.\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>sunny kim<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\u201cHi.

The Hmong people are not only small in numbers, with about 188,000 Hmong in the United States according to the U.S. 2005 Census, but also lacking in public representation. So for those that don\u2019t know, the Hmong are an ethnic group who traditionally live in the highland regions of Southeast Asian countries such as Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. Because there are no written records of early Hmong history, it is difficult to trace the origins of the Hmong people. However, Southeast Asian linguistics expert Martha Ratliff states that there is \u201clinguistic evidence to suggest that [the Hmong] have occupied the same areas of southern China for at least the past 2,000 years.\u201d[1] At the close of the 17th century, many Hmong migrated southwards, primarily towards Laos, to seek richer soil for farming and political liberation from the Chinese government. In the early 1960s, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s Special Activities Division recruited and trained indigenous Hmong people in Laos for the purpose of fighting in the Vietnam War. The men, or rather boys, that were recruited ranged from 15 to 25 years of age. This group was what the U.S. so creatively called the \u201cSpecial Guerilla Unit\u201d because of their competence in fighting using guerilla tactics. With the Hmong population at the time just shy of 400,000, over 100,000 Hmong people died as a result of the war.[2] It wasn\u2019t until May 15, 1997 that the U.S. officially acknowledged its involvement in the Secret War by designating the Laos Memorial, located in Arlington National Cemetery, to recognize Laotian Hmong veterans. While the Vietnam War officially started in 1961, another war that occurred during the time was the so-called Secret War. This was a civil war that took place in Laos from 1953 to 1975 between the Communist Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Government. Both sides were heavily endorsed by world superpowers at the time. The Royal Lao Government was supported by none other than the United States. When the Pathet Lao finally won the war, however, the Hmong were seen as a threat and have been persecuted in Laos ever since. As a direct result of the ethnic turmoil initiated during the Vietnam War and the Secret War in Laos, Thailand has become an asylum country, hosting thousands of Hmong as internal refugees awaiting relocation to a safer country. Surviving Hmong people who did not seek refuge in places such as Thailand or other asylum countries remain scattered throughout the jungles of Laos. Though it is hard to tell due to the lack of the Hmong population\u2019s visibility, it is estimated that the Hmong currently make up about 10 percent of the population in Laos and one percent of the population in Thailand.[3] Now, enough with the history chat. Let\u2019s get real. Just recently in December of 2009, Thailand forcibly repatriated over 4,500 Hmong back to Laos. Repatriation, which in this case describes the forceful return of Hmong refugees back to the homeland they fled from, is a violation of humanitarian principles laid down by the United Nations, the U.S. State department, and human rights groups. Thailand\u2019s plan for repatriating the Hmong involved a deal with Laos. It is important to note that Laos has not allowed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to monitor the repatriation of the Hmong \u2013 reasons as to why (since this would be Laos\u2019 chance to demonstrate its policy of humanitarian treatment) remain open to interpretation. The U.S. State Department reported in late December of 2009 that many of the Hmong were in need of protection and that returning to Laos would \u201cimperil the well-being of many individuals.\u201d[4] This is to say that the Laotian government would continue its retaliation against the Hmong, specifically Hmong veterans affiliated with the Vietnam War and Secret War, who are called \u201ctraitors\u201d by the government. Additionally, by forcing repatriation of the Hmong, Thailand broke the international principle known as non-refoulement, which protects refugees from being forcibly expelled by asylum countries. Hmong refugees, who had thought they were \u201csafe\u201d from harm under the \u201cprotection\u201d of the UNHCR and \u201calliance\u201d with the U.S., suddenly found themselves falling into a pit of quicksand with no one and nothing to hold on to. Despite knowledge of this information (or even more information than this), the UNHCR and the U.S. State Department released pathetic statements such as, \"Although [we have] no formal presence in Laos, [we] hope to get access to the returned Hmong.\"[5] Why is it that when there is a tragedy in Asia, such as the Hmong genocide or the Cambodian genocide, it is seldom largely covered, if covered at all, in the U.S. media? Come on! Wake up! While I respect the gathered support for crises such as Haiti, can\u2019t we also deal with the problems we started elsewhere around the world?! A Hmong genocide is currently taking place because of the Laotian government\u2019s search for retaliation. This issue has been incubating for over thirty years, and there still has not been any positive change. This is far from being over. This is an ongoing fight. I am here. You are here. You are probably asking: Why should I care about some unknown group of people? My answer is this: because this issue is bigger than just the Hmong people. This issue of oppression, suppression, and the application of ignorance has plagued and is plaguing many other ethnic groups out there \u2013 big or small, known or not. The fact is we are all here. So let\u2019s stand in solidarity. Let us demonstrate the power of grassroots movements and the boomerang model theory at its best. Tell friends, loved ones, and neighbors about the issues that so many people face around the world but that no one speaks of. Why shouldn\u2019t we take advantage of our ability to rally support against the repatriation of the Hmong, not to mention the deaths, injuries, and emotional traumas that are resulting from it? Sites such as Facebook Cause or Chase Community Giving are just a few of the many networks that we can utilize to draw attention to and empower change on this problem. This issue may not be the \u201ctop story\u201d in the media, but that definitely doesn\u2019t make it any less important. This issue is more than just an \u201cissue.\u201d We are talking lives here \u2013 mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters that are possibly dying. We need to sit the U.S. down like a bad child and interrogate the shit out of them. This is a salient problem that we need to hold the U.S. accountable for. We can take the first step by being proactive and exerting pressure on the political system through spreading grassroots awareness to our local Congressmen and government officials. An organization that is currently tackling this issue is the Hmong International Human Rights Watch (HIHRW), along with a few non-governmental organizations that are allied with the HIHRW such as the Relief Logistics International (www.rlingo.org), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (http:\/\/www.msf.org), and International Rescue Committee (http:\/\/www.theirc.org).

People often have a hard time understanding the value of Asian American Studies. I\u2019ve encountered people who have gone so far as to say that the entire discipline of social sciences has no value whatsoever, and that the math and sciences are somehow inherently more valuable. I seriously want to smack these people upside the head when they tell me this. I just want to write them off as ignorant and never speak to them again. But then I remind myself that doing this would be counterproductive. Just writing someone off as ignorant does not change the fact that there are so many others out there with the same mindset. So I have two choices: I can try to share my perspective and hope that they will listen, or I can walk away. Fight or flight. I choose to fight. Because the social sciences are essential to the world in which we live. Asian American Studies challenges students to think critically about society. Why is it that U.S.-born Chinese and Filipina women under age 55 have higher rates of cancer than white women of the same age group?[1] This isn\u2019t just a statistic. This is just one example of the kinds of issues that Asian American Studies investigates \u2013 issues that affect you, me, and our communities. Contrary to popular belief, social science is not just about writing bullshit papers. It is about addressing issues that plague our country. It is about advocating for our communities. It is about social justice. The social sciences critically examine why people behave and think the way they do. We question and analyze existing paradigms because we can\u2019t change them without studying them. Now, the jaded and cynical student would argue that social justice, just like the social sciences, is bullshit as well. Many believe that it\u2019s just human nature to be selfish and tyrannical; even if we tried to advocate for change and social justice, human nature would win out. I find this sort of cynical attitude to be part of a vicious cycle of apathy. Apathy (and perhaps ignorance) is at the root of a lot of issues in this country. People use their cynicism as an excuse for not acting, and therefore nothing changes. We need to break out of this vicious cycle. I realize that realistically we as individuals cannot transform the world into sunshine and puppies. It's too much for any one person to tackle every pressing issue out there. So we often have to choose the issues that matter the most to us. Advocating for change is hard work. There are some days when I would like to just throw in the towel and join the ranks of the apathetic. But I choose not to. Because choosing not to act is choosing to condone injustice, which I personally cannot accept. This is why I study Asian American Studies. People may think Asian American Studies majors are na\u00efve for wanting to make a difference in their communities. I would say that this drive for change is better than sitting on our apathetic asses and doing nothing. There is nothing wrong with being idealistic. Even if we don\u2019t necessarily reach those ideals, we at least have something to strive for. It\u2019s better than settling for a system that we know is flawed and broken. Change is often intangible. It isn\u2019t always a vaccine that eliminates AIDS. It may be difficult to see the progress that emerges from Asian American Studies because it often is not a tangible product. However, that does not mean the progress does not exist. The passage of the 1965 Immigration Act is an example of past social progress. This act eliminated the National Origins quotas, which had limited immigration from Asia to token levels. The 1965 Immigration Act was a watershed in Asian American history because it allowed, for the first time in American history, waves of immigration from Asia into the U.S. Although policy makers at the time did not intend for the act to benefit Asian immigration, it is an example of the amount of power that policy makers have. This is why we need socially conscious policy makers in office whom we can trust to advocate for social progress. In my conversations with non-social sciences majors, I\u2019ve often encountered the questions, \u201cWell, what can you even do with a B.A. in Asian American Studies? Can you even make money with that?\u201d I\u2019d like to point out that what you major in will not necessarily become your chosen career. Mike Judge graduated from UCSD with a B.S. in physics. Did he become a physicist? No. He ended up creating one of America\u2019s beloved cartoon series, \u201cKing of the Hill.\u201d He followed his passion and was innovative enough to create a career from it. Law, education, non-profit work, journalism, politics, social work\u2026 Asian American Studies majors have the chance to do something worthwhile. For example, Jane Kim is the President of the Board of Education and a civil rights attorney in the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area. As an undergraduate, she double majored in Asian American Studies and Political Science at Stanford. Kim is an example of someone who followed her passion and used her Asian American Studies major to advocate for the API community in San Francisco. As director of the Chinatown Community Development Center, she developed the Adopt-an-Alleyway program, which was responsible for cleaning up the alleyways in Chinatown that the city government neglected. I have also encountered the argument that math and science majors have a heavier workload, and therefore these disciplines are more valuable. There is an inaccurate perception that social science majors have it easier because all we do is read and write. I\u2019m not going to argue that one discipline is easier or harder than another. This is a moot point because engaging in that debate is counterproductive. I don\u2019t see why we have to organize the disciplines in a hierarchy. Each discipline has its own unique value. Unfortunately, this attitude isn\u2019t reflected in this university. Just last year, the University proposed drastic cuts to the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures. The proposed cuts would have reduced Japanese language courses by 40 percent, Chinese courses by 54 percent, and Korean courses by 66 percent.[2] In this time of budget cuts, we have to ask ourselves, why are the humanities and social sciences always the first courses to be cut? What does this say about our society? American culture has the tendency to value the math and sciences over the social sciences. We\u2019re taught as a society that math and science are more useful because they produce tangible products that we can see and touch. Part of growing up, however, is learning to think critically about what we\u2019ve been taught. Berkeley has had a rich history of activism leading to social change. And social change starts with critical thinking and questioning, which the social sciences facilitate. The hard sciences can only fix certain aspects of the issues plaguing our society. What we need now is for individuals and society to validate the social sciences. We need social progress as much as we need scientific progress. We can produce all the AIDS vaccines that we want, but if the communities that need these solutions the most such as the API community are not receiving the benefits, then what is the point of all this scientific progress? If certain communities are not benefitting from science due to unfair policies, then we are not truly making progress. The hard sciences go hand-in-hand with the social sciences. These disciplines are most effective when applied together. Berkeley offers over 300 undergraduate and graduate programs. We need to embrace the diversity and wealth of knowledge in this university and work across disciplines in order to find solutions to not only issues that affect our university, but also issues that we will encounter in the outside world once we graduate. > [1] Allday, E.

President Obama\u2019s proposed federal budget will cut or eliminate 121 federal programs[1]. This includes spending on education, despite the present need for intellectual resources in the workforce. According to the New York Times, a recent government poll showed that thousands of public schools have stopped teaching foreign languages in the last decade. While this may be monetarily beneficial in the present economic state, it will constrain America's future economic and political development. Language barriers may impede the U.S.\u2019s capability to establish strong global business and diplomatic relations in years to come. In short, multilingualism and opportunity go hand in hand. Others beside Washington have recognized the importance of language learning, however, and this has led to alternative sources of funding for language education. For instance, in a national trend that policy makers seem to have overlooked, the Chinese language is currently receiving increased attention from public and private funders of education. The emergence of this trend coincides with the increased economic development of China; according to the World Economic Outlook Database, China\u2019s GDP increased by roughly 325% from 2000 to 2006 alone. The Chinese government has been one large contributor to the trend. With help from the Chinese government, more U.S. primary and secondary schools have been able to offer Chinese in the past couple of years. The Chinese Language Ministry has been sending teachers from China to schools all over the world. Because the Chinese government is paying a portion of their salaries, this puts less financial stress on school districts. This also allows the U.S. and China to engage in cultural exchange by providing teachers and students unique learning opportunities. Educational television has also been picking up on this trend. Television is certainly an instrumental and influential venue that can serve as another alternative medium to promote language learning and cultural exchange. For example, Nickelodeon has an animated series named \u201cNi Hao, Kai-Lan,\u201d which introduces elements of Chinese language and culture to its viewers. Prior to that, from 2001 to 2002 PBS Kids aired a series called \u201cSagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat\u201d based on a children's book by Amy Tan. This program familiarized the audience with Chinese cultural values such as collectivism and filial obligation. Moreover, PBS is publicly funded by viewers, suggesting a general consensus on the importance of language learning. Despite the national cuts to educational funding, the increase of interest in Chinese has been reflected in school curriculae as well. Currently, the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington estimates that of the American middle and high schools offering a foreign language, the proportion offering Chinese is up to 4 percent from 1 percent since three years ago. Including Chinese in foreign language curriculum not only mirrors the global economic trends, it provides a space for children to continue to develop skills learned from early educational television programs. It is extremely interesting that the fastest growth in number of schools offering Chinese is occurring in states like Ohio, Georgia, and Utah. The demographics of these regions, primarily Caucasian, contrast with that of Chinese heritage communities, which are primarily located on the East and West coasts. As we can see, even individuals with no Chinese ancestry are interested in learning the language \u2013 and for a good reason, as doing so will surely open up potential opportunities in the next ten years. A similar trend in growth of interest in Japanese language and culture occurred in the 1980s when Japan emerged as an economic powerhouse in the automobile and technological industries. However, after the economic growth slowed down, the initial interest in Japanese language and culture quickly declined. Unlike Japan\u2019s case though, certain Chinese industries that have penetrated the global market face little competition. These include industries in precious metals such as gold that cannot be substituted or replicated. Therefore, America\u2019s interest in the Chinese language may prove to be longer-lived than that it held in Japanese. In fact, AP Chinese was introduced three years ago, and according to College Board it has now surpassed AP German as the third most tested AP language. Offering an AP Chinese test not only encourages students to learn Chinese continually throughout high school, it also serves as an extra incentive for individuals seeking college credit. It would be a shame to have learned a language starting from preschool years only to have to stop in college because that language was not offered. College is supposed to provide richer learning opportunities and expand on individuals\u2019 interests \u2013 including interests in language. This is especially important because language is best retained through constant exposure. Learning language not only gives insight into cultural backgrounds but also fosters a greater appreciation for diversity. Although the government is no longer a sufficient source for educational funding, Chinese language programs are now supported by private and public sources, as we can see through the above examples. This offers hope to our own educational crisis with the recent cuts to the East Asian Language and Culture Program (EALC). Given the world\u2019s increasing globalization, the inherent benefit of learning foreign languages is apparent. Knowing this, I predict that if the University continues to not support EALC, someone else will. Aside from global economic ties, international cooperation is required in efforts towards world issues. An example of one pressing global issue is energy conservation. As each year passes, the global population increases but available resources decrease. Given the scope of the environmental and energy issues, they cannot be solved by having everyone in the United States switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs. While there isn\u2019t any quick or easy method to approach this issue, one inevitable way to begin is to foster linguistic and cultural understanding with other countries and work together towards a global solution. And the first step in this process may just be learning to say \u201cNi hao.\u201d > [1] Goldwein, Marc. (2007, May 9). Obama Announces Proposed Cuts to Federal Budget. *The Washington Post*.

America!","slug":"happy-birthday-america","markdown":"\n*by joanna kwong* In America, I am still an outsider. My exterior gives me away\u2014the black hair, the olive skin, the almond-shaped eyes. Though I was born here and act American a girl as any, I am only what I appear. But for years, I claimed\u2014clung to, even\u2014my American identity. I didn\u2019t want to be the girl, 5\u20194\u2033 with the thick, toneless American accent, the one relatives called gwai lo (\u9b3c\u4f6c)\u2014ghost person, white. I didn\u2019t want to be the lost cause, the girl too American, a walking symbolic gesture of the Chinese culture that was to be lost with my generation. I couldn\u2019t handle that burden. I remembered all too well that, in my sixth grade year, I bunked with three Chinese girls for science camp in the Santa Cruz mountains. We ate spaghetti in the mess hall, and while brushing our teeth and peering into the bathroom mirror to check our complexion, I confessed that I had never once used chopsticks; the fork was my tool of choice. Through the mirror, I saw their faces contort and I witnessed my own alienation. \u201cHow can you be so white-washed?\u201d said one girl with braided pigtails and wire-framed glasses. Later that year, my mom handed me a book, with a missing cover and pages bound together by a single strip of yellow masking tape: a Cantonese how-to book in blocky serif. For weeks, I pored over characters, repeated phrases in my room, said I would be Chinese, wished so hard I once yelled at parents over dinner, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you teach me?\u201d Faces blank, they stared across the dinner table, before speaking softly, \u201cBut then you wouldn\u2019t know English so well.\u201d I folded my arms, and sunk into my seat. Somehow, I got to thinking that if I couldn\u2019t be Asian, I could be American. I could be what I had always been\u2014the girl in jeans and a tshirt, listening to rock music, dreaming of someday being a songwriter or an author. I thought these things, but when I was 21 and in Nevada, seven white boys looking no older than 12 biked by and yelled, \u201cAsian domination! Go back to your own country!\u201d There were folks around\u2014all white, all older\u2014but no one looked, didn\u2019t even say a thing. I\u2019ve never even been across the Pacific Ocean. Still, there were other reminders indicating that I did not conform to the traditional expectations of America\u2014in magazine racks at the supermarket or while window-shopping in the City. A flip through a beauty magazine usually meant more years spent toying with makeup, uninstructed. Shopping at large retailers only meant needing to special order my petite-sized jeans. I once knew a girl who went card shopping for Father\u2019s Day, looking specifically for a card featuring an Asian father.

[God Bless the USA](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-ydjcIOEV_I&feature=player_embedded)\n","html":"<em>by joanna kwong<\/em>\r\n\r\nIn America, I am still an outsider. My exterior gives me away\u2014the black hair, the olive skin, the almond-shaped eyes. Though I was born here and act American a girl as any, I am only what I appear.\r\n\r\nBut for years, I claimed\u2014clung to, even\u2014my American identity. I didn\u2019t want to be the girl, 5\u20194\u2033 with the thick, toneless American accent, the one relatives called gwai lo (\u9b3c\u4f6c)\u2014ghost person, white. I didn\u2019t want to be the lost cause, the girl too American, a walking symbolic gesture of the Chinese culture that was to be lost with my generation.\r\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t handle that burden.\r\n\r\nI remembered all too well that, in my sixth grade year, I bunked with three Chinese girls for science camp in the Santa Cruz mountains. We ate spaghetti in the mess hall, and while brushing our teeth and peering into the bathroom mirror to check our complexion, I confessed that I had never once used chopsticks; the fork was my tool of choice. Through the mirror, I saw their faces contort and I witnessed my own alienation. \u201cHow can you be so white-washed?\u201d said one girl with braided pigtails and wire-framed glasses.\r\n\r\nLater that year, my mom handed me a book, with a missing cover and pages bound together by a single strip of yellow masking tape: a Cantonese how-to book in blocky serif. For weeks, I pored over characters, repeated phrases in my room, said I would be Chinese, wished so hard I once yelled at parents over dinner, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you teach me?\u201d Faces blank, they stared across the dinner table, before speaking softly, \u201cBut then you wouldn\u2019t know English so well.\u201d I folded my arms, and sunk into my seat.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I got to thinking that if I couldn\u2019t be Asian, I could be American. I could be what I had always been\u2014the girl in jeans and a tshirt, listening to rock music, dreaming of someday being a songwriter or an author.\r\n\r\nI thought these things, but when I was 21 and in Nevada, seven white boys looking no older than 12 biked by and yelled, \u201cAsian domination! Go back to your own country!\u201d There were folks around\u2014all white, all older\u2014but no one looked, didn\u2019t even say a thing. I\u2019ve never even been across the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nStill, there were other reminders indicating that I did not conform to the traditional expectations of America\u2014in magazine racks at the supermarket or while window-shopping in the City. A flip through a beauty magazine usually meant more years spent toying with makeup, uninstructed. Shopping at large retailers only meant needing to special order my petite-sized jeans.\r\n\r\nI once knew a girl who went card shopping for Father\u2019s Day, looking specifically for a card featuring an Asian father. Having finally found a greeting card with an Asian baby on the cover, she flipped it open to find the words, \u201cCongratulations on your adoption.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus, still stands the definition of American that is left unspoken: one converging on white America. We amend the term to Asian American, Latin American, African American, because American alone doesn\u2019t seem to describe our plight. It seems to betray the struggles before us and omit the fact that America isn\u2019t always made for us minorities, that we still are very much confined by the skin from which we have tried to escape through our American identity.

Not all Chinese are from China, and to make such an erroneous assumption glosses over the tremendous diversity of the Chinese American community and marginalizes those whose families do not identify as Mandarin-speakers. Due to their proximity to the sea, the Chinese from Southern China (where Cantonese and other related dialects are spoken) were the first to migrate overseas and set up diasporic communities. The predominant language in all historic American Chinatowns has always been Cantonese or Toisanese. The primary purpose of languages is communication, not only with other people, but also with our families and personal histories. I trace my roots to the Southern Chinese communities in the Philippines, and though I never got a chance to learn it, I\u2019ve spent virtually all of my adolescent and young adult life in relentless pursuit of the language that used to belong to my family.

Asian American Studies Program Lecturer Harvey Dong describes Professor Takaki as \u201ca unique academic, an activist educator who challenged the master narrative, and who was and continues to be a model for a university tenured professor.\u201d Professor Ron Takaki passed away this June at the age of 70. His campus memorial three weeks ago was packed\u2014standing room only for just a small portion of the students, colleagues, family, and community members whose lives he has touched. Ethnic Studies professors, students, and family described a fun-loving and gregarious activist, committed both to his work and his family. Most strikingly, all spoke of Professor Takaki\u2019s commitment and contributions to Ethnic Studies, of his ground-breaking work as an academic, a teacher, and a public figure who contributed tirelessly to the field of multiculturalism. As I sat at his memorial in the International House auditorium, I couldn\u2019t help but think about how Professor Takaki\u2019s work and passing have affected me. Another of his quotes helps to explain why Asian American Studies is so important to me: \u201cThe task for us is not only to comprehend the world, but also to change the world. In our very comprehending, we are in fact changing the world.\u201d Asian American Studies has helped me to situate my life and my history in the the current racial, political, and social topography. It\u2019s provided me with the tools and the knowledge to bridge the divide between my where I came from and my family\u2019s history, and my experience at Berkeley, training for whatever career awaits. In comprehending an alternate history and an alternative way of looking at the world, I am changing my world. However, with Professor Takaki\u2019s passing, I am also reminded that Asian American Studies continues to exist only with the scholarship of our professors and the engagement of our students. With the recent budget cuts and the loss of two tenured professors in the program, Ronald Takaki and Ling-Chi Wang, where is the future of the program? Many of the professors I spoke with in the Asian American Studies (AAS) Program agreed that AAS is \u201cat a juncture,\u201d as Professor Michael Omi put it. One direction he is a part of is a move towards community based studies. Professor Omi is the UC Berkeley campus representative for the UC AAPI Multi-Campus Research Program, established to draw on resources system-wide to disseminate knowledge about AAPIs to California legislators and community based organizations. The University of California \u201chas an obligation to apply its research expertise to the study of AAPI related policies.\u201d Lecturer Hatem Bazian also links community engagement with the AAS program. His class, Muslims in America: Community and Institutions, emerged after 9\/11 and \u201cOur Asian American Studies Program is more than simply a major. It\u2019s our community of students, teachers, faculty, thinkers, and activists working together to understand and change the world. It\u2019s your story, it\u2019s my story, and it\u2019s our story.\u201d is now part of the AAS Program. In addition to Asia having the largest segment of Muslims, many South and Southeast Asians were targeted for backlash after 9\/11. As a result, bridges were created between the Muslim and APA communities\u2014 the Asian Law Caucus came forward and asked the Muslim community what they needed, and the Japanese American Citizens League co-sponsored events with the Muslim community. Even on campus, the Nikkei Student Union and the Muslim Students Association facilitated an event together highlighting their shared experiences of discrimination and backlash. Professor Bazian suggests that it\u2019s time that we all examine ourselves and determine where we can \u201cbring new energies\u201d to the program and the field. Professor Khatharya Um also focuses on the growth of the program, describing its transformation over the last few decades. The arrival of Southeast Asian refugees added new dimensions to the APA community and a \u201cnew layer of complexity\u201d with transnational ties even deeper and more entangled. There has been a growth of scholarship of Southeast Asians and a \u201ccloser bridging of disciplines.\u201d In the past, Asian Studies focused primarily on Asia, while Asian American Studies was primarily American-centric. However, now the field is becoming more transnational and diasporic, an identity which is being formalized in responses to student need in a name change of the program from Asian American Studies to Asian American and Diasporic Studies. How do these professors\u2019 views for the future fit into the reality of the AAS program\u2019s success? Chair of the Asian American Studies Program, Elaine Kim, points out that while the field is blossoming nationally, development at Berkeley has been slower in the last 20 years. Perhaps this is related to the fact that AAS faculty at Berkeley have been engaged elsewhere. According to Professor Kim, many of the faculty in the AAS Program advise graduate students, and many faculty are also busy holding administrative positions. Again, this raises the question of replenishing our AAS faculty. However, while our faculty may be dwindling, lecturers Hatem Bazian\u2019s and Harvey Dong\u2019s class sizes are growing. Enrollment in Professor Dong\u2019s AAS courses has increased, even though the university is cutting its size. Why then, is no search being conducted to hire new faculty for tenured positions? While it may not be a priority for the university, it is important that students are a \u201cpart of the conversation,\u201d as Professor Omi suggests, and express their vision of AAS. Students must make their needs known, because no involvement and no demand on the university means we\u2019re losing ground. \u201cIf you look back at history, the guarantors are the students,\u201d says Harvey Dong. \u201cIt\u2019s up to students to study the issues, decide whether or not they agree, and then question and make changes.\u201d Students are the \u201cliving testimonials,\u201d says Professor Um. They need to be \u201cout there, talking about why AAS is important.\u201d And so the question of faculty and resources continues to arise. While the need to replenish faculty predates the budget cuts, the overall budget crisis has made it that much harder to hire new faculty. Professor Um puts it bluntly: we need to replenish our faculty, or we are \u201cseriously in trouble.\u201d And, as many professors have said, it\u2019s up to the students to make their need for a robust AAS Program known. It\u2019s up to the students to decide what they need and agitate for it. After all, it is our university and our education. Our Asian American Studies Program is more than simply a major. It\u2019s our community of students, teachers, faculty, thinkers, and activists working together to understand and change the world. It\u2019s your story, it\u2019s my story, and it\u2019s our story. It\u2019s important that as students, we think about how Asian American Studies applies to us, and what we want to see from the program. Whether a major or not, we are still students in this community. It\u2019s time to become engaged, become involved, and become part of the discussion about the field of study that seeks to understand and disseminate knowledge that is so closely tied to our communities and ourselves. Whether your actions include becoming an AAS major, taking an AAS class, joining hardboiled or another community group, or simply continuing to educate yourself, it\u2019s time for action, learning, and development. In the words of the late Professor Ron Takaki: In our very comprehending, we are in fact changing the world.\n","html":"<em>Remembering Ronald Takaki and exploring Ethnic Studies<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>annie kim noguchi<\/strong>\r\n\r\nEach day, I read a quote I have posted above my desk: \u201cHow do we free ourselves from our past, if we do not even know this past?\u201d Author of this quote, Professor Ron Takaki (1939-2009), is often called the \u201cfather of multicultural studies.\u201d After the third world Liberation Front strikes in the 1960s, Professor Takaki was one of the first to offer courses on race, ethnicity, and community, eventually creating the first graduate-level program in Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nAsian American Studies Program Lecturer Harvey Dong describes Professor Takaki as \u201ca unique academic, an activist educator who challenged the master narrative, and who was and continues to be a model for a university tenured professor.\u201d Professor Ron Takaki passed away this June at the age of 70. His campus memorial three weeks ago was packed\u2014standing room only for just a small portion of the students, colleagues, family, and community members whose lives he has touched. Ethnic Studies professors, students, and family described a fun-loving and gregarious activist, committed both to his work and his family. Most strikingly, all spoke of Professor Takaki\u2019s commitment and contributions to Ethnic Studies, of his ground-breaking work as an academic, a teacher, and a public figure who contributed tirelessly to the field of multiculturalism.\r\n\r\nAs I sat at his memorial in the International House auditorium, I couldn\u2019t help but think about how Professor Takaki\u2019s work and passing have affected me. Another of his quotes helps to explain why Asian American Studies is so important to me: \u201cThe task for us is not only to comprehend the world, but also to change the world. In our very comprehending, we are in fact changing the world.\u201d\r\nAsian American Studies has helped me to situate my life and my history in the the current racial, political, and social topography. It\u2019s provided me with the tools and the knowledge to bridge the divide between my where I came from and my family\u2019s history, and my experience at Berkeley, training for whatever career awaits. In comprehending an alternate history and an alternative way of looking at the world, I am changing my world.\r\n\r\nHowever, with Professor Takaki\u2019s passing, I am also reminded that Asian American Studies continues to exist only with the scholarship of our professors and the engagement of our students. With the recent budget cuts and the loss of two tenured professors in the program, Ronald Takaki and Ling-Chi Wang, where is the future of the program? Many of the professors I spoke with in the Asian American Studies (AAS) Program agreed that AAS is \u201cat a juncture,\u201d as Professor Michael Omi put it. One direction he is a part of is a move towards community based studies. Professor Omi is the UC Berkeley campus representative for the UC AAPI Multi-Campus Research Program, established to draw on resources system-wide to disseminate knowledge about AAPIs to California legislators and community based\r\norganizations. The University of California \u201chas an obligation to apply its research expertise to the study of AAPI related policies.\u201d\r\n\r\nLecturer Hatem Bazian also links community engagement with the AAS program. His class, Muslims in America: Community and Institutions, emerged after 9\/11 and \u201cOur Asian American Studies Program is more than simply a major. It\u2019s our community of students, teachers, faculty, thinkers,\r\nand activists working together to understand and change the world. It\u2019s your story, it\u2019s my story, and it\u2019s our story.\u201d is now part of the AAS Program. In addition to Asia having the largest segment of Muslims, many South and Southeast Asians were targeted for backlash after 9\/11. As a result, bridges\r\nwere created between the Muslim and APA communities\u2014 the Asian Law Caucus came forward and asked the Muslim community what they needed, and the Japanese American Citizens League co-sponsored events with the Muslim community. Even on campus, the Nikkei Student Union and the Muslim Students Association facilitated an event together highlighting their shared experiences of discrimination and backlash. Professor Bazian suggests that it\u2019s time that we all examine ourselves and determine where we can \u201cbring new energies\u201d to the program and the field.\r\n\r\nProfessor Khatharya Um also focuses on the growth of the program, describing its transformation over the last few decades. The arrival of Southeast Asian refugees added new dimensions to the APA community and a \u201cnew layer of complexity\u201d with transnational ties even deeper and\r\nmore entangled. There has been a growth of scholarship of Southeast Asians and a \u201ccloser bridging of disciplines.\u201d In the past, Asian Studies focused primarily on Asia, while Asian American Studies was primarily American-centric. However, now the field is becoming more transnational and diasporic, an identity which is being formalized in responses to student\r\nneed in a name change of the program from Asian American Studies to Asian American and Diasporic Studies. How do these professors\u2019 views for the future fit into the reality of the AAS program\u2019s success? Chair of the Asian\r\nAmerican Studies Program, Elaine Kim, points out that while the field is blossoming nationally, development at Berkeley has been slower in the last 20 years. Perhaps this is related to the fact that AAS faculty at Berkeley have been engaged elsewhere. According to Professor Kim, many of the faculty in\r\nthe AAS Program advise graduate students, and many faculty are also busy holding administrative positions. Again, this raises the question of replenishing our AAS faculty. However, while our faculty may be dwindling, lecturers Hatem Bazian\u2019s and Harvey Dong\u2019s class sizes are growing. Enrollment in Professor Dong\u2019s AAS courses has increased, even though the university is cutting its size. Why then, is no search being conducted to hire new faculty for tenured positions? While it may not be a priority for the university, it is important that students are a \u201cpart of the conversation,\u201d as Professor Omi suggests, and express their vision of AAS. Students must make their needs known, because no involvement and no demand on the university means we\u2019re losing ground. \u201cIf you look back at history, the\r\nguarantors are the students,\u201d says Harvey Dong. \u201cIt\u2019s up to students to study the issues, decide whether or not they agree, and then question and make changes.\u201d Students are the \u201cliving testimonials,\u201d says Professor Um.

Besides a vaguely symbolic splotch of ink on a blank page, a word is a motley assortment of letters, symbols, pictographs, or sounds that the brain associates with some sort of meaning. As such, words of any language are merely components of a much greater concept; the concept of language itself, which everyone seems to have a say on. Philosophers such as Hobbes and Locke, for one, view language as a natural and inevitable extension of the speech which humans have within themselves. As university students, we make the decision whether to include the study of foreign languages as a part of our education. More often than not, however, linguistic classes are set aside in favor of science and business courses. But there are those who do feel that languages are worthy of study here at Cal. Renee Bell, a freshman, hails from Sacramento, but her mother was born in South Korea. Though her father is not of Asian descent, and she admits to being \u201cdefinitely not fluent in Korean,\u201d Bell maintains that learning to speak better Korean is an integral part of understanding her identity. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of my heritage. The language really appeals to me, I like a lot about it [such as] the sounds, the written language has its own history, and it\u2019s a cultural artifact in itself. Of course all languages are useful for a certain reason, but for me, Korean is a lot more personal. It\u2019s more than being useful\u2026 I have a certain obligation.\u201d To fulfill this obligation, she is taking Korean 1A. Her proficiency in the language, like that of many local-born Asian Americans, is largely limited and often not enough to \u201cengender a full conversation.\u201d But what stands out in students like Bell is a desire to improve the status quo. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something I wish to change,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially with the respect you have with your elders, you should definitely make the effort to communicate with them effectively.\u201d It would be a gross understatement to say that language is useful. Devoid of language, it would be simply impossible for us subsist as anything beyond a self-preserving sequence of chemical reactions. Language enables us to draw meaning from symbols and sounds as well as understand the concepts that define our very lives. Survival is ultimately achieved through communication; both communication with others, for biological and psychological sustenance, and the inner communication alluded to by Hobbes and Locke. Reflective dialogue within the self, to some degree, defends against the absurdity and irrationality of existence. More importantly, it allows others to understand and interpret our actions and thoughts long after we cease to live in the traditional sense. Language to me is a way we can feel a tangible connection to shadowy ancestors older than the Greeks, older than the Bible. By \u201cancestors\u201d I mean not only individuals directly related to my family, but rather, people that simply used my mother tongue. In a similar way, language enables me to feel connected to future generations. As such, I believe that language is something that will persist through all generations and offer a thread to weave them together. Butian Li is an international first-year student at Cal from Dalian, China. Attending English classes is mandatory in Chinese schools, and she says that the majority of high school graduates from China continue to sharpen their English ability. The comparison here is that Li is naturally fluent in Mandarin whilst attempting to improve her English, while local-born Asian Americans like Bell are fluent in English but are trying to relearn their native languages. Li says, \u201cEnglish is just a useful tool because I have to attend school here, and I have to learn English, even if I was in China. You can never know if it will be useful in the future. But I think in the very beginning you may learn a language as a matter of identification. I think language plays both roles.\u201d She also notes that appearance is a key factor in the assumptions people make regarding language proficiency or lack thereof. \u201cI think there\u2019s a difference between me learning English and those people who look [like they should be fluent in] Chinese but are actually not. For me, it\u2019s fine, because I think people still regard me as a foreigner, but for them, people have the assumption that [because they look Chinese], they should speak Chinese fluently.\u201d The linguistic stereotypes and expectations based on race mentioned by Li create a double standard that Asian-Americans of all backgrounds must face on a daily basis. Our endeavours to connect with the past are all limited by the constraints of our knowledge. I, for example, cannot trace my origins much further beyond the fact that my great-grandparents on both my father and mother\u2019s side were born in the Guangdong province of China. But what little I do know about my predecessors\u2014that they communicated using the Cantonese language (indeed, it\u2019s different enough from Mandarin to be considered a separate language)\u2014is enough for me to feel a connection with them. In other words, I need no more than a language to feel a link to past and present Cantonese speakers and to sufficiently trace my background. Like many local-born or otherwise \u201cWesternized\u201d Asian Americans, my fluency in my native tongue of Cantonese waned significantly by the time I started elementary school. It seemed to me a natural progress, for the television shows I watched, the toys I wanted, the books I read were all written in this West Germanic descendant known as English. And indeed I would argue that it is natural for a person born in the United States to lose not only proficiency in an immigrant native language, but also an appreciation for what it means to be a member of that immigrant community. As Asian Americans, somewhere down the line we all came fresh off a boat, a steamer or a canoe or a junk, and to deny this fact is to deny that at one point in time a particular ancestor of ours made a momentous journey that may well have terminated or initiated our bloodline with it. It is exceedingly paradoxical how we wish to live memorable lives that hopefully mean something to our posterity, while the memories of our own forerunners have been largely discarded. If communicating in their language is the best we can do to keep these memories alive, then we need to make it a priority to relearn that language. Members of the South Asian community are by no means excluded from this inner conflict. Prateek Thatikunta, another Cal freshman, was born and raised in San Jose. His family speaks Telugu, the primary language spoken by the people of Andhra Pradesh, one of the most prominent states in India. The fact that Telugu is the fourteenth most spoken language in the world, while only the third most spoken language in India, is a testament to the sheer amount of linguistic diversity in India and Asia as a whole. Thatikunta says that his ability to speak Telugu is sufficient to carry a conversation, since he has spoken it since he was born, but it \u201ccould definitely be better,\u201d and it \u201cgets worse and worse each year.\u201d This is a difficult trend to reverse for him, since, as he says, \u201cthe only time I speak Telugu is at home, and since I\u2019m not at home anymore, I definitely am going to be losing contact with it.\u201d However, he is satisfied with the fact that he is fairly fluent and can communicate with his parents and relatives. \u201cI\u2019ll never lose enough contact with Telugu that I can\u2019t speak it if I need to. I can always speak enough.\u201d Thatikunta is lucky in that he has largely escaped the language decay that befalls many second generation Asian-Americans; however, Telugu is nowhere near as accessible in terms of education on the Cal campus as is Korean or Chinese. As such he faces obstacles of different types in the common endeavour to retain native language ability. I would argue that this is an advantage to being Asian American\u2014we can identify with predecessors in our not-too-distant past, and with a collective culture that is becoming increasingly relevant in the present age to people of all ethnicities. Whether or not we as Asian Americans choose to identify with this community is a decision that I believe is as significant as the decision to immigrate in the first place. I recognize the irony behind this statement, given that it was written in what I hope to be persuasive and well-written English. But it is not from the Germanic and Latin roots of the English language that I draw the significance of these musings, but rather, from the broader understanding of the need to probe one\u2019s roots\u2014an understanding that can be expressed in every language known to man, including Cantonese. English to me represents a universal language, a vessel into which I can pour my thoughts. However, the dialect of Cantonese represents a vessel from which I can drink and be satiated by the thoughts of my ancestors. It is simply a matter of paying respect where I believe respect is due.

The Walkout on October 7<sup>th<\/sup>, 2010 was a success on many levels, but it lacked one of the most important factors: (wo)man-power. I saw a few of my classmates screaming \u201cOUR UNIVERSITY!\u201d in response to the question, \u201cWho\u2019s university?\u201d However, even though they were yelling at the top of their lungs, it seemed but a mere whisper against the rumbling of the cars that quickly made their way through Telegraph and Bancroft. \u00a0Many passersby glared at the picketers with a bothered look as they tried to appear as unseen as possible; so as not to be stopped and educated by one of \u201cthose\u201d folks.\u00a0 Some even had the nerves to stand and watch for a few minutes as they laughed to themselves and gobbled down their bagels as if the picketers were clowns at a birthday party. On a positive note, the fact that these picketers were seen and noticed by people that may not have known very much about the shitty budget before, makes taking the chuckles arguably worth it. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me this is the teach-in\u201d was my first thought as I saw only six people gather to sit in front of California Hall. It was. I walked over and joined them, greeted by one of the three individuals running the teach-in, which happened to be about the UC budget. To my surprise, the three individuals running the teach-in were Graduate Student Instructors who were extremely passionate about teaching us about what was going on and why we (and our fellow students) should care about this issue of the hike in student fees. A packet full of useful information telling about the allocation of the money accumulated from student fees and the state, was given to each individual who was there and those who would later join us. After sitting in on about thirty-minutes of this teach-in, my feelings of pity and anger for the strikers\/picketers suddenly turned into regret and anger at myself. I could have been one of those chanting with them, showing Yudolf and the UC regents that we students are not going to give in or back down. My anger and anxiety increased as we began to explore and question more aspects of the current situation with the concentration of wealth and lack of opportunities for many communities. When looking at the handout that was given to us, a freshman woman asked, \u201cWhy does it say student fees and not tuition?\u201d The response, as the teach-in leader pointed out, was because legally since the UCs are public schools and state funded, they are not able to charge student \u201ctuition fees;\u201d however, the UC regents and Yudolf can sugarcoat the fuck out of the meaning and call it \u201cfees.\u201d\u00a0 If you take a look at the various categories for these \u201cfees\u201d it gets quite ridiculous as to how many categories there actually are and how the less collectively useful it gets, the more money it seems to be allocated. If one was to go online to check out the *University of California Student Fee Policy* at [http:\/\/www.universtiyofcalifornia.edu\/regents\/policies\/3101.html](http:\/\/www.universtiyofcalifornia.edu\/regents\/policies\/3101.html) it clearly states that the \u201cprimary focus of Student Services Fee **should not** be on programs\u201d such as the immediate office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, who nonetheless receives about $800,000; more than the total money allocated to the Student Learning Center (which received a whopping $8,871 in 2009-10) and the Student life Advising Services (which received $112,001 in 2009-10) combined! The teach-in further explored the \u201cCalifornia Master Plan\u201d and it\u2019s original three-tier system of Community Colleges, CSUs (California State Universities), and then the UCs at the top; all three of which would be largely (if not fully) funded by the state government. The intention of this \u201cplan\u201d was to make education accessible to all Californians, despite their economic backgrounds. Thus, for those that attended Community Colleges, the intention would be for them to eventually go on to CSUs and UCs. \u00a0The master plan lasted about ten years and officially fell out in 2004 when California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the UC regents decided to largely privatize the funding of the UC system. By 10:15 AM, things started to look a little better and brighter with several congregations of teach-ins. There were about six groups of about eleven people; my own teach-in group had grown also to about ten people. Each teach-in group had different topics, all of which were relevant to the original intent of the walkout. Each topic was well-thought through and thoroughly internalized; the only fault would be the lack of people to tell the information to. The problem with this logic though, is that the people that would benefit most from calling the UC Regents out on these fee hikes are often the one who are the most unwilling. This goes with the logic of how those that have the most to gain, also have the most to lose. Some deem the walkout\/picketing not worth skipping a day of class which they pay $100+ dollars for. The fact of the matter is, these questions and concerns need to be thoroughly addressed in order to convince our fellow students that this fight is worth fighting for.\n\n\n","html":"As I approached Sproul Plaza and saw a group of about only twenty-one people picketing, my heart sank. The Walkout on October 7<sup>th<\/sup>, 2010 was a success on many levels, but it lacked one of the most important factors: (wo)man-power.\r\n\r\nI saw a few of my classmates screaming \u201cOUR UNIVERSITY!\u201d in response to the question, \u201cWho\u2019s university?\u201d However, even though they were yelling at the top of their lungs, it seemed but a mere whisper against the rumbling of the cars that quickly made their way through Telegraph and Bancroft. \u00a0Many passersby glared at the picketers with a bothered look as they tried to appear as unseen as possible; so as not to be stopped and educated by one of \u201cthose\u201d folks.\u00a0 Some even had the nerves to stand and watch for a few minutes as they laughed to themselves and gobbled down their bagels as if the picketers were clowns at a birthday party.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, the fact that these picketers were seen and noticed by people that may not have known very much about the shitty budget before, makes taking the chuckles arguably worth it.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me this is the teach-in\u201d was my first thought as I saw only six people gather to sit in front of California Hall.\r\n\r\nIt was.\r\n\r\nI walked over and joined them, greeted by one of the three individuals running the teach-in, which happened to be about the UC budget.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, the three individuals running the teach-in were Graduate Student Instructors who were extremely passionate about teaching us about what was going on and why we (and our fellow students) should care about this issue of the hike in student fees. A packet full of useful information telling about the allocation of the money accumulated from student fees and the state, was given to each individual who was there and those who would later join us. After sitting in on about thirty-minutes of this teach-in, my feelings of pity and anger for the strikers\/picketers suddenly turned into regret and anger at myself. I could have been one of those chanting with them, showing Yudolf and the UC regents that we students are not going to give in or back down.\r\n\r\nMy anger and anxiety increased as we began to explore and question more aspects of the current situation with the concentration of wealth and lack of opportunities for many communities.

On September 15, 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials apprehended Steve Li, a 20 year-old nursing student at City College. Li, who was born in Peru, is currently being held alone in Arizona and awaiting deportation to his birth country. His parents were since released and are awaiting potential deportation to China; however, ICE officials have neglected to explicate why Li was separated from his family. Li\u2019s story is simply one of the expected 400,000 deportations that will be occurring this fiscal year, almost 10 percent over the Bush administration's 2008 total. While it is legally correct that the Li family broke the law in illicitly staying in San Francisco, their story illustrates that the law itself is inherently broken. Until his arrest, Li was unaware of his illegal status and simply attempting to live the tale of hard work and perseverance indoctrinated into every American. Li\u2019s family did in fact previously attempt to gain documentation, but their petition for political asylum was denied in 2003 and in 2004. This case is a testament to the fractured immigration system that, on a quotidian basis, deals out inhumane treatment to a racialized underclass--including the prized \u201cmodel minority\u201d of stratified American society. As Asian Americans and students at Berkeley, however, we do not aim to advocate for Li because he is a disempowered individual. Our outrage is predicated by the fact that Li is a student just like us and could have been anyone in our communities. According to a report by the University of California Office of the President, Asian\/Pacific Islander students constitute 40-44% of undocumented students in the UC system. For obvious reasons, undocumented students of any race typically do not put their illegal statuses up for exhibition. Though we may not know who among our friends and classmates are next, we do know that unjust institutional factors constantly threaten members of our community whose struggles are most invisible. It is imperative to recognize that Li\u2019s case is not a historical juggernaut for our community. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred the immigration of Chinese nationals to the U.S., emerging as the first conspicuously racist exclusive immigration law in this nation\u2019s history. The California Alien Land Act of 1913 prohibited Asians already in the country (referred to as \u201caliens ineligible for citizenship\u201d) from owning property. Given that the first anti-immigrant laws targeted Asian Americans over a century ago and that we are about to deport an Asian American for a crime he didn\u2019t even realize he committed, it is blatantly incorrect to say that we have learned from our past and that our history of facing discrimination is over. It is for this reason that we denounce the detention of Steve Li and urge elected officials to stand up against it, for our communities, and for our future.

Here are some things you can do to show your support: 1) Sign on to the Asian American Justice Center's AAPI Student Sign-On Letter at [http:\/\/bit.ly\/dreamaapi](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dreamaapi) (this takes like 30 seconds) 2) Call your HOR Representative or Senator: You can make a simple call to the **House: 1-866-220-0044** or Senate**: (866) 996-5161 **and ask to be transfered to your Representative's* office. Search for your Representative in the chart below by searching for your County and make a less-than-one-minute call saying: **Hi, my name is _____ and I'm a UC Berkeley student from _____ City\/County. I\u2019m calling to urge Representative _______ to vote YES on the DREAM Act when it comes up for a vote next week. Thank you!\u201d**\n\n> <span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">**FIND YOUR REPRESENTATIVE HERE:**<\/span><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"394\"><colgroup><col width=\"98\"><\/col><col width=\"40\"><\/col><col width=\"170\"><\/col><col width=\"70\"><\/col><\/colgroup><tbody><tr><td width=\"98\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**County**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"40\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**District**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"170\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**Representative**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"70\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**Supporter?***<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=\"98\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**Alameda**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"40\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**11**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"170\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**Jerry McNerneya**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"70\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**Undecided**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=\"98\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**Amador**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"40\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**3**<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/td><td width=\"170\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**Daniel E.

Let's make this DREAM happen.\n","html":"With your help, we were able to delay Steve Li's deportation by prompting the intervention of Senator Dianne Feinstein, but it's still not over. Steve has been constantly lauded in the media as a prime example of a beneficiary for the DREAM Act, an act that would provide a pathway to legalization for undocumented students and undocumented individuals serving in the military, provided they fit certain criteria (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dreamactivist.org\/text-of-dream-act-legislation\/general-faq\/\">http:\/\/www.dreamactivist.org\/text-of-dream-act-legislation\/general-faq\/<\/a> for details).\r\n\r\nThough it's by no means a permanent solution (and it would be highly erroneous and detrimental to assume the passage of the DREAM Act would solve the problems and hardships felt by the undocumented community), this is a huge step in the right direction that would really help many of our friends and classmates, including the 40-44% of undocumented students in the UC system who are API.\u00a0Thanks to Congress' lame duck session, the DREAM Act has come up for a vote THIS WEDNESDAY.

I soon found myself frequenting Durant Food Court, popularly known as the \"Asian Ghetto,\" for my fix of Asian Cuisine. Perusing each restaurant one by one, I discovered that Thai Basil\u2019s Basil Combination Fried Rice really did melt in your mouth, that Bear Ramen House had some tasty Spam Kimchi fried rice, and the list goes on. But you can only eat food out of clear containers and plastic bags for so long. There was something about the steaming bowls of hot rice cake stew, broiled just the way they\u2019re supposed to, and the side dishes that have always accompanied my entrees at home that never failed to soothe me. I missed it; and after a while, I found it. As it turned out, familiar foods were just around the corner. I didn\u2019t have to go too far to discover Espresso Experience. Located on Bancroft directly across from Bear\u2019s Lair, I was immediately attracted to the words \"bulgogi sandwich.\" I\u2019ve had bulgogi, and I\u2019ve had sandwiches but why would you put the two together? I was soon shown that you could in fact put them together, and the Korean couple that owns this quaint restaurant caf\u00e9 proves that you can do it well. Their personable attitudes and impeccable memory make you feel remembered each time you walk in. The extra conversation that went on the other day even after I ordered my bulgogi sandwich and side of shaved ice was refreshing and reminded me of my own mother, who\u2019d ask about my day as I ate an after school snack at the dining table. But when I want Korean food served the way my own mother does at home, I go to Toust in Sather Lane. The past few stores that occupied this space in the lane all had a rather short running track, but Toust has managed to stay open for over a year now. I attribute their success to the Korean grandmother chef who cooks food like she\u2019s still in Korea. Served in traditional Korean stone pots with metal silverware and complete with traditional Korean side dishes, Toust offers quality food at low prices that make you forget you\u2019re a broke college student looking for a good deal. Located on Telegraph and Dwight, Racha Caf\u00e9 is tucked a little further way from the typical Telegraph restaurants we see on our walk to campus and back, making it an easy place to get away and forget that you still are in Berkeley while enjoying an authentic Thai dish. The traditional Thai d\u00e9cor and wall art definitely helps with that too. The restaurant is pretty spacious and usually not crowded, unlike the other Thai restaurants in the area where you\u2019re usually pushed up against the wall and can hear the conversations at all the tables surrounding you. This is the place I go to when I want to get away from campus and still enjoy an authentic bowl of pad see ew at college student prices. As winter draws near and the cold Berkeley weather settles in, what could be better and more comforting than a warm bowl of pho? PhoHoa on Shattuck and Kittredge was the first restaurant I tried in Berkeley and since then I\u2019ve gone back at least once a month for a good, cheap bowl of pho that never changes each time I go. In fact, you can even build your own pho at this place! But the best part is that there are so many more entrees beyond the regular #2 that I was surprised when a friend ordered a salmon dish over pho. And here I thought pho was their forte. The salmon dish is well prepared and served with extra side dishes. Their menu also includes the Thai iced teas I love. Sometimes you\u2019re not in such a quick rush to grab a good meal, and you want to splurge on something nice. Either that, or your parents are in town to visit and you can actually get them to pay for a good meal that\u2019s authentic enough to feel like home-cooked food. Great China, located on Kittredge and Oxford, is definitely one of my favorites in the Berkeley area. The two-story restaurant is always busy and I\u2019ve always had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. Yet the wait is definitely worth it because the food is tasty and it\u2019s an easy place to feel as if you\u2019re surrounded by family. The large circular tables and circular tray centered in the middle reminds me of all my favorite Chinese restaurants. Great China offers a wide array of food for not-so-expensive prices. This is the next place I\u2019m taking my family when they come to visit. Since I\u2019ve discovered these restaurants, I know where to go when I get the itch for something homemade. While none of these restaurants can actually be exactly what you\u2019re missing from home, they definitely can help. Sometimes when you\u2019re sick and in need of that little something from home to comfort you, a bowl of comfort food is just the right pick-me-up to get you going again.\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>that take you back home<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>rachel lee<\/strong><\/p>\r\nWhen I first came to Berkeley as a freshman, I often turned to Asian food to remind myself of home and ease my homesickness.

Weeks of unprecedented student and faculty criticism towards the state and university administration culminated in this historic walkout. It also marked the first instance in these weeks of organizing and debate that the budget proposals\u2019 impact on API students was openly discussed outside of API spaces.Lack of discussion on the budget cuts\u2019 impact on APIs is the largest obstacle preventing APIs from creating a unified stance on this issue. The fact that students will be paying more for longer waitlists, larger classes, decreased resources and a generally lower quality education should not be an issue that garners apathy. Rally speakers and students alike have lauded the walkout\u2019s success, likening it to the protests of the Free Speech Movement and declaring it the return of a long-dormant tradition of Berkeley activism; however, reported figures of attendance prove meager when compared to the sheer amount of API students whom the proposals will adversely impact. The amount of APIs at the walkout was obviously less than 5,000. APIs constitute about 45% of the student body, and the fact that our numbers alone could potentially effect real change but have not been utilized to their full potential is shameful. It is imperative to examine the implications of these budget proposals\u2019 effects on API students. These cuts would slice students\u2019 bank accounts at the jugular for visibly lower-quality academic services, which is reason enough to take alarm. However, these cuts would also impact Berkeley in several different ways, making huge blows to not only APIs but API interests\u2014that is, the values and goals that give direction to the API community and ensure that it transcends merely racially-based organizing. Here\u2019s a summary of three major ways in which these budget cuts will directly impact API students and API interests: 1. Vindication for cutting classes, departments, and educational programs relevant to API interests Historically, ethnic studies, the department that houses Berkeley\u2019s Asian American studies program, has been continuously assailed by budget cuts. These cuts were often backed by an unfortunately pervasive and incorrect view that the discipline promotes racism and self-segregation by concentrating on race and racial history. Opposition to the department has existed since its inception, and has frequently materialized through budget cuts and hiring policies that inhibit the young department\u2019s growth. According to department chair Beatriz Manz in a May 4, 2009 article in The Daily Californian, the department took an 8% budget blow this year. Given its highly contentious status, it is unsurprising that both Berkeley and UC administrators have frequently placed the department on the chopping block. Times of economic crisis make it easier for the administration to squelch ethnic studies and repress the expansion of Asian American studies curricula, despite an increasing number of API students. These proposals threaten not only ethnic studies and Asian American studies, but also other classes relevant to APIs and API student development, such as language classes. The victory of the student movement to protect East Asian Language from the budget cuts in 2008 is rendered irrelevant with the current threat. According to a September 10 radio interview given by API Education and Languages NOW! members Andrew Leong and Amy Lee, the most current most pressing issue is job security for non-tenured lecturers, members of faculty most vulnerable to lay-offs. Asian language classes are taught by lecturers rather than tenured professors, rendering them most susceptible to cuts. Not only do lecturers work more hours and make less than professors, but they are also prohibited from striking due to union-negotiated contracts, according to Leong and Lee. It thus does not matter how many exponentially the API student body grows or how high the demand for language courses is. Shortages of lecturers indubitably translate into shortages of API language classes, especially those that have been continuously trivialized as \"service courses,\" marginal contributions to students\u2019 holistic edifications. 2. Exclusion of lowand middle-income APIs from enrollingespecially in pre-professional fields such as business and engineering It is already obvious that such dramatic tuition raises will price out API students from underserved, low-income communities, but similarly damaging are the differential fees levied on students in business and engineering. The notion that an additional $1,000 fee on business and engineering students would effectively preserve the character and diversity of Haas or the College of Engineering assumes the homogenization of these colleges\u2019 student bodies. This dangerously insinuates the validity of the \"model minority\" myth when it comes to API students. The model minority myth, which erroneously proclaims that Asian Americans are somehow inherently genetically wired to succeed, is already an assumption that has deleteriously steered UC admission policies against API students. When UC President Mark Yudof was asked by Los Angeles Times about how Asian American students would be affected by the new UC admissions standard he off-handedly replied, \"They\u2019ll be fine.\"In theory, this fee fortifies the existing \"glass ceiling\" that looms over APIs in professional fields by restricting the social mobility of APIs and other students of color from low-income backgrounds. Berkeley is consistently ranked among the top ten of business and engineering undergraduate programs, and is notably one of the few public universities that can boast such high rankings. Such fees will deny one of the most viable resources for social mobility to many low-income and now middle-income students of color, who are concomitantly unable to qualify for financial aid and afford mounting student fees. \"When you think about engineering and b-students, there are already students of color struggling to keep themselves in those majors,\" said Jennifer Phung, External Relations Coordinator for REACH!, Berkeley\u2019s Asian\/Pacific Islander Recruitment and Retention Center. The high propensity for financial success is largely what attracts underserved APIs to pre-professional majors. Given the increasing costs of getting into college in the first place, the imposition of high differential fees would put underserved APIs at an even greater disadvantage to attain educational access and would further exacerbate their underrepresentation in various levels of these professional fields. 3. Smaller API progressive spaces, resulting in a silenced voice for API interests and issuesA less salient point in the ongoing dialogue in how budget cuts affect students of color is the decrease of students in the progressive community. Berkeley\u2019s progressive communities are responsible for initiating and defending such academic programs as ethnic studies and Asian language courses (Tagalog, for example, began as a DeCal course), as well as spearheading efforts to recruit students of color What has emerged from underprivileged API students\u2019 abilities to achieve educational access at Berkeley is the student leadership that allows the API community to have a voice. Many of these involved students come from underserved communities in California, and the proposed decrease of in-state enrollment will indirectly quell this voice. This would occur through a variety of consequences: firstly, the college admissions process already favors wealthier students, and reduced spots for resident students make the jobs of low-income API applicants even harder. Secondly, despite the rhetoric surrounding this issue, this policy was not designed to benefit out-of-state and international students, but rather, to benefit those who can pay the exorbitant out-of-state tuition. It is in this way that these proposals also diminish the education of progressive out-of-state students; the mistreatment of immigrant workers, hindrances to API political power and the displacement of Chinatown and Manilatown residents occur not only in Oakland and San Francisco, but also in Philadelphia, Boston, Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn. A reduction in in-state students who drive these progressive communities will result in less people from whom out-of-state students can learn. As the number one public university, Berkeley has an obligation to educate the world, and in straying from its roots, it does all of its students a huge disservice in allowing them to advance the communities from where they come, from wherever they may come. It is as such that the proposed budget plans will affect all aspects of the API community, its students, and its interests. In the aftermath of the September 24 walkout, the question that hangs above everyone\u2019s heads is what to do next. Nonetheless, the question of how the cuts will affect the API community must be widely addressed before tackling the question of how APIs can effectively solidify this movement.\n","html":"<em>How present budget proposals threaten the voice and interests of Cal 's API community<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>denise wong<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\u00a0On September 24, 2009, approximately 5,000 demonstrators stormed both Sproul Plaza and downtown Berkeley as part of a system-wide walkout against the Regents of the University of California\u2019s mismanagement of the current budget crisis. Weeks of unprecedented student and faculty criticism towards the state and university administration culminated in this historic walkout. It also marked the first instance in these weeks of organizing and debate that the budget proposals\u2019 impact on API students was openly discussed outside of API spaces.Lack of discussion on the budget cuts\u2019 impact on APIs is the largest obstacle preventing APIs from creating a unified stance on this issue. The fact that students will be paying more for longer waitlists, larger classes, decreased resources and a generally lower quality education should not be an issue that garners apathy. Rally speakers and students alike have lauded the walkout\u2019s success, likening it to the protests of the Free Speech Movement and declaring it the return of a long-dormant tradition of Berkeley activism; however, reported figures of attendance prove meager when compared to the sheer amount of API students whom the proposals will adversely impact. The amount of APIs at the walkout was obviously less than 5,000. APIs constitute about 45% of the student body, and the fact that our numbers alone could potentially effect real change but have not been utilized to their full potential is shameful.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to examine the implications of these budget proposals\u2019 effects on API students. These cuts would slice students\u2019 bank accounts at the jugular for visibly lower-quality academic services, which is reason enough to take alarm. However, these cuts would also impact Berkeley in several different ways, making huge blows to not only APIs but API interests\u2014that is, the values and goals that give direction to the API community and ensure that it transcends merely racially-based organizing. Here\u2019s a summary of three major ways in which these budget cuts will directly impact API students and API interests:\r\n\r\n1. Vindication for cutting classes, departments, and educational programs relevant to API interests\r\nHistorically, ethnic studies, the department that houses Berkeley\u2019s Asian American studies program, has been continuously assailed by budget cuts. These cuts were often backed by an unfortunately pervasive and incorrect view that the discipline promotes racism and self-segregation by concentrating on race and racial history. Opposition to the department has existed since its inception, and has frequently materialized through budget cuts and hiring policies that inhibit the young department\u2019s growth. According to department chair Beatriz Manz in a May 4, 2009 article in The Daily Californian, the department took an 8% budget blow this year. Given its highly contentious status, it is unsurprising that both Berkeley and UC administrators have frequently placed the department on the chopping block. Times of economic crisis make it easier for the administration to squelch ethnic studies and repress the expansion of Asian American studies curricula, despite an increasing number of API students.\r\n\r\nThese proposals threaten not only ethnic studies and Asian American studies, but also other classes relevant to APIs and API student development, such as language classes. The victory of the student movement to protect East Asian Language from the budget cuts in 2008 is rendered irrelevant with the current threat. According to a September 10 radio interview given by API Education and Languages NOW! members Andrew Leong and Amy Lee, the most current most pressing issue is job security for non-tenured lecturers, members of faculty most vulnerable to lay-offs.

Exclusion of lowand middle-income APIs from enrollingespecially in pre-professional fields such as business and engineering \r\nIt is already obvious that such dramatic tuition raises will price out API students from underserved, low-income communities, but similarly damaging are the differential fees levied on students in business and engineering.

These discriminatory laws, which affected about 25,000 Chinese immigrants, denied Chinese the rights to own property, marry white women, work in the public sector, and testify against whites in court. The new bill also acknowledges the work Chinese Americans contributed in constructing nearly 80% of the Western portion of the Transcontinental Railroad. It ends with listing quite a few Chinese Americans CEOs in big companies who have \"made\" it in today\u2019s society. Most importantly, an apology is meant not only to express regret for what happened, but also to recognize what led up to the mistakes made. In this case, there should have been a greater emphasis in the bill on why California decided to ban Chinese immigrants in the past: for example, because of the color of their skin. In addition, the bill should have addressed how the racist laws affected Chinese immigrants psychologically\u2014how did the Chinese feel about the grand scale of discrimination against them? But nowhere does the bill explicitly state these issues. However, almost everything described on the bill can easily be found in any history book that discusses Chinese Americans. Yes, it is important to talk about what happened, but the bill looks more like a list of historic events involving Chinese Americans than an apology. It does not explicitly address the racial injustices behind the laws. It barely even mentions the word \"racism.\" It goes on to talk about the Statue of Liberty and how the laws did not adhere to the American ideals of freedom and hope. Oh. Like we didn\u2019t know that already. This isn\u2019t the first time a government has made an apology for what it has done to its people in the past. In 2006, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to Chinese Canadians for the unequal taxes forced upon them in the late 19th century. In February 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made an apology to the Aborigines for past racist laws, especially the one that forced separation of children from their parents. Five months afterward, the United States Congress made a formal apology to African Americans for slavery and the infamous Jim Crow laws. Perhaps most famous of all, in 1988 President Ronald Reagan signed the historical Civil Liberties Act that granted each of the surviving 120,000 Japanese American internees $20,000 dollars in reparation for their imprisonment in internment camps during World War II. But what is the purpose of California\u2019s apology? An apology is a sincere, heartfelt statement that expresses guilt or regret for one\u2019s past actions. One reason we say sorry is because we hurt other people\u2019s feelings by doing something wrong. To say you are sorry does not mean making reparations or passing a formal bill. The word \"sorry\" did not even appear at all in the bill. So was this bill passed only as a result of pressure from Chinese communities, as California hopes to look good by admitting its \"wrong\" and showing responsibility for the past? Or is California just following the \"wave\" of apologies other countries have made to their people? The bill expresses its \"regrets\" for the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first federal law that excluded an entire population based solely on nationality. This law virtually denied all ethnic Chinese immigrants entry to the United States. It was followed by the Scott Act of 1888, which prohibited re-entry to the U.S. for undocumented Chinese immigrants who were here before 1882. The Geary Act of 1892 renewed the Chinese Exclusion Act for 10 years. Finally, in 1902 the law was extended indefinitely to exclude all Chinese from entering the U.S., until it was repealed by the Magnuson Act of 1943. Large scale immigration for the Chinese did not take place until the passing of the Immigration Act of 1965, which finally opened up entry to the United States for various immigrant groups. These were just a few of the racist laws against the Chinese. Does an apology on a good ol\u2019 summery day in July compensate for over 150 years of painful discriminatory practices imposed on Chinese immigrants? No. But wait. That\u2019s not all. What about the immigrants who weren\u2019t Chinese? They suffered racial discrimination and multiple racist laws as well. The Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, Laos, Cambodian, and South Asian Indians immigrants all experienced racial discrimination during the same time period in California, but have yet to receive any formal apology. Once again, the California State Legislature has made the infamous mistake of overlooking the distinct identities of different Asian American groups. Other Asian ethnic groups, not just the Chinese, were also affected by the \"perpetual foreigner\" ideology, and each clearly had its own unique struggles with racial discrimination in America. One cannot deny the fact that so many years passed before this apology came along. Most of the victims of these discriminatory laws have already died. So who is California apologizing to? Is it to the descendants of the Chinese immigrants so that we don\u2019t make a big fuss over the government\u2019s past wrongs? Assemblyman Paul Fong (D-Cupertino), who co-sponsored the apology bill, asserted that \"By apologizing, we\u2019ll hopefully close those wounds and close a sad chapter in our history.\" I don\u2019t agree. An apology cannot \"close\" wounds inflicted by racist laws over a century ago. An apology cannot account for all the Chinese Americans endured, struggles that still leave behind their emotional marks on the second or third Chinese generation today. An apology cannot eliminate history. If the purpose of this apology is just to close a sad chapter in the history of America, then there is no meaning in it. I believe that to some extent, California issued this apology to save face for its legislature. By mentioning a few Chinese Americans CEOs and members in Congress, the bill tries to make a sort of amends for its injustices. This inclusion in the bill is somewhat awkward, because it is as if having Chinese Americans in these positions can right the wrong of racial discrimination. Of course it is important to have representation of Chinese Americans in the business or political arenas and to acknowledge their achievements, but mentioning this in an apology bill is inappropriate. It suggests that California has now somehow compensated for the past since there are Chinese Americans at the top of the social ladder and part of the political world today. The bill seems to infer that simply being Chinese, rather than their abilities, led them to those prestigious positions. As a Chinese American, I will never forget the history of my ancestors in this country. The chapter will never close. The wounds will always be there, to remind me of what it took for me to be here, right now, living in the freedom paid for by the pain my ancestors felt throughout the past decades. It is definitely a step forward for Chinese Americans now that California is admitting its past prejudice toward Chinese Americans and bringing light to the often hidden history of Asian Americans in general. I do applaud the bill for acknowledging the contributions of Chinese Americans and recognizing California\u2019s past racial discrimination toward immigrant minority groups. I also applaud the bill for confessing the fact that this discrimination did not represent the ideals of freedom and equality promised to all of America. But it is certainly debatable how real and sincere this apology is. After all, it is mostly a regurgitation of the history of Chinese Americans. More importantly, the bill does not really focus on the reasons behind the injustices. It never mentions the emotional or psychological impact of racial discrimination\u2014how the laws changed the way Chinese immigrants faced their struggles and lived in America. It never brings up how hard it was for Chinese Americans to make a stand in today\u2019s society. Moreover, if this is an apology for California\u2019s past racial discrimination against immigrants, then there should be a formal apology to each of the ethnic minority groups that have had marked a history in California. If not, then don\u2019t call it an apology. Call it an acknowledgment of Chinese Americans\u2019 contributions to the growth of California. Is it truly an apology if it comes 159 years after the fact, after thousands of Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans have already been put through a living hell? I don\u2019t think so.\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>California State Legislature officially apologizes to Chinese Americans for past racial discriminatory laws<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><\/em>by <strong>michell ho<\/strong><\/p>\r\nOn July 17th, the California State Legislature quietly passed the Assembly Concurrent Resolution (ACR) 42, a bill meant to officially apologize to the state\u2019s Chinese American community for racial discriminatory laws passed as far back as the Gold Rush of the 1850\u2019s.

The term seems relatively simple: American-born persons of Asian descent. But for many South Asian students on the Berkeley campus, the term is a little more complicated than that. \"People tend to think of Asian American as [East Asian]... Filipino or Chinese,\" Amit Kapadia, a second-year, said. The term \"Asian American\" was first coined by activists in the 1960s. Their intent was to create a pan-ethnic community encompassing a variety of different Asian ethnicities that would come together to address issues such as stereotypes and racial discrimination. To a large extent, this goal of stirring political and social activism within the Asian American community was achieved, as demonstrated by the formation of the Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA) in 1968 by Berkeley graduate student Yuji Ichioka. Along with the Third World Liberation Front, the AAPA and other organizations pushed for the formation of an Ethnic Studies program on the Berkeley campus. With the establishment of the Ethnic Studies program also emerged other disciplines, including South and Southeast Asian Studies. But even before the establishment of the latter, the university already had a history with South Asian discourse. The Center for South Asian Studies (CSAS) was established in 1959, dedicating its study to India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and the Maldives. The term \"South Asian\" has been considered to fall under the larger umbrella of \"Asian American.\" However there is some dispute about this grouping. Borne out of a purpose to include people of diverse backgrounds, the term \"Asian American\" has come to mean different things to different people. \"I would to an extent [consider myself Asian American]. But not at Berkeley; there are [many Asian] countries represented here, a large majority of them are East Asian. When people think of Asian American, they think of Chinese. It has to do with the mentality of other people. They tend to group people together as Asian American,\" Astrid Fernandes, a second year, said. She identifies more with the South Asian community. Although Berkeley does offer many South Asian languages such as Sanskrit, Punjabi, Hindi-Urdu, and Bengali, according to graduate student instructor Joina Hsiao there is a tendency for an East Asian focus within the Ethnic Studies program. While students have the opportunity to major in Chinese and Japanese, they cannot do so for South Asian languages. In addition, funding for the Chinese and Japanese languages is greater because they are established majors. So why the focus on East Asia in our course offerings? Is it due to a lack of demand or interest in South Asian courses? Perhaps the problem extends beyond the limits of the campus; an East Asian focus can be seen outside Berkeley as well. Hollywood often characterizes Asian Americans as East Asian, but rarely as South Asian or Southeast Asian for that matter. The focus on East Asians in the mainstream media is perpetuated in our course offerings. In any case, there needs to be more focus on South Asian studies and more equality in class offerings. Having courses in a variety of disciplines is important in educating students about the unique aspects of different cultures. \"I believe that East Asians and South Asians enjoy a flux of rich traditions and cultural practices. Some common concepts that reverberate throughout these two cultures are the idea of respecting elders and engaging in ritualistic, religious celebrations according to the lunar calendar. The cross-cultural adaptation of Buddhism also creates some religious and philosophically similar practices and artistic depictions. We also delight in the seemingly-exotic spices in our diverse dishes and speak a multitude of regional languages,\" Ameeti Mishra, the South Asian Coalition Building Director at Berkeley, said. While South Asians do have cultural and religious similarities with East Asians, it is also important to note the differences. Hsiao postulates that South Asian students may not want to identify themselves with the term \"Asian American\" because it takes away a certain distinction. While Asian cultures do have similarities, students don\u2019t necessarily want to be put in a seemingly homogeneous group. \"People should be aware of the differences, culturally, linguistically, religiously,\" Hsiao said. This sentiment is affirmed by second-year Akshay Nathawat, who feels that the term \"Asian American\" is too inclusive. \"We should look at humanity as itself. Categorizing is not the best way. Culturally, it works, but when we categorize according to look or behavior, it\u2019s not the best way,\" Nathawat said. Being aware of the differences in culture, languages, and religion is an important part of recognizing individuality. These aspects can define a significant part of a person\u2019s identity. For instance, some South Asians choose not eat beef in honor of their religion. For them, religion is very much a large part of their identity and understanding this point is important in acknowledging their individuality. When we fail to understand the distinctions between cultures, we also fail to see people as the unique individuals that they are. The tendency to think of \"Asian Americans\" as a homogenous group is a problem for many students. Fernandes believes that emphasizing geography in classrooms is something that could be done to raise awareness about other nationalities or ethnicities that fall under the Asian American category. \"We could change what people think of as Asian geography. Also emphasizing global studies. People just need to know early on about these issues. Also mass advertising and having distinctive categories on the application process. The frustrating part is that on applications, they aren\u2019t consistent. They have a separate group for Middle Eastern, but not for others,\" Fernandes said. One way that students can educate themselves about the different regions of the world is though the International and Area Studies program at Berkeley, which comprises of prominent scholars from all over the world. Categorizing leads to the tendency to homogenize a group of people, concealing their cultural, religious, and linguistic distinctions. When we fail to recognize these distinctions and fail to see a group of people as unique individuals, that\u2019s when categorizing becomes problematic. For some South Asians, the identity of \"Asian American\" doesn\u2019t quite fit them as individuals. On the other hand, for other Asians\u2014East and Southeast\u2014perhaps the term \"Asian American\" doesn\u2019t quite fit either. The term was, after all, was borne out of a political movement in the 1960\u2019s to fight stereotypes and racial discrimination. The question I leave you with is: does \"Asian American\" still mean the same thing to us as it did in the 60\u2019s? Or has it taken on an entirely new connotation?\n","html":"<em>Has the meaning of term changed since the 1960s movement?<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>casey tran<\/strong><\/p>\r\nAsian American.\r\n\r\nThe term seems relatively simple: American-born persons of Asian descent. But for many South Asian students on the Berkeley campus, the term is a little more complicated than that.\r\n\r\n\"People tend to think of Asian American as [East Asian]... Filipino or Chinese,\" Amit Kapadia, a second-year, said.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Asian American\" was first coined by activists in the 1960s. Their intent was to create a pan-ethnic community encompassing a variety of different Asian ethnicities that would come together to address issues such as stereotypes and racial discrimination. To a large extent, this goal of stirring political and social activism within the Asian American community was achieved, as demonstrated by the formation of the Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA) in 1968 by Berkeley graduate student Yuji Ichioka. Along with the Third World Liberation Front, the AAPA and other organizations pushed for the formation of an Ethnic Studies program on the Berkeley campus.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the Ethnic Studies program also emerged other disciplines, including South and Southeast Asian Studies. But even before the establishment of the latter, the university already had a history with South Asian discourse. The Center for South Asian Studies (CSAS) was established in 1959, dedicating its study to India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and the Maldives.\r\n\r\nThe term \"South Asian\" has been considered to fall under the larger umbrella of \"Asian American.\" However there is some dispute about this grouping. Borne out of a purpose to include people of diverse backgrounds, the term \"Asian American\" has come to mean different things to different people.\r\n\r\n\"I would to an extent [consider myself Asian American]. But not at Berkeley; there are [many Asian] countries represented here, a large majority of them are East Asian. When people think of Asian American, they think of Chinese. It has to do with the mentality of other people. They tend to group people together as Asian American,\" Astrid Fernandes, a second year, said.

Trying to navigate a brand-new campus with so many damn people all around, we run into the many Sproul-ites trying to lure us with free food. Eventually, another Asian American girl approaches us and hands us a flyer from an Asian American sorority on campus. Having never felt the need to fully explore or analyze our racial identity, it comes as a shock that we feel so intrigued by an all-ethnic, pan-Asian organization. After rushing and pledging, we\u2019re eventually initiated into the \"Asian American interest\" sorority, where we begin to find sisterhood and community. Sure, this exercise is clearly far from a comprehensive representation of the experience of Berkeley\u2019s student population, which varies greatly in age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status; however, its specificity indeed encompasses a significant demographic of the university. Currently, 42% of undergraduate students at UC Berkeley self-identify as Asian American. The history of the exclusion of Asian Americans from the Greek system has led to the rise of all-Asian American organizations. During the last three decades, an influx of Asian American interest sororities occurred in college towns around the country, anywhere there were communities of Asian American students. Now, though, we have begun to see more representation of Asian Americans in formerly white-exclusive sororities, while there are also many disparate Asian American student groups on campus. We, the authors, were wondering if there still are justifications for why Asian American interest sororities should still exist. We spoke with Emily Chang and Tina Lo, two members of Sigma Omicron Pi, and we were able to see that today\u2019s racial politics are still too nuanced to disregard the significance of an all-Asian American sorority. Going back to that 42%, it is true that there is some Asian American representation in traditionally white sororities. However, it is also true that the Panhellenic sororities are still predominantly white. So for Asian Americans in these sororities, there may be an obvious transition from feeling like you are part of a majority in a classroom, to finding yourself a racial minority once you enter your sorority house. According to Chang, \"Asian American women can find a sense of belonging and community within Asian Greek organizations that they might not necessarily find in Panhellenic sororities.\" Asian Americans are often more likely to find common points of interest and relate to issues that are specific to Asian American community with other Asian Americans. An \"Asian American interest sorority\" like Sigma Omicron Pi creates a space for such dialogue to occur. For instance, Asian American women might enjoy discussing a new Korean drama they recently watched. Or, considering how HPV disproportionately affects Asian American communities, an Asian American sorority might consider hosting an HPV campaign event to raise awareness about getting tested. Also, although Asian Americans form a significant portion of the student population at the Berkeley campus, the fact is that this percentage is not representative of the country\u2019s racial breakdown. After entering the \"real world\" where Asians are clearly a minority, Asian American women may have to come to the realization that the Berkeley bubble is now popped. With a national population percentage of 10%, Asian Americans are still marginalized and seen without the disaggregated lens that is so heavily emphasized at Berkeley. The qualifications of a bond, specifically the bonds of sisterhood attributed to sororities, are frequently tied to the existence of commonalities and shared interests or desires. Indeed, considering the history of oppression faced by the Asian American community, it makes sense that there would be a strong desire for a collaborative effort to negate the racism and xenophobia of the early twentieth century. But does an Asian American interest sorority offer more than a sisterhood by helping its members shape their ethnic or racial identity? Or is it simply a sorority modeled after a Panhellenic sorority that happens to have an Asian American majority? Tina Lo of Sigma Omicron Pi said, \"Sisterhood can help form ethnic identity simply because people close to you can influence you, especially those you respect and admire. If you see other confident, strong, and successful Asian women, you will strive to be the same.\" We agree that sisterhood is an important aspect of Asian American interest sororities, but we also believe more can be done to serve the \"Asian American interest.\" Both Chang and Lo said that currently, more emphasis is put on sisterhood than on cultural and historical exploration; we believe the latter should be emphasized as well. Marginalization of Asians may not be as obvious as in the past, especially on the Berkeley campus, but the ongoing underrepresentation of Asian American women both in the Panhellenic sororities as well as in various professional sectors is enough reason for Asian American interest sororities to exist\u2014they create a space where Asian American women can openly discuss and share thoughts on race. And through this process, Asian American interest sororities can offer not only a sisterhood but also an opportunity for their sisters to explore their identity, culture, and history.\n","html":"<em>why asian american sororities are important today<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>kenny gong &amp; sunny kim<\/strong><\/p>\r\nLet\u2019s just imagine for a second that we\u2019re Asian American, freshmen girls at UC Berkeley.

Mr. James is a 43-year-old white man who hails from Ohio and is currently on a tour through Japan. What brings him to Japan, you may ask? Well, persuaded by his inquisitive daughter in pigtails and black rimmed glass (it must be hereditary) to move to the land of the rising sun, Mr. James is on a mission to satisfy his cravings for his favorite hamburgers of his youth (when he himself was a college student in Japan) and spread the mutual love for McDonald\u2019s Nippon All Stars. He may not speak proper Japanese, but he sure knows a thing about a mean hamburger. ...Or so the story goes for McDonald\u2019s marketing campaign in Japan. Nippon All Stars consist of four sandwiches that are currently available as a limited time offer between August and November. Concocted by one of the biggest advertising agencies in the world, Dentsu, Mr. James, with all his \"Anglo-nerdiness\" included, is the official mascot for Nippon All Stars. So far, he\u2019s been featured in five commercials, where he yells \"Tamago (egg)\" instead of \"Tamaya\" during fireworks and professes his love for a chicken sandwich at a geisha. It would seem likely that even without this self-deprecatingly endearing fellow, the hamburgers would have sold well because they are after all \"All Stars,\" and who doesn\u2019t love a Big Mac with an egg in it? The problem of the matter is that Mr. James portrays Caucasians in Japan as \"gai-jin,\" which is a derogatory term for foreigners that implies being distinctly alien and humiliatingly unable to assimilate into normal Japanese society. The Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association (FRANCA) is offended by Mr. James and argues that he embodies a lingering prejudice against whites in Japan. It\u2019s understandable that FRANCA would feel this way because, especially in rural regions of Japan where citizens may have little to no contact with actual Caucasians, Mr. James perpetuates a specific image of white people. Mr. James is a nerdy, fast food loving simpleton who can\u2019t grasp the language and speaks katakana (Japanese alphabet typically reserved for foreign words) all the time. Yet at the same time, Japanese media is often littered with images that put Caucasians on a pedestal, having them speak perfectly articulate Japanese\u2014such images could easily squash the \"negative stereotype\" of Mr. James out of people\u2019s minds. Another particular McDonald\u2019s advertisement features Caucasian models dressed in typical red and yellow Ronald McDonald garb, looking not like fools, but glamorized individuals. There is no doubt that Caucasians are at least viewed with a certain level of novelty, although not always in an overtly \"racist\" manner. So it is no stretch of the imagination that Japanese people are in fact loving Mr. James. Dentsu isn\u2019t one of the top ad agencies for nothing; this marketing campaign is quite meticulously crafted. Mr. James, though fictional, is marketed as a living, breathing person who comes out to your local McDonald\u2019s store for meet n\u2019 greets, and even keeps his own frequently updated blog. The character of Mr. James posts about his travels in Japan and all the nice people he meets who love to give him fan art projects and dress like him with glasses and red shirt in tow. Going through the blog history, his early posts are written in embarrassingly vast amounts of katakana, but his more recent posts seem to possess a more elevated command of Japanese with hiragana and kanji, albeit still in simple diction. Is Dentsu trying to illustrate a gradual improvement in Mr. James\u2019s Japanese due to his immersion in it during his travels? That is some thorough insight right there. I don\u2019t see American advertising campaigns going beyond the one dimensional \"sushi chefs\" dancing around for grilled chicken (I\u2019m looking at you KFC). It may sound like I\u2019m defending McDonald\u2019s marketing strategy, but in actuality I\u2019m not. Although effective, this campaign is a misstep for Japanese McDonald\u2019s, as it does illustrate that there is still a profound amount of political incorrectness in this modern era of globalization (I\u2019m still looking at you KFC). Like when the APA community gets riled up over misrepresentations of Asian peoples in the media, the fury of FRANCA over this particular advertising campaign is not to be taken lightly and dismissed as a group of people just being overly sensitive. In incidences like this, a necessary light is shed on the universal plight of any ethnic identity being profiled as a caricature for the sake of selling something. I realize it is supposedly \"all in good fun,\" but people need to wake up and realize it\u2019s not just \"satirical\" to poke fun at someone\u2019s race. The way I see it, Mr. James is a little more than the two-dimensional \"gai-jin\" that some are accusing him to be. I can\u2019t deny that I do like Mr. James, as the smiley Japanese children featured on his blog seem to genuinely like him. He\u2019s not on the same level as your run-of-the-mill mascot like Ronald McDonald. While Ronald McDonald is iconic, he\u2019s creepy and I wouldn\u2019t even sit on a park bench with a statue of him. Mr. James, on the other hand, makes me want to be his friend and practice Japanese with him because not only is he enthusiastic about other cultures, he looks like he\u2019ll treat you to a Nippon All Star hamburger. Nippon All Stars will end in November, and so likely will Mr. James and his love for McDonald\u2019s hamburgers in Japan.

Like when the APA community gets riled up over misrepresentations of Asian peoples in the media, the fury of FRANCA over this particular advertising campaign is not to be taken lightly and dismissed as a group of people just being overly sensitive. In incidences like this, a necessary light is shed on the universal plight of any ethnic identity being profiled as a caricature for the sake of selling something. I realize it is supposedly \"all in good fun,\" but people need to wake up and realize it\u2019s not just \"satirical\" to poke fun at someone\u2019s race.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, Mr. James is a little more than the two-dimensional \"gai-jin\" that some are accusing him to be. I can\u2019t deny that I do like Mr. James, as the smiley Japanese children featured on his blog seem to genuinely like him. He\u2019s not on the same level as your run-of-the-mill mascot like Ronald McDonald. While Ronald McDonald is iconic, he\u2019s creepy and I wouldn\u2019t even sit on a park bench with a statue of him. Mr. James, on the other hand, makes me want to be his friend and practice Japanese with him because not only is he enthusiastic about other cultures, he looks like he\u2019ll treat you to a Nippon All Star hamburger.\r\n\r\nNippon All Stars will end in November, and so likely will Mr. James and his love for McDonald\u2019s hamburgers in Japan. His brief stint as a quirky mascot came with a little more controversy than they could have bargained for.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":33,"created_at":"Mon, 06 Dec 2010 23:48:35 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 06 Dec 2010 23:48:35 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 06 Dec 2010 23:48:35 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1216,"title":"Breaking Through:","slug":"breaking-through","markdown":"\n*Can Asian music artists capture the American public?*by **cher padua**\n\n Back in the Philippines in elementary school, I was already aware that familiarity with Western pop culture carried a level of bragging rights with my peers. While we admired the successes of our own native actors and musicians, it was much cooler to idolize American artists. This is why many popular Asian entertainers feel they must also gain fame in the United States in order to be truly successful. To many in Asia, America is the land of milk and honey.

South Korean girl group the Wonder Girls has taken the leap in the hopes that they will be welcomed here. Still, they have little going for them.

The Wonder Girls have missed the train by a few years with no indication of when, if ever, it\u2019s coming back. The list of Asian entertainers wanting to make it big in the U.S. goes on. Names like Utada Hikaru and Se7en come to mind, artists who can\u2019t seem to break the American entertainment industry, finding popularity only amongst the Asian and Asian American community. In contrast, American entertainers such as the Backstreet Boys experience a more positive reception from Asian countries regardless of their popularity in their home country. Miles and miles of girls holding placards proclaiming their love for these entertainers whom they know little to nothing about are willing to stay on their feet for hours, as they mouth the words to songs in a language they probably barely understand. Once artists, musicians or actors hit it big in the United States, their chances of being well-known, even loved, in Asia are quite high, quite unlike the fate their Asian counterparts face in America. It is interesting to note however, that this unlucky streak for Asians seems to occur only in the music industry. There are Asians and Asian Americans who have been influential in the Western pop culture from acting to filmmaking. Take for example Yunjin Kim, a Korean actress who is part of the ensemble for ABC\u2019s \"Lost.\" In the hit television series, she plays a Korean woman who on some occasions even speaks fluently in her native language. Most notably, Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki has gained prominence and critical acclaim in the American entertainment industry for his animated films like \"Howl\u2019s Moving Castle\"; he has also won the prestigious Oscar award for Best Animated Feature for \"Spirited Away.\" That being said, it is in the music industry that they still find it hard to establish their niche amongst Western audiences. This may be because the music industry and its audience are fickle. The market bosses cater to artists who are easily marketable or are predicted to be the next big thing; when this venture fails, those artists are quickly dropped. Imports do not have the avenues that new American pop stars such as Taylor Swift had in \"American Idol\" or Miley Cyrus had in the Disney Channel, and therefore rely on their label\u2019s promotion and word of mouth, strategies with no certainty for success. Nevertheless, racial bias still plays a major role in the lack of success of Asian Americans and imports from the East. These artists face an uphill battle in breaking through the forces of xenophobia suffered by the entertainment industry today. When Asians mispronounce an English word, it\u2019s embarrassing. However, when Americans mispronounce a Japanese word, or mess up a phrase in Mandarin, it\u2019s cute and endearing. It is necessary for Asian entertainers to adopt the American way in order for them to even be considered in the industry; even then, there is no guarantee of being successful merely because they look \"different.\" The Wonder Girls are criticized for their accents while Utada, an American-born Japanese singer\/songwriter, found little success in the U.S. despite her fluency and accuracy with the English language and her incredible musical talents.

This is not a criticism of any particular race. It is a mere illustration of the racial bias going on in the world today. The glorification of all things American while other cultures are left in the backburner is as true and as insulting now as it was when I was 10.

Yet American remakes of Asian movies are simply accepted; many Americans aren\u2019t even aware that the movie they watched had its origins in China or Japan.

The not-so-enthused worry of America\u2019s undergoing \"orientalization.\" But why not simply export the Asian movies to America in original form? After all, American films have a large presence in Asia, and Asians watch subtitled or dubbed versions rather than remakes. Is it that remakes are profitable? For instance Martin Scorsese\u2019s \"The Departed\" (2006) grossed $289,847,354 worldwide, an amount that completely eclipses the original \"Infernal Affairs\" (Hong Kong, 2004) which garnered a comparatively modest $8,708,932. Roy Lee, the Korean- American producer who brought movies like \"The Ring\" to America, has even made a business out of the process, his brokering of Asian movies gaining him the title \"king of remakes.\" Given the speculative nature of the film industry, remakes have backfired. Take \"My Sassy Girl,\" a South Korean romantic comedy that has gained popularity all over Asia - but apparently failed to interest American audiences. The remake, which did poorly in test screenings, was relegated to the movie graveyard as a straight-to-DVD release. Roy Lee stated in an interview with the Associated Press that American men rejected the idea of a woman bossing around a man in a romantic relationship. Truth of the matter is, \"My Sassy Girl\" was extremely specific to South Korean culture (love motels and mandatory military service are just a few of the things you wouldn\u2019t find in America today), and simply couldn\u2019t mean the same to Americans. Apparently simply remaking a movie doesn\u2019t guarantee the remaking of success\u2014you have to take cultural differences into account. Indeed there\u2019s a translational quality to these second-generation films despite the fact that they\u2019ve intentionally averted subtitling and dubbing (two things the American public apparently hate). It simply makes sense to replace the samurai of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s \"The Seven Samurai\" (1954) with the cowboy in \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), a figure particularly entrenched in the American idiom. Thus, remakes function as makeovers, giving a facelift to the setting, storyline, and characters. In \"The Ring,\" America\u2019s 2002 rendition of a 1998 Japanese horror film, the setting is changed from Japan to Washington, ostensibly replacing the ethnically-Japanese cast with white Americans. This route seems to be the most typical of Hollywood remakes. A slightly different approach is taken by \"The Grudge\" (a 2004 remake of the 2003 Japanese film\" Ju-on: The Grudge\"). Like \"The Ring,\" the core cast consists of white characters, with Sarah Michelle Geller as the lead. However, the remake is set in Japan. Is \"The Grudge\" more authentic for locating itself in its native Japan? I can\u2019t say, although I do believe that\u2019s what the producers were aiming for. After all, \"The Grudge\" was riding on the coattails of the very successful \"The Ring,\" widely known to have been based on a Japanese film. Locating the movie in Japan makes the ghosts of the movie particularly Japanese\u2014and this Japanese exoticism is set up to contrast a white American point of view. In Laura Mulvey\u2019s essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" (1975), the author suggests that watching a movie allows viewers to temporarily assume the point of view of the main characters of the film. For \"The Grudge,\" the movie\u2019s point of view has become \"Americanified\" by the selection of white actors for the leads. This identification is reinforced through the contrast created by casting ethnically Japanese ghosts. I\u2019d call it pretty racist to locate horror in the \"other.\" This also happens in the 2008 remake of \"Shutter,\" initially a 2004 Thai film. The remake is set in Tokyo (the original was set in New York), with two white leads, Joshua Jackson and Rachel Taylor. The part of the vengeful ghost is played, unsurprisingly, by a Japanese actress (Megumi Okina). Are Asian countries as different as Thailand and Japan so easily conflated? It makes me think of the 2007 Academy Awards, during which \"The Departed\" won for best adapted screenplay. The commentator incorrectly attributed the provenance for the original as Japan rather than Hong Kong. That\u2019s 1,717 miles off the mark.

Authored by Senator Leland Yee, D-San Francisco\/San Mateo, the resolution marks October 18, 1857 as the earliest documented instance of Pilipino presence in the continental United States. Meanwhile, the Filipino American National Historical Society (FAHNS) acknowledges 1763 as the year of the first Pilipino permanent settlement in the United States, with the establishment of the St. Malo Parish community in Louisiana\u2014ascertaining the centuries of pre-colonial presence Pilipinos have had in the country. During the month of October several events will take place to recognize and honor the contributions, legacies, and stories of the Pilipino American community. Established in 1988 by FAHNS, Pilipino American History Month symbolizes the need and importance to promote awareness and understanding of Pilipino Americans in a multicultural American historical narrative. But it is not only the need to contextualize the stories of Pilipino Americans in the larger American history that is important. As Pilipino Americans we must continue to write our own stories and narrative while being critical of our legacies in a political, cultural, and social context. For hundreds of years the history of the Philippines, Pilipinos and Pilipino Americans has literally been written for us. Even today, our community struggles to combat the hegemony of the colonial narrative that has framed our history for centuries. The building which houses the Asian American Studies & Ethnic Studies program, for instance, takes its name from a Philippine imperialist, David Prescott Barrows. Barrows served as the Secretary of Education for the Philippines government\u2014a U.S. colony at the time\u2014and played an instrumental role in writing and framing the history of the Philippines, a narrative which included descriptions of Pilipinos as the \"little brown brother of the Americans.\" It is ironic that the very disciplines that create alternative narratives for Ethnic peoples must be housed within a building named after the man that wrote the original colonial history for the Philippines. As a people, we will always carry that colonial history with us, and we must not forget or deny its existence. But we must also never be complacent and believe that the legacies and consequences of that colonial history are gone. Even today, as Pilipino Americans celebrate the 246th anniversary of Pilipinos settling in America and the 21st anniversary of FAHM, we as a community continue to struggle. It is vital for us to not only recognize the struggles we\u2019ve faced as a community historically, but presently as well. The struggle for full benefits for Pilipino WWII veterans is not over, nor is the struggle to gain adequate protection and recognition of hate crimes committed against people of color. Pilipino American History Month must be a time when we do more than reflect upon the histories of our people and our community. We must be engaged and critical of current policies and politics that continue to adversely affect our community, such as the privatization and exclusion of people of color from public institutions like UC Berkeley. This Pilipino American Heritage Month, I plan to celebrate by becoming engaged with issues that continue to affect our community, and other historically marginalized communities. By simply being critical of the past, and without engaging in current politics, we fail to uphold the legacy that our ancestors forged so bravely with their tired and calloused hands.\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>carlo de la cruz<\/strong><\/p>\r\nOn September 10, 2009, the California legislature announced its unanimous approval of Senate Concurrent Resolution 48, which officially recognizes October as Pilipino American History Month.

Even today, our community struggles to combat the hegemony of the colonial narrative that has framed our history for centuries.\r\n\r\nThe building which houses the Asian American Studies &amp; Ethnic Studies program, for instance, takes its name from a Philippine imperialist, David Prescott Barrows. Barrows served as the Secretary of Education for the Philippines government\u2014a U.S. colony at the time\u2014and played an instrumental role in writing and framing the history of the Philippines, a narrative which included descriptions of Pilipinos as the \"little brown brother of the Americans.\" It is ironic that the very disciplines that create alternative narratives for Ethnic peoples must be housed within a building named after the man that wrote the original colonial history for the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAs a people, we will always carry that colonial history with us, and we must not forget or deny its existence. But we must also never be complacent and believe that the legacies and consequences of that colonial history are gone. Even today, as Pilipino Americans celebrate the 246th anniversary of Pilipinos settling in America and the 21st anniversary of FAHM, we as a community continue to struggle. It is vital for us to not only recognize the struggles we\u2019ve faced as a community historically, but presently as well. The struggle for full benefits for Pilipino WWII veterans is not over, nor is the struggle to gain adequate protection and recognition of hate crimes committed against people of color. Pilipino American History Month must be a time when we do more than reflect upon the histories of our people and our community. We must be engaged and critical of current policies and politics that continue to adversely affect our community, such as the privatization and exclusion of people of color from public institutions like UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThis Pilipino American Heritage Month, I plan to celebrate by becoming engaged with issues that continue to affect our community, and other historically marginalized communities. By simply being critical of the past, and without engaging in current politics, we fail to uphold the legacy that our ancestors forged so bravely with their tired and calloused hands.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":33,"created_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 17:58:31 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 17:58:44 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 17:58:31 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1237,"title":"\"Are You A Fob?\"","slug":"are-you-a-fob","markdown":"\n*How use of the word \"FOB\" marginalizes Asians in the United States*by **sunny kim**\n\n \u201cAre you a FOB?\u201d Oh shit. What did I do this time to make someone ask me that question? Did I pronounce a word with a Korean accent? Is it something I wore? Is it just the way I look? Ever since I came to the United States in second grade, this three letter word has haunted me. When I just started learning English in second grade, I heard this word used often by my classmates, and it was not difficult to sense its derogatory connotation. Even now, I feel a high level of discomfort and insecurity when I am labeled with or even associated with the term. It\u2019s disappointing to me that the usage of the label \u201cFOB\u201d is still considered acceptable, even in a supposedly educated and socially conscious space like Berkeley. Fresh Off the Boat, more commonly abbreviated as FOB, is \u201ca phrase used to describe immigrants that have arrived from a foreign nation and have not yet assimilated to the host nation\u2019s culture, language, and behavior.\u201d1 Most commonly, the \u201cforeign nation\u201d is a nation from Asia and the \u201chost nation\u2019s culture, language, and behavior\u201d is what is considered mainstream American culture, language, and behavior. Personally, I am used to hearing FOB being used to describe international students or recent immigrants from Asia, but rarely have I heard FOB being used to describe an immigrant from a non-Asian country. FOB specifically marginalizes Asian immigrant communities within the larger Asian American population. The label does not embrace the diversity that immigrants bring, but instead subordinates them because of their failure to become a part of what is considered mainstream American culture. Through this process, things that are associated with being Asian become distasteful symbols of foreign origin, illlustrating an anti-Asian sentiment that groups have spent generations combating. My friends make derogatory remarks about my \u201cFobby\u201d Korean pop song playlist on my iTunes. I hear students snicker when a classmate reads aloud with a \u201cFobby\u201d accent. On the other hand, I can see the obvious contrast when anything associated with European is attractively exoticized. A British accent is many times described as \u201chot\u201d or \u201csexy.\u201d European way of dress is often portrayed as \u201csophisticated\u201d and \u201cclassy.\u201d What I find particularly interesting is that it is most often the Asian students who commonly use the word to distinguish themselves from the \u201c F O B s . \u201d Perhaps they subconsciously feel better because they believe that their assimilation puts them in a superior status in comparison to nonassimilated Asian Americans. This leads to another observation, which is that American culture is commonly equated with white culture. This notion indirectly opposes the idea of multiculturalism. The saying that America is a land of immigrants is clich\u00e9 but true. Diversity was created through the entrance of immigrants including Asian immigrants, and this forms the culture that United States prides itself in. Although the immigrant population in the U.S. is increasing, many of these immigrants groups are not accepted as \u201cAmerican.\u201d Immigrants are not accepted, but are excluded as foreigners through the usage of words like FOB. Throughout American history, this same form of exclusion and marginalization has been practiced by the white population against Asian immigrants. Many derogatory terms have been used to label Asians as foreigners. Although this marginalization may seem to be less obvious now, the usage of the word FOB is a way that Asians continue to be marginalized in America, even by other Asians. It is hypocritical to condemn discrimination against Asians but to turn around and use words like FOB, which plays upon the foreign Asian sentiment still prevalent in the U.S. Some may consider this issue as being blown out of proportion, but I have my own personal experiences of being victimized by this word, and I know I am speaking up not only for myself, but for other people who have been, and are still, offended by this label. So next time, before you use any form of the word FOB flippantly, just stop and think about why you\u2019re using it. Check your intentions and think about the effects of the words you choose to use.

Pause and listen to the many different languages and dialects spoken by students on the UC Berkeley campus. Whether it is Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, German, Japanese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Hebrew, Khmer, or Korean, students here are learning to say \u201chello\u201d in many different languages. From the dead language of Latin to the romantic language of French, the university has a diverse course offering. One language, however, has been left out of the picture: Cantonese. Cantonese is a dialect that originates from Southern China. It is primarily spoken in the Guangzhou and Macau provinces and Hong Kong. Within the U.S., Cantonese is heavily spoken in the Chinatowns of San Francisco and New York. Both Cantonese and Mandarin share the same written characters; however, the pronunciations for the languages differ to the point where a Cantonese speaker cannot understand Mandarin. According to Maricela Chan-Liang, one of the Intermediate Cantonese DeCal instructors, most of mainland China speaks Mandarin rather than Cantonese. \u201cCantonese is more of a dialect within China. A lot of people speak Cantonese in Hong Kong and the south part of China, but then for the rest of China, it\u2019s all Mandarin,\u201d Chan-Liang said. The widespread use of Mandarin has spread to other parts of Asia such as Singapore and Malaysia. The Chinese government has declared that Mandarin is the official language of the country despite the many other dialects in the country. As a result, the government has the tendency to overlook the other dialects and instead promote Mandarin. Most of China\u2019s media such as CCTV and People\u2019s Daily are Mandarin-based. China\u2019s education system also marginalizes the Cantonese language in favor of Mandarin, a fact reaffirmed by Chan-Liang\u2019s experience in Hong Kong. When she studied in Hong Kong, she could not write in her native tongue. \u201cCantonese is not an official language. When you write it down, it\u2019s considered slang. Like in Hong Kong, when I studied there, for Chinese essay that you have to write for composition, [you would write down how you would] say it in Mandarin. You cannot write what you actually say in Cantonese as an official, formal language,\u201d Chan-Liang said. How sad is it that the majority of students studying in Hong Kong are taught that their native tongue is slang? How sad is it that these students are taught that the language that their ancestors spoke and passed down through generations is considered illegitimate? Governments and institutions make languages illegitimate. Languages and dialects that have been spoken by people for centuries don\u2019t become illegitimate without institutional policy or violence. Cantonese is an example of a language that has been suppressed by institutional practices. The Chinese government has set up an education system in Hong Kong that teaches its youth that their native tongue is illegitimate and that Mandarin is the superior language. This perception of Mandarin as the superior language over Cantonese can be seen in our American schools and universities. A recent New York Times article reported that in the New York Chinese School, the number of Mandarin classes outnumbered Cantonese classes by three to one. A community that was once primarily Cantonese is slowly turning Mandarin. Which leads to the question: is Cantonese a dying language? The East Asian Languages and Cultures Department at Berkeley offers Mandarin, but not Cantonese. This may be because of the perceived universal advantages of Mandarin over Cantonese. Chan-Liang speculates that perhaps there is an emphasis placed on Mandarin within the university because it is one of the top three universal languages along with English and Spanish. Students who learn Mandarin can go overseas to China or elsewhere in Asia and communicate effectively for business other professions. However, who says that students who learn Cantonese can\u2019t put those language skills to use? Hong Kong is a major industrial city where Cantonese is mostly spoken. Who says that Cantonese speakers can\u2019t do business there? In the Bay Area, there is a larger population of Cantonese than Mandarin speakers. Go into Chinatown Oakland or San Francisco and it is more likely that you\u2019ll hear Cantonese over Mandarin. Who says that students who learn Cantonese can\u2019t go into those communities and do non-profit work? Who says that students can\u2019t write for those communities? Or open up medical firms that would be geared toward those Cantonesespeaking communities? Learning Cantonese is just as beneficial as Mandarin. Mandarin may provide more opportunities for students looking to go overseas given the 850 million speakers in the world. However, the 70 million Cantonese speakers in the world should not be overlooked either. Both languages provide local and international opportunities. At a university that prides itself on diversity and its academics, Berkeley should embrace all the languages and dialects of the world and not shut out certain languages that are perceived to be non-beneficial to the future endeavors of students. Students should be able to learn a language just to learn. The university is here for the student to learn everything and anything. And by learning everything and anything, the student should be able to decide what he or she is passionate about and pursue that subject. By shutting out certain languages, the university is taking away opportunities from the student. It also means a loss of connection to personal history and culture for many students. Chan-Liang affirms this sentiment. \u201cIt\u2019s good that they would know Mandarin, but that means that the younger generations wouldn\u2019t know Cantonese, which is bad,\u201d Chan- Liang said. The Chinese government has decided that Cantonese is inferior to Mandarin. It has labeled Cantonese as informal and slang. Since when does Berkeley simply accept a government\u2019s decisions without critically thinking about them? What were the Chinese government\u2019s motivations in marginalizing Cantonese and its speakers? Is it right to marginalize a language that has been spoken by people for centuries and currently has millions of speakers worldwide? No, it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t right to marginalize Cantonese given its potential opportunities for students and its rich history. In the past, Berkeley has made controversial and progressive decisions about its academics such as the establishment of the Ethnic Studies program in 1969. The university should continue to challenge the conventions of academics and pioneer new areas to be explored. Why can\u2019t we have both Cantonese and Mandarin? Why are we forced to choose only one? Cantonese may be a difficult language to teach given that it is not standardized and does not have its own writing system, but we are Berkeley after all. And at Berkeley, we don\u2019t let the difficulty of a challenge stop us from trying to find a solution. The consistent popularity of the Cantonese DeCal on campus is evidence of students\u2019 desire to maintain a connection to their history and culture. It is also evidence of students\u2019 continuing interest in the Cantonese language. Cantonese is not obsolete or dying. Given the 70 million speakers worldwide and the large concentration of Cantonese speakers in the Bay Area, it is still thriving, but we need to continue to fight for its inclusion in universities.

Fuji, has become infamous as a favorite suicide spot after mystery writer Seichi Matsumoto described the woodland as ideal for the perfect death. In 1998 alone, the bodies of about 70 people were found in the notorious forest. Today, according to the World Health Organization, Japan\u2019s suicide rate is about 51 per 100,000 people. This is more than twice the rate in the United States (22 per 100,000). This unnaturally high incidence of suicide is occurring not only in Japan but also in many other East Asian communities around the world as well. Why is the incidence of suicide significantly greater among these Asian demographics than the rest of the world? The answer may lie in family. Family is the double-edged sword of the Far East: It is the secret to discipline, obedience, and hard work while at the same time it represents the manifestation of ancestral pride, strict expectations, and intolerance for deviation from traditional values. Family is equally a space for familiarity and comfort as it is for social conditioning and stress. Within the family, taboo topics such as suicide consequently garner a sense of shame, stigma and isolation. Through the vehicle of strict, harsh, or nagging parents, the guilty conscience of not living up to parental expectations is only the tip of the iceberg that is a much greater psychological behemoth. In many traditional Asian cultures, social-cultural dogmas embody a tacit understanding of individual respect and failure as a reflection of the family unit; these unforgiving mentalities are prone to overwhelming the life of an overstressed, depressed individual who may be considering suicide. While these cultural beliefs and worldviews have been sustained through generations, how do these forces continue to shape the lives of Asians today? In Japan, economic downturns have been a catalyst instigating a surge in suicides amongst working men and women. It is no accident that the highest spikes in suicide occur in March, the end of the fiscal year. Signs from the recently launched government campaign informing the public about depression and suicide are beginning to pop up in train cars and stations.1 The reason is because the railway system has been the most popular venue for the growing number of suicides \u2013 usually claiming victims on their way to or from work. When financial markers validate family honor and individual worth, how could one possibly save face in the instance of economic tumult? In China, it is the rural landscape that has sustained the worst of what could be considered a national suicide epidemic. The turbulent political and economic landscape, combined with the rapid mutation of what was once a longstanding ancient culture, has resulted in a population of rural peasants and farmers struggling to find a new niche. China is the only country where suicides among women outnumber men. The rural female population, which has endured physical, verbal abuse since the beginning of time, has begun to take their own lives at an alarming rate. The violence towards women in this society is a brutal reflection of long-standing family hierarchies, gender oppression and a refusal to deviate from old traditional values even in the face of an increasingly modern and secular society. It may seem impossible to attempt to translate such statistics to Asians Americans living in the U.S.; however, similar family tensions often plague Asian Americans in the U.S. According to a new study by UC Davis, Asian Americans whose families experience a high degree of interpersonal conflict have a three-fold greater risk of attempting suicide when compared with Asian Americans overall. Currently, the most problematic issue relating to family dynamics among Asian Americans is the relationship between Asian American children and their parents. In America, Asian American children often feel the pressure from their parents when it comes to success in the classroom. When they deviate from the expected career paths of doctor, lawyer or engineer, they are often met with both disapproval and disappointment from their families. Family tensions such as this are possibly a major factor behind suicides among Asian Americans. Asian Americans, however, are not only affected by tense family relations; they must endure additional challenges unique to the Asian American experience. These include culture shock and both intentional and unintentional structural violence, which are the leading factors contributing toward high incidence and low treatment rates for suicide, depression and mental illness among Asian immigrants and Asian Americans in the U.S. One example of unintentional structural violence stems from recurring problems with language barriers. A recent Surgeon General\u2019s Report found that nearly one out of two Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) will have difficulty accessing mental health treatment because of language barriers. Studies in the past suggest that language-based discrimination heavily influences patterns of mental health service use among Chinese Americans. At the same time, these language barriers also work to isolate immigrants from participating in mainstream American society \u2013 a marginalization that often leads to depression. Another example of structural violence includes the unequal access to healthcare faced by Asian American immigrants. About 21 percent of AAPIs live without health insurance, compared to 16 percent of all Americans. It has also been suggested that AAPI\u2019s lower Medicaid participation rates are linked to widespread but mistaken concerns among immigrants that applying for Medicaid jeopardizes possibility for citizenship. Moreover, illegal immigrants are specifically targeted by state procedures which make it extremely difficult for them to access healthcare, in order to discourage illegal immigration. The combination of these two barriers to healthcare has resulted in AAPIs\u2019 extremely low utilization of healthcare services relative to other U.S. populations. For example, in the CAPES study (Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiological Study), only 17 percent of those experiencing psychological problems sought mental healthcare. Shame and stigma are the underlying factors that deter open dialogue and socially acceptable confrontation of depression and mental illness in many Asian and Asian American families. As a result, society too often turns a cold shoulder to those in need of support. In America, when this is compounded with the institutional failings that specifically handicap Asian Americans, it is no surprise that the suicide rates among AAPIs are increasing. But where shall we start? The daunting task of breaking down cultural mindsets? Or should we turn to the power of the state bureaucracy to fumble the issue? The solution may not be a simple one. Let me propose a new initiative, one of awareness and without excuse \u2013 I challenge you to not only address the pressures in your own life, both due to familial relations and not, but to extend a new and genuine, conscious compassion towards those who float in and out of your life as an Asian American. Maybe then we can properly address this issue of cultural difference and indifference here in America, as well as back home in the East.\n","html":"<em>\u00a0Addressing The Psychological Weight Of The Familial Mentality<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by<strong> alex wong<\/strong><\/p>\r\nAokigahara Forest, the 2,400 hectare dense forest at the foot of Mt. Fuji, has become infamous as a favorite suicide spot after mystery writer Seichi Matsumoto described the woodland as ideal for the perfect death. In 1998 alone, the bodies of about 70 people were found in the notorious forest. Today, according to the World Health Organization, Japan\u2019s suicide rate is about 51 per 100,000 people. This is more than twice the rate in the United States (22 per 100,000).\r\n\r\nThis unnaturally high incidence of suicide is occurring not only in Japan but also in many other East Asian communities around the world as well. Why is the incidence of suicide significantly greater among these Asian demographics than the rest of the world?\r\n\r\nThe answer may lie in family. Family is the double-edged sword of the Far East: It is the secret to discipline, obedience, and hard work while at the same time it represents the manifestation of ancestral pride, strict expectations, and intolerance for deviation from traditional values. Family is equally a space for familiarity and comfort as it is for social conditioning and stress.\r\n\r\nWithin the family, taboo topics such as suicide consequently garner a sense of shame, stigma and isolation. Through the vehicle of strict, harsh, or nagging parents, the guilty conscience of not living up to parental expectations is only the tip of the iceberg that is a much greater psychological behemoth. In many traditional Asian cultures, social-cultural dogmas embody a tacit understanding of individual respect and failure as a\r\nreflection of the family unit; these unforgiving mentalities are prone to overwhelming the life of an overstressed, depressed individual who may be considering suicide.\r\n\r\nWhile these cultural beliefs and worldviews have been sustained through generations, how do these forces continue to shape the lives of Asians today?\r\n\r\nIn Japan, economic downturns have been a catalyst instigating a surge in suicides amongst working men and women. It is no accident that the highest spikes in suicide occur in March, the end of the fiscal year. Signs from the recently launched government campaign informing the public about depression and suicide are beginning to pop up in train cars and stations.1 The reason is because the railway system has been the most popular venue for the growing number of suicides \u2013 usually claiming victims on their way to or from work. When financial markers validate family honor and individual worth, how could one possibly save face in the instance of economic tumult?\r\n\r\nIn China, it is the rural landscape that has sustained the worst of what could be considered a national suicide epidemic. The turbulent political and\r\neconomic landscape, combined with the rapid mutation of what was once a longstanding ancient culture, has resulted in a population of rural peasants and farmers struggling to find a new niche. China is the only country where suicides among women outnumber men. The rural female population, which has endured physical, verbal abuse since the beginning of time, has begun to\r\ntake their own lives at an alarming rate. The violence towards women in this society is a brutal reflection of long-standing family hierarchies, gender oppression and a refusal to deviate from old traditional values even in the face of an increasingly modern and secular society.\r\n\r\nIt may seem impossible to attempt to translate such statistics to Asians Americans living in the U.S.; however, similar family tensions often plague Asian Americans in the U.S. According to a new study by UC Davis, Asian Americans whose families experience a high degree of interpersonal conflict have a three-fold greater risk of attempting suicide when compared with\r\nAsian Americans overall.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the most problematic issue relating to family dynamics among Asian Americans is the relationship between Asian American children and their parents. In America, Asian American children often feel the pressure from their parents when it comes to success in the classroom. When they deviate from the expected career paths of doctor, lawyer or engineer, they are often met with both disapproval and disappointment from their families. Family tensions such as this are possibly a major factor behind suicides among Asian Americans.\r\n\r\nAsian Americans, however, are not only affected by tense family relations; they must endure additional challenges unique to the Asian American experience. These include culture shock and both intentional and unintentional structural violence, which are the leading factors contributing toward high incidence and low treatment rates for suicide, depression and mental illness among Asian immigrants and Asian Americans in the U.S.\r\n\r\nOne example of unintentional structural violence stems from recurring problems with language barriers.

Even if you\u2019ve never watched a single episode of the TV series \u201cHeroes,\u201d you\u2019re likely to remember the face of Masi Oka, the Japanese-American actor who plays the superhuman time traveler Hiro Nakamura. The fact that Oka, an Asian American actor, has a prominent role in a prime time NBC drama may have grabbed the public\u2019s attention and curiosity. However, it\u2019s more likely that his character\u2019s amusing, constipated facial expression \u2013 which he scrunches into every time he uses his powers \u2013 is the lasting image that stops time for the majority of the small screen audience. As recent as five years ago, if you were asked to make a list of Asian American actors and actresses in prime time television, your face would probably scrunch up too. That\u2019s because major roles, beyond the usual fare of karate masters and math geeks, were simply not written up or available for the Asian demographic. When compared to the rapid evolution of Asian Americans in American society, this dearth of diversity seems like time travel into a clich\u00e9d and stereotypical past of an immigrant peoples who have clearly changed a great deal over the years. But there\u2019s a noticeable transformation, a la Optimus Prime, going on in that department. Tune in on any popular show, and you\u2019ll see that Asian Americans are making deep strides in the industry. A galvanized crop of actors and actresses with serious talent are coming to the rescue of audiences across the nation. Television shows, ranging from \u201cGlee\u201d to \u201cLost,\u201d are finally responding to the burgeoning proliferation of Asian American talent, and new, endearing roles for Asians are springing up all across the networks. Heroes and heroines of all variants are gradually acquiring a yellow pigment. Naturally, this isn\u2019t limited to the Yellow Power Ranger. As with all superheroes, unfortunately, this Asian American wave has to go through a phase of scrutiny and analysis from the general public before being truly accepted. Do these actors and actresses represent a real change that is here to stay, or are they merely a fleeting interest of the TV-watching public? Do they even represent a change at all? Or do they subtly serve to reinforce the stereotypes that have continually plagued the Asian American demographic? It may be useful to cut beneath the surface and analyze the subliminal messages that are conveyed to the audience by these new characters. \u201cGlee\u201d is a good place to start. With its first episode airing this September, this musical comedy-drama is steadily increasing in popularity, though its critical reception has been mixed. Exhibit A is the character of Tina Cohen-Chang, played by Jenna Ushkowitz, an actress and singer originally from Seoul, Korea. The show\u2019s producers clearly intend to portray Tina as being a \u201cgoth,\u201d as can be seen through her dark makeup and attire. Additionally, Tina is a shy character, exemplified by her stuttering speech. The fact that she has a speech impediment is a trait that I would like to analyze. What are the implications of having the primary Asian American on the show struggle to communicate her thoughts? The average viewer may have the misconception that Asian-Americans, while talented, are innately mute, bound and gagged by the strict social constructs of our heritage. In other words, Tina\u2019s stuttering may function as an extension of the difficulty that some Asian Americans have explaining their thoughts to their peers, parents, or even themselves. This difficulty, which conflicts somewhat with her portrayal as an abrasive and outspoken \u201cgoth,\u201d might arise from a language barrier for some Asians, but for most it probably stems from cultural norms that value the greater good of the community over the expression of individual interests. In this way, Tina Cohen-Chang\u2019s desire to sing may represent the desire for Asian Americans to make themselves heard in other ways, through a musical instrument, a sport, proficiency in a certain academic field, or a hobby. However, the common view is still that we are a shy people who cannot or will not explicitly communicate what is on our minds, for the purposes of subservience and conformity. The fact that Tina does not stutter when she sings reinforces this perception of artistic Asians in general. Asian-Americans as a whole clearly excel in creative and artistic pursuits, and have much to say and contribute to the American artistic community, whether as a demographic they are accurately represented in the media or not. Tina\u2019s character, as one of the most skilled singers in the group, affirms this undeniable fact, but in a way that may still work to subliminally criticize Asian-Americans who seek success in the arts. This is because her stuttering implies that such individuals will still find it difficult to overcome the Asian- American \u201cgag complex\u201d that impede speech and self-expression. In doing so, it suggests that self-censorship is the issue, and that Asians simply choose not to speak up since it is not considered an important or useful endeavour. The character\u2019s tendency to conform can also be seen in the episode \u201cPreggers,\u201d when Tina is awarded the solo song \u201cTonight\u201d for the musical \u201cWest Side Story\u201d from the Glee Club. The character Rachel Berry, an assertive and ambitious Jewish singer, wants the solo instead; Tina is willing to switch parts to appease her, but the director of the Glee Club does not allow this switch. Rachel decides to quit as a result. This storyline asserts the view that Asian Americans are willing to give way and sacrifice potential fame and recognition if they feel that doing so will satisfy a dominant friend or a peer, who in many cases is Caucasian. This episode may serve as an allegory to the state of Asian-Americans in film and television as a whole, supporting the idea that we are fundamentally at fault for our lack of representation in these mediums due to our lack of assertiveness and self-confidence. Whether this is true or not is itself a matter of debate, but I would argue that \u201cGlee\u201d sends a clear message; if the solo part goes to an Asian American, we are more than happy to give it up for the sake of a rival. Another television show that hit the small screen this September was the ABC science fiction drama \u201cFlashforward.\u201d This series features Berkeley\u2019s own John Cho, of \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d fame, who graduated with an English degree from Cal before establishing a career as an actor. Cho plays an FBI special agent, Demetri Noh, who must race against time to unravel the mystery of the flash forward prophecies before they ultimately kill him. This character possesses many positive traits which break down biases regarding Asian Americans. Demetri Noh is engaged to Zoey Andata, an African American portrayed by actress Gabrielle Union. The image of the Asian American male as being effeminate and meek, wholly undesirable to women of other races, is clearly refuted. Demitri Noh is an FBI agent, the real-life equivalent of a superhero. Gabrielle Union, a high profile black actress who is rumored to be dating NBA star Dwayne Wade, is a sex symbol, and the fact that she is Cho\u2019s fianc\u00e9e in the show opposes the view that Asian males cannot possibly be attractive beyond \u201cyellow fever. This interracial relationship also refutes the notion that Asian Americans only pair up with other Asians. There are lingering aspects of subordination that affect Cho\u2019s character, however. Despite the fact that Noh is partners with Mark Benford, another FBI agent, it is Benford who is credited as being the main character of the show, though Noh and Benford work together to solve the crisis. Benford receives more exposure and backstory, while Noh is a sidekick. But the fact remains that Cho is arguably the second most prominent actor on the show, which is a dramatic improvement over previous shows. He is often at the heart of the action, but not in a way that is clich\u00e9d, such as the nerdy techie or the kung fu specialist; he is a special agent, and is realistically trained as such. John Cho manages to transcend his typecast label as an Asian American actor in ways that the geeky Masi Oka could not. Though both are essentially \u201csuperheroes,\u201d Cho could be replaced by an actor of any race. In this way I applaud the show\u2019s creators \u2013 as well as the creators of all television shows that portray Asian Americans in an unbiased light \u2013 and cheer on John Cho as he fights for his life with Gabrielle Union by his side. You could even say that, as opposed to stopping time, Cho is a flash of the future.\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>justin ko<\/strong><\/p>\r\nStop.\r\nEven if you\u2019ve never watched a single episode of the TV series \u201cHeroes,\u201d you\u2019re likely to remember the face of Masi Oka, the Japanese-American actor who plays the superhuman time traveler Hiro Nakamura.

While these concepts are embedded in our national anthem, they exist in reality as oxymorons. Judging from the cautionary notes on Styrofoam cups, America likes to play it safe. And anyone who has taken an economics course knows that there is no such thing as free lunch. Perhaps it\u2019s more congruent to say that the American people are brave and free, especially in regards to California\u2019s state health officials and Asian American business owners. Brave to create a law over the refrigeration of Asian noodles and free to react accordingly to it. According to the Los Angeles Times, there is a new federal law that requires manufacturers to refrigerate fresh rice noodles, which clashes against the tradition of storing them at room temperature. This attracted the attention of California Senator Leland Yee (D-San Francisco) when a San Francisco noodle factory was recently cited by health officials for violating a law that mandates food be stored at either under 41o Fahrenheit or above 140o where microbial growth is stunted. Not only have jobs been lost over this issue, sparks have been flying. State health officials say that the refrigeration of food is a public health measure whereas Asian American business owners say that the law is a violation of traditional practices. And so, Yee and a group of noodle manufacturers are joining forces in hopes of changing the law. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, both parties have legit arguments. Not too long ago, there was a salmonella outbreak in tomato crops and E. coli outbreak in spinach. Taking precautionary measures to prevent detrimental health consequences is reasonable. However, this noodle law can be seen as \u201cred tapism\u201d and just represents another aspect of how un-free and inflexible America really is. Red tape refers to excessive regulation that is considered redundant or bureaucratic and hinders action. As there have not been any reported illnesses from consuming fresh noodles stored at room temperature, it seems unnecessary to suddenly bring up regulations on how they\u2019re manufactured. This law also seems to veer away from the original intent to screen potentially harmful food preparation practices. On the other hand, the Asian American business owners also have a point. Food is an accessible way to teach others about a particular group\u2019s culture and tradition. How else to represent Southeast Asian cuisine than through noodles? Noodle factory owner Tom Thong says that rice noodles have been prepared at room temperature and eaten for thousands of years. Once refrigerated, the noodles become ruined \u2013 hard and brittle. They\u2019re like baguettes or fresh bread \u2013 you just don\u2019t put them in the fridge. Thong claims that health inspectors \u201cdon\u2019t understand our culture.\u201d This is a bold statement because the reverse could also be true \u2013 he may not understand that refrigerating foods is part of the \u201cAmerican culture.\u201d Moreover, in Australia, eggs are found on shelves in aisles; in Greece, milk is also found on the shelf; in many countries, fruit and vegetables are left out of refrigerators. Likewise, many Asian confections are also meant to be stored at room temperature like mocha (sticky rice balls) and moon cakes (made out of lotus paste). The rest of the world is not reaming with gastrointestinal issues. They just have a concept of freshness that we lack. Nowhere else is the obesity epidemic or diabetes rate as high as in America. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. obesity rate has been rising annually and currently, about 30 percent of Californian adults are considered obese. This increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiova-scular disease. One of the main contributing factors to this is the use of high fructose corn syrup in foods. High-fructose corn syrup is not only a cheap sweetener but also a preservative found in nearly all the packaged foods lining the shelves of American supermarkets. Rather than eating fresh foods due to potential microbial growth, Americans prefer eating synthetic foods that are supposedly safe to eat even after a year of being produced. Instead of blindly setting regulations on the refrigeration of food, the California Department of Public Health should embrace cultural practices like making fresh noodles and storing them as is. It should be time that health officials open their eyes to their culture of hypersensitivity to sanity and health. Refrigeration is a recent phenomenon. For thousands of years, mankind has been consuming food between the 410 and 141o range. And we are still alive and well. Cultural practices still persist despite the development of new technologies because they are efficient and safe. Asian American or not, we have all fallen victim to American cultural practices of eating and preparing foods out of boxes rather than whole foods. If health is the main concern over this noodle refrigeration law, then the California Department of Public Health is missing the point.

While these concepts are embedded in our national anthem, they exist in reality as oxymorons. Judging from the cautionary notes on Styrofoam cups, America likes to play it safe. And anyone who has taken an economics course knows that there is no such thing as free lunch. Perhaps it\u2019s more congruent to say that the American people are brave and free, especially in regards to California\u2019s state health officials and Asian American business owners. Brave to create a law over the refrigeration of Asian noodles and free to react accordingly to it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, there is a new federal law that requires manufacturers to refrigerate fresh rice noodles, which clashes against the tradition of storing them at room temperature. This attracted the attention of California Senator Leland Yee (D-San Francisco) when a San Francisco noodle factory was recently cited by health officials for violating a law that mandates food be stored at either under 41o Fahrenheit or above 140o where microbial growth is stunted.\r\n\r\nNot only have jobs been lost over this issue, sparks have been flying. State health officials say that the refrigeration of food is a public health measure whereas Asian American business owners say that the law is a violation of traditional practices. And so, Yee and a group of noodle manufacturers\r\nare joining forces in hopes of changing the law. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, both parties have legit arguments. Not too long ago, there was a salmonella outbreak in tomato crops and E. coli outbreak in spinach.\r\nTaking precautionary measures to prevent detrimental health consequences is reasonable.\r\n\r\nHowever, this noodle law can be seen as \u201cred tapism\u201d and just represents another aspect of how un-free and inflexible America really is. Red tape refers to excessive regulation that is considered redundant or bureaucratic and hinders action. As there have not been any reported illnesses from consuming fresh noodles stored at room temperature, it seems unnecessary to suddenly bring up regulations on how they\u2019re manufactured. This law also seems to veer away from the original intent to screen potentially harmful food preparation practices.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Asian American business owners also have a point. Food is an accessible way to teach others about a particular group\u2019s culture and tradition. How else to represent Southeast Asian cuisine than through\r\nnoodles? Noodle factory owner Tom Thong says that rice noodles have been prepared at room temperature and eaten for thousands of years. Once refrigerated, the noodles become ruined \u2013 hard and brittle. They\u2019re like baguettes or fresh bread \u2013 you just don\u2019t put them in the fridge.\r\n\r\nThong claims that health inspectors \u201cdon\u2019t understand our culture.\u201d This is a bold statement because the reverse could also be true \u2013 he may not understand that refrigerating foods is part of the \u201cAmerican culture.\u201d Moreover, in Australia, eggs are found on shelves in aisles; in Greece, milk is also found on the shelf; in many countries, fruit and vegetables are left out of refrigerators. Likewise, many Asian confections are also meant to be stored at room temperature like mocha (sticky rice balls) and moon cakes (made out of lotus paste). The rest of the world is not reaming with gastrointestinal issues. They just have a concept of freshness that we lack.\r\n\r\nNowhere else is the obesity epidemic or diabetes rate as high as in America. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. obesity rate has been rising annually and currently, about 30 percent of Californian adults are considered obese. This increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiova-scular disease. One of the main contributing factors to this is the use of high fructose corn syrup in foods. High-fructose corn syrup is not only a cheap sweetener but also a preservative found in nearly all the packaged foods lining the shelves of American supermarkets. Rather than eating fresh foods due to potential microbial growth, Americans prefer eating synthetic foods that are supposedly safe to eat even after a year of being produced. Instead of blindly setting regulations on the refrigeration of food, the California Department of Public Health should embrace cultural practices like making fresh noodles and storing them as is. It should be time that health officials open their eyes to their culture of hypersensitivity to sanity and health.\r\n\r\nRefrigeration is a recent phenomenon. For thousands of years, mankind has been consuming food between the 410 and 141o range. And we are still alive and well. Cultural practices still persist despite the development of new technologies because they are efficient and safe. Asian American or not, we have all fallen victim to American cultural practices of eating and preparing foods out of boxes rather than whole foods. If health is the main concern over this noodle refrigeration law, then the California Department of Public Health is missing the point. The use of preservatives and promotion of refrigeration is more harmful than room temperature noodles. The hyper-sensitivity to food safety created practices cancel out ideals of freshness and perpetuate unhealthful food choices. Rather than tangling themselves in this noodle issue, I think it\u2019s time for health officials to realize that in living in the land of the free and home of the brave, they need to try new things and not be afraid to admit their mistakes.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":33,"created_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 20:42:43 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 20:42:43 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 20:42:43 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1258,"title":"My Milk Toof","slug":"my-milk-toof","markdown":"\n*A fantasy world where your teef have a mind of their own*by **rachel lee**\n\n Inhae Lee is the 32-year-old Berkeley resident mastermind behind a blog titled My Milk Toof that is rapidly gaining popularity in the blog world among young kids and college students alike. hardboiled got a chance to ask her about her blog\u2019s growing popularity and the inspiration behind giving miniature sized teeth models a chance in the spotlight. An immigrant from South Korea at age 16, Lee says her Korean-American background is the spark behind her interest in \u201cMilk Teef.\u201d hb: Where does your inspiration come for the storylines? Inhae: The story of ickle getting his baby tooth pulled out was actually [my niece] Chloe\u2019s story. And the story of the \u201cSweet Wilting Tree\u201d was actually something that happened to me. So creating these stories allows me to backtrace a lot to my own childhood. Sometimes I go through my own childhood diary for inspiration. And I grew up reading \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic books, which offer really good philosophies. My boyfriend also inspires me and brings out the naive, childlike side in me. hb:How did your parents feel about you pursuing a career in art? Inhae: My mom let me do whatever I wanted. But like other parents she wanted security for me and a career. She saw me suffer during college while I was lost, but I think everyone goes through that time during their life in one form or another. But my mom knows I\u2019m happy [now]; she understands and she\u2019s supportive. She keeps up with my blog every now and then. She doesn\u2019t know too much English, so sometimes she doesn\u2019t understand the descriptive lines under the pictures. So she\u2019ll call and ask me to explain. It\u2019s nice because even though we\u2019re not the same age group we can talk about this together. Sometimes I\u2019ll ask her for feedback \u2013 sometimes you just need the advice and opinion of someone who\u2019s not an artist but just an average reader. hb: What is a milk toof? Inhae: I came from Korea when I was 16 years old, and I am 32 years old now, so I\u2019ve lived an equal amount in both countries. Now, I am an outsider from Korea but am not fully American either so I have somewhat of an odd identity. I still have to ask some questions that others take for granted. For example, I had to ask, \u201cWhy do they call it a \u2018cup of joe\u2019?\u201d You can say there were lots of Wikipedia searches. That\u2019s why when I first heard the term \u201cmilk tooth,\u201d I got my inspiration for this blog. While I was Wikipedia-searching for \u201cmilk tooth,\u201d I learned that when a baby tooth is reflected by light it\u2019s the color of milk. Then I decided to think about more \u201cbaby terms,\u201d \u2013 basically, the way babies would say certain words. That\u2019s why ickle is \u201cickle\u201d; I imagined the way babies say \u201clittle.\u201d And Lardee is named Lardee because he looks like a piece of lard, doesn\u2019t he? I guess not being fluent in either Korean or English made me inquisitive. hb: Where do you get your inspiration for your characters, ickle and Lardee? Inhae: ickle and Lardee are based on my two nieces. Because my nieces Jamie and Chloe know they\u2019re the inspiration behind my characters, sometimes they ask to be placed and featured in certain ways. It\u2019s really cute. ickle is based on Jamie, the older one who\u2019s 10 now. That\u2019s why he was my first character. He\u2019s the responsible older one; my sister actually battled with cancer which in turn made Jamie really independent, especially since he has a sister who\u2019s seven years younger. Chloe, my younger niece, was my inspiration for Lardee. Lardee\u2019s main facial expression is actually exactly what one of Chloe\u2019s facial expressions looks like. hb: What is your audience demographic like, and does that influence your storyline at all? Inhae: My Facebook fan page actually conveniently breaks down the demographics by country. My top three countries are the U.S., Singapore, and then the Philippines. After that it\u2019s the UK, Sweden, and Norway. Somehow this [website] has gotten the spotlight; pop art is well known in Japan but not so much from Koreans or Americans. In terms of age, the age range goes from 18 to 25, and around 75% of fans are female. I actually have a lot of mom fans. Lots of moms send me fan mail of pictures their kids have drawn of ickle and Lardee, and it\u2019s really sweet. Some moms tell me about how they read my blog with their kids as their bed time story. They tell me they can\u2019t wait for the book to come out so they can go to the bedroom with a book instead of a laptop. hb:What does the future of My Milk Toof look like? Inhae: There are lots of opportunities coming up; I\u2019m trying to be patient about it. There\u2019s a Russian\/Japanese\/Korean company that makes stop motion movies that I\u2019m in contact with. It\u2019s a very interesting prospect, the idea of making this into a stop motion film. But I don\u2019t want to drop the quality of my stories or the models so I\u2019m taking my time. I never wanted to think of this blog as something that would make lots and lots of profit at the cost of the quality of the work. I was inspired by Bill Watterson, the creator of Calvin & Hobbes; he never capitalized on his characters or his story by making dolls because he believed that once you put them on a mock-up it\u2019s not quite the same anymore. But at the same time, it\u2019s hard not to think about because that is how you make the most profit. So now I\u2019m trying to take my time and not sign any contracts too hastily. I would like to see a stop motion movie come out of this though.\n","html":"<em>A fantasy world where your teef have a mind of their own<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>rachel lee<\/strong><\/p>\r\nInhae Lee is the 32-year-old Berkeley resident mastermind behind a blog titled My Milk Toof that is rapidly gaining popularity in the blog world among young kids and college students alike. hardboiled got a chance to ask her about her blog\u2019s growing popularity and the inspiration behind giving miniature sized teeth models a chance in the spotlight.

It is so prevalent in our culture that its implementation isn\u2019t questioned or really even acknowledged for that matter. Just because it is so commonplace, though, does that mean there is no room for change? A group of anonymous socially conscious artists concerned about the recently closed \u201cLords of the Samurai\u201d exhibit (June 12th-September 20th) at the AAMSF didn\u2019t think so. The group launched an artistic intervention project in late August calling attention to the museum\u2019s perpetuation of the Oriental myth surrounding an over-glorified samurai class and the absence of a more progressive perspective on this iconic symbol of Japan that would actually broadens viewers\u2019 understanding of the samurai rather than stagnate it. As a form of institutional critique, this anonymous group of artists decided to wield the power of parody to make their point and construct their art. The group created \u201casiansart.org,\u201d which masquerades as an \u201calternative\u201d vision of the AAMSF\u2019s official website, asianart.org, highlighting very different aspects of samurai culture. The \u201cLords of the Samurai\u201d exhibit boasted an impressive collection of artifacts from the Hosokawa clan, a prominent daimyo family with a 600 year lineage of political influence. The collection itself is meant to garner an appreciation for the antiqued past of Japan, and is not the target of criticism. There is no doubt that samurai have impacted Japan\u2019s modern culture and the world\u2019s perception of the Japanese as a headstrong, yet honorable peoples. However, were the samurai really as upstanding as centuries of historical propaganda suggest? While the museum promotes the samurai\u2019s interest in cultivated arts and spirituality, \u201casiansart.org\u201d draws attention to the aestheticization of violence, shudo (pederasty), and the ramifications of glorifying the myth of bushido (warrior code of conduct) in modern history. While the shudo aspect is really only reviled in a modern context as homosexuality wasn\u2019t so frowned upon in history, the systematized adaptation of bushido and \u201chonor unto death\u201d into Japanese society carry a modern legacy of militaristic nationalism. Taking a cue from the AAMSF\u2019s promotional image featuring a suit of samurai armor which not so coincidentally seems to be a motif of Darth Vader, the group photoshopped the poster to include Mickey Mouse ears, a human nose, and an ominous image of a mushroom cloud to reinforce the ideals that the group believes the AAMSF is perpetuating with its samurai exhibit. The group went on to spread their own version of the museum\u2019s promotional flyer around the San Francisco metropolitan area as a means of providing the public with a starkly different perspective of the samurai class. The imagery and information provided by the asiansart.org group are purposefully meant to chafe viewers with their harsh radicalism and pointed focus on the socalled \u201cnegative\u201d aspects of samurai culture. They have to no surprise turned off a lot of people who believe that the group\u2019s effort in effect actually paints an exaggerated and insulting picture of the Japanese people as a blood-thirsty and brainwashed population, while tarnishing the legacy of samurai families. I could go into further discussions of the specific arguments brought up, but asiansart.org is so meticulously executed to be simultaneously succinct, poignant, and informationally enlightening that it\u2019s worth a personal visit. The website cites extensively the work of credentialed historians, statistics, news articles, and such, providing links to authoritative sources and the opportunity for more focused information gathering. It is also incredibly open to being challenged, and the dialogue generated by this art campaign is actually much more interesting than the content of the website itself, and further broadens one\u2019s understanding of samurai culture and its discrepancies. Garnering attention from AAMSF, the blogosphere, and academics alike, one cannot say that the asiansart.org project is a half-baked endeavor, as the site is supported by scholarly ethos and a thorough, well-articulated understanding of the subject. The AAMSF has a track record for controversy; its Tibetan exhibit was tainted by the conditions imposed by Chinese government, and its exhibit of a Japanese scroll depicting the conquest of Korea\u2019s Silla Dynasty in the 6th century was protested against by Korean-Americans for propagating a distorted, one-sided view of history. In the case of this recent samurai exhibition, though, the protest is not necessarily over the politics surrounding the art, but rather over what the museum exhibit itself seems to propagate. The anonymous group is concerned with the treatment of the history of the samurai, which is why they have concentrated their efforts on this elaborate public art project. Despite the assaultive execution style of asiansart.org, the concerns behind the website are not unfounded. The Western conception of traditional Japan primarily consists of two figures: the samurai and the geisha, which are also coincidentally two of the most popular exhibits for the AAMSF. This is obviously a very short sighted summation of Japan, and these two characters are often misrepresented to promote an Orientalist vision of sex and violence. Orientalism, although not as overtly racist as cultivated in the 20th century, still prevails in modern Western society. For the Average Joe on the street, though, I find that there is nothing wrong with embracing the novelty and curiosity of other cultures. However, what are the broader implications of perpetuating this sort of cultural narrative in a scholarly space like a museum? Museums are an entrusted public institution. The ultimate responsibility of museums is not just to display and care for artifacts, but to set the tone for a more fourdimensional (historical, social, political, and cultural understanding of the subject at hand. Especially with Asia, much can be lost in translation or misinterpreted due to the contrast of philosophical and cultural foundations between the \u201cEast\u201d and the \u201cWest.\u201d It\u2019s easy to relegate Asian culture to simple tropes. The asiansart.org website employs sensationalist iconography point blank in its parody to illustrate the AAMSF\u2019s own usage of such imagery, no matter how subtle it may be. Even if museums are presumably \u201cnot doing anything wrong,\u201d they need to be held accountable for the message they send to their audiences and really reflect on whether they are educating the public or just feeding them prepackaged stereotypes. When so much effort is put into an exhibit, conscious choices are made to emphasize and omit certain bits of information. The choice of the AAMSF to utilize the stereotypical image of the samurai in its marketing efforts is an intentional one meant to attract as many visitors as possible, and of course, to please their generous patrons who provided them with the opportunity to showcase this collection by not detracting from their own cultivated image. The fact that the AAMSF is a widely known and respected non-profit institution for Asian art, however, would make it appropriate for the museum to explore less abridged and commercialized education. Similarly, the asiansart.org group makes the choice to highlight the most disparaging aspects of samurai culture, as an outrageous statement against the oversimplification of samurai culture that prevails not only at the museum but outside it in society as well. The group does not offer any solutions; it did its job, though, of bringing awareness to this issue of Orientalism in modern public scholarship and sparking dialogue. It\u2019s up to society to stretch its capacity to take the good, the bad, the pretty, and the ugly of all cultures; only then can we achieve true appreciation and true apprehension.\n","html":"<em>Does San Fransico's Asian Art Museum have an image problem?<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>elieen tse<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\u201cWhat awaits you are the hidden treasures from the sacred realm of the elite artistic warrior masters known as the Samurai\u201d: such romanticized language is typical for a museum brochure looking to entice the masses to flood the gates.

Garnering attention from AAMSF, the blogosphere, and academics alike, one cannot say that the asiansart.org project is a half-baked endeavor, as the site is supported by scholarly ethos and a thorough, well-articulated understanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe AAMSF has a track record for controversy; its Tibetan exhibit was tainted by the conditions imposed by Chinese government, and its exhibit of a Japanese scroll depicting the conquest of Korea\u2019s Silla Dynasty in the 6th\r\ncentury was protested against by Korean-Americans for propagating a distorted, one-sided view of history. In the case of this recent samurai exhibition, though, the protest is not necessarily over the politics surrounding the art, but rather over what the museum exhibit itself seems to propagate. The anonymous group is concerned with the treatment of the history of the samurai, which is why they have concentrated their efforts on this elaborate public art project.\r\n\r\nDespite the assaultive execution style of asiansart.org, the concerns behind the website are not unfounded. The Western conception of traditional Japan primarily consists of two figures: the samurai and the geisha, which are also coincidentally two of the most popular exhibits for the AAMSF. This is obviously a very short sighted summation of Japan, and these two characters are often misrepresented to promote an Orientalist vision of sex and violence.\r\n\r\nOrientalism, although not as overtly racist as cultivated in the 20th century, still prevails in modern Western society. For the Average Joe on the street, though, I find that there is nothing wrong with embracing the novelty and curiosity of other cultures. However, what are the broader implications of perpetuating this sort of cultural narrative in a scholarly space like a museum?\r\n\r\nMuseums are an entrusted public institution. The ultimate responsibility of museums is not just to display and care for artifacts, but to set the tone for a more fourdimensional (historical, social, political, and cultural understanding of the subject at hand. Especially with Asia, much can be lost in translation or misinterpreted due to the contrast of philosophical and cultural foundations between the \u201cEast\u201d and the \u201cWest.\u201d It\u2019s easy to relegate Asian culture to simple tropes.\r\n\r\nThe asiansart.org website employs sensationalist iconography point blank in its parody to illustrate the AAMSF\u2019s own usage of such imagery, no matter how subtle it may be. Even if museums are presumably \u201cnot doing anything wrong,\u201d they need to be held accountable for the message they send to their audiences and really reflect on whether they are educating the public or just feeding them prepackaged stereotypes.\r\n\r\nWhen so much effort is put into an exhibit, conscious choices are made to emphasize and omit certain bits of information. The choice of the AAMSF to utilize the stereotypical image of the samurai in its marketing efforts is an intentional one meant to attract as many visitors as possible, and of course, to please their generous patrons who provided them with the opportunity to showcase this collection by not detracting from their own cultivated image.\r\nThe fact that the AAMSF is a widely known and respected non-profit institution for Asian art, however, would make it appropriate for the museum to explore less abridged and commercialized education.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the asiansart.org group makes the choice to highlight the most disparaging aspects of samurai culture, as an outrageous statement against the oversimplification of samurai culture that prevails not only at the museum but outside it in society as well. The group does not offer any solutions; it did its job, though, of bringing awareness to this issue of Orientalism in modern public scholarship and sparking dialogue.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s up to society to stretch its capacity to take the good, the bad, the pretty, and the ugly of all cultures; only then can we achieve true appreciation and true apprehension.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":33,"created_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 20:58:18 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 07 Dec 2010 20:58:18 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":1265,"title":"The Sun Will Not Set on Nichi Bei","slug":"the-sun-will-not-set-on-nichi-bei","markdown":"\n*Nichi Bei Times ceases publication but not without a successor*by **sherry gong**\n\n Nichi Bei Times, a bilingual English and Japanese newspaper, published its final edition on September 10, 2009. This news may come as no surprise given the recession and general decline of print media. But Nichi Bei Times was a publication created by, read by, and (mostly) funded by the people, unlike larger forms of media. To bring the Japanese community together after internment, Nichi Bei Times was created on May 18, 1946. It started out as a daily bilingual newspaper but in 2006 it began publishing a Japanese-only newspaper three times a week along with a weekly English newspaper. The transition occurred because of a continuous decrease in the number of subscribers and advertising revenue, trends that continued until its recent closure. For all the years Nichi Bei Times was in print, it was instrumental in bringing Japanese Americans together. It provided an avenue for Japanese Americans to voice their issues and opinions when they were marginalized by the dominant voice in the media. Nichi Bei Times is most noted for rallying the Japanese American community to demand redress for internment. It also acquired redress for families of miners and railroad workers who were fired after Pearl Harbor and not accounted for in the government\u2019s 1998 redress act. But Nichi Bei Times did not only report on the Japanese American community. Its staff reported the struggles of American Muslims during post-Sept. 11, alluding to Japanese internment during World War II. They also reported on the issue of same-sex marriage in support of it, with former anti-miscegenation laws in mind. While this chapter of Nichi Bei is closing, another one is being written. Former Nichi Bei Times English editor Kenji Taguma, along with other community leaders and Nichi Bei Times contributors and staff, have founded the Nichi Bei Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to publishing Nichi Bei Weekly. Nichi Bei Weekly will be producing an English weekly newspaper, but due to the decrease in Japanese immigration, it is unlikely that there will be a Japanese or bilingual version of the newspaper. To appeal to young people, Taguma would like to continue the efforts to modernize Nichi Bei Times, which have included extended coverage of video games, anime, manga, food, as well as issues focusing on people of mixedrace ancestry and environmental topics. Does including this type of content make Nichi Bei Weekly less empowering than its predecessor? While some of these topics may be less about social justice, they are about community and provide other avenues for Japanese Americans (and non-Japanese Americans) to relate to each other. Hopefully, Nichi Bei Weekly will continue the tradition of branching out to other communities and topics, which will further increase the scope of Nichi Bei Weekly and assist in changing people\u2019s misconceptions about ethnic press. It is easy for people to think that ethnic press is targeted towards one group of people, and miss that it is also intended to educate the general public on how that community feels about certain issues. A publication that more accurately reflects the complexity of issues will allow people to understand different points of view and get a better idea of the bigger picture. Ethnic press is meant to create the understanding that each person has a different history, which affects how he or she views the world as well as how he or she is affected by it. If Taguma pursues the goal of branching out with Nichi Bei Weekly, this effect will become more apparent. Because of the abrupt closing of Nichi Bei Times, the foundation is currently waiting for 501(c)3 status as a nonprofit and consequently has not been able to apply for grants from large foundations. This means it is currently relying on individual donations, which will be retroactively repaid if the IRS gives the Nichi Bei Foundation the 510(c)3 status. After its status is approved, it will supposedly rely on funding from foundations, community fundraisers, and advertising, which should make it more financially stable than its predecessor. The switch from for-profit to nonprofit will likely be a beneficial change for the publication. The Nichi Bei Foundation will not have to worry as much about making enough money to stay afloat. Nichi Bei Times was never about making money anyway, and this makes it easier for the staff to focus on what both Nichi Bei publications were and are intended for: creating and preserving a sense of community. The publication was set to begin printing on September 17, though it is unclear whether it was printed. This is the first time any ethnic press has tried converting to a nonprofit model. If this model succeeds, it will set an example for the ethnic press that serve other communities. If this is something that you would like to support, send in donations to Nichi Bei\u2019s website: nichibeifoundation.org. And if ethnic press is something you are interested in, keep a close watch on the Nichi Bei Foundation as a possibly viable model for the future of ethnic press.\n","html":"<em>Nichi Bei Times ceases publication but not without a successor<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>sherry gong<\/strong><\/p>\r\nNichi Bei Times, a bilingual English and Japanese newspaper, published its final edition on September 10, 2009.

India\u2019s classical arts, rarefied they may be, are no different. When considering Indian classical music or dance, it\u2019s not just the virtuosity of the performer or composition that matters, but also the people and communities that have arisen about them. Srinivas Reddy played in rock bands before practicing classical Indian music. Twelve years ago after moving to the Bay Area, Reddy began to learn the sitar, and has been playing professionally since then. Reddy learned the sitar the \u201cIndian way\u201d \u2013 one-onone with his teacher, a method which allows for a very rich, personal experience. The sitar\u2019s form is analogous to a guitar. Both are stringed instruments, but the sitar is much larger and more complex due to its second bridge for \u201csympathetic\u201d strings. These are not plucked by the musician, but vibrate with the playing of the instrument, producing sonorous and complex music. I was fortunate enough to hear Reddy play the aalap (opening section) of the sri raga in a UC Berkeley lecture hall. A raga can be simplistically defined as a musical mode, specifying tone, rhythm, and melody with a piece. Ragas are associated with specific moods, deities, seasons, or even a time of day: the sri raga is associated with the setting sun. The aalap can be broken up into three parts: a freeform beginning, a section that builds up the rhythm of the piece, and a climax. Reddy explained that the aalap is completely improvised \u2013 although not without guidelines governed by the raga. An entire raga from beginning to end may be up to 85% improvised. Traditional classical Indian music is chamber music. Ragas are conventionally performed by as few as two to five people, with a main vocalist or instrumentalist, accompanied by a drummer and a person who controls the melody. The experience benefits from such intimacy, although modern performances have been given in big halls with microphones. In any case, listening to classical Indian music certainly provides a striking contrast to the homogenized pop music played on the radio today. Third-year Soham Chaudhari learned to dance Bhartantyam in a similarly personal setting as that under which Reddy learned the sitar. Bhartantyam is one of eight classical dances in India, consisting primarily of footwork and hand gestures. The dance scene was so small when Chaudhari began in her hometown of Las Vegas that lessons were conducted at her teacher\u2019s home, although the instructor has since upgraded to a studio. The intimacy that characterizes her experience echoes Reddy\u2019s. The scenes for these classical traditions may be small, but there is something to be said about the type of education a person receives in a personal setting, which provides fertile ground for the growth of interpersonal relationships. For Chaudhari, Indian dance has provided an alternative method to learning about Indian culture, one that isn\u2019t predicated on reading and writing. In Bhartantyam, a religious and cultural history is conveyed through hand gestures and expressions. Chaudhari learned a lot about Indian epic stories, which explain why her family practices the rituals that they do. Moreover, learning classical Indian dance has enriched her dancing in other sectors. \u201cLearning the more traditional way adds refinement,\u201d Chaudhari says, to more modern forms of dance that she is interested in. Certainly classical Indian traditions are not the only way to learn and articulate Indian culture, or even the most popular. Rajiv Khanna, co-president of the Indian Student Association, explains that those who gravitate toward classical forms typically have had that exposure at an early age. To be sure, professionals of classical Indian music are more likely to be Indian, indicating a degree of insularity in the tradition. But Khanna also stresses the importance of traditional Indian holidays like Holi that hold universal appeal. Holi is the spring Festival of Colors, and participants throw colored water or powder on one another. Events like these are a chance to reach out and educate the non-Indian community about traditional Indian culture. Reddy will teach a History of Indian Music class during summer 2010 at UC Berkeley, and his goal is to teach and maintain the classical tradition of music. Although not averse to modern fusion movements, he feels wary \u201cwhen classical music [artists] feel that they have to make their music fusion-like to make it acceptable to Western audiences.\u201d Why compromise such a rich musical heritage to insecurity? To contrast, Reddy\u2019s experiences in concert have been the opposite \u2013 the audiences are of a mixed demographic, with perhaps less than half Indians, and they are always accepting and enthusiastic. It is impossible to keep classical traditions from mutating \u2013 but that isn\u2019t the bottom line. Their transmission is a practice rather than an end-point. We can look to the ragas of Indian classical music as an example. Ragas are traditionally left unwritten, so there is no way of knowing whether the music played today is the same as what was played hundreds of years ago. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that contemporary musicians don\u2019t continue to play in the same vein as did those of the past. Indian classical music still has the power to move audiences, in India and abroad.\n","html":"<em>India's classical music and dance remain relevant abroad <\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>kim filipinas<\/strong><\/p>\r\nTraditions start with people, bring people together, and hold people together.

She is most remembered for being co-anchor of with Dan Rather back in 1993. Chung was the first Asian American and second woman to be named a nightly anchor for a major news channel. In 2002, she was paid $2 million a year working for CNN on Connie Chung Tonight. To simply say Connie Chung is successful is an understatement; her high social and economic status makes her a recognizable icon in the field of journalism. Chung initiated the boom of Asian American females\u2019 entry in news media, with journalists such as Lisa Ling and Carol Lin as prominent successors. Lisa Ling, most notable as the co-host of ABC\u2019s The View and investigative reporter for The Oprah Winfrey Show, is going to host her own talk show on the Oprah Winfrey Channel (to be launched in 2010). Carol Lin has paved a successful career in journalism as a news anchor and correspondent for ABC and CNN. So, it is not surprising that this situation is dubbed the \"Connie Chung Syndrome.\" Asian American female news anchors are ubiquitous. It is not hard to find at least one in each major news broadcasting channel. But\u2026WHERE ARE THE MEN?! So often in the news we see the pairing of a white male and an Asian American female but never the opposite\u2014Asian American male and white female. In 2002 USC\u2019s Annenberg School of Communications conducted a research named \"Asian Male Broadcasters on TV: Where Are They?\" to study the low ratio of male broadcasters compared to female ones. Within the top 25 news markets, there are a total of 106 Asian American anchors\u201486 females and 20 males; in other words, 81% are women while only 19% are men. Even though this study was conducted seven years ago, not much seems to have changed since then. Perhaps these statistics resulted from the fact that viewers are so familiar with this combination that any change will disturb the status quo. Let\u2019s speculate on the different reasons that possibly contributed to the numbers above: 1.) White male dominance. The theory of \"White Supremacy\" isn\u2019t just an idea of the past: it certainly exists today, albeit in a much less prevalent form. This mindset, which uplifts the white race while degrading the others, might be one of the barriers that prevent Asian American men from gaining more successful news broadcasting jobs. In this mostly white-dominant profession, it seems like Asian American males are only assigned to roles of either the weatherman or sports reporter. Do female women from a minority pose less of a threat on television than men from the same minority? Having more Asian American males as news anchors can be interpreted as raising the social status of Asian American males to that of white males, thus eliminating the superior status of white males in this industry. This view implies that the current status of Asian American men is lower than that of white males. 2.) Yellow fever may play a role in this rigid trend. After all, Connie Chung is married to Maury Povich. Yellow fever is the slang term describing white men\u2019s fetish for Asian American females, exoticizing and objectifying them as stereotypical young, submissive, slim women. A mostly white news audience may have this attraction towards Asian American females and prefer them paired with white male anchors. At the same time yellow fever worships Asian American women, it tends to effeminate Asian American men. Often-times, Asian American men are seen as shy, awkward, and lacking masculinity; notice that all of these adjectives are negative. This type of socially damaging depiction of Asian American can be a harmful barrier that keeps them out of mainstream news media. 3.) No talent? And of course, some argue that Asian American men are not entering this field because there is a lack of talent. Really? I don\u2019t think so. One clear example would be the gender ratio in my Media Studies class. About half the students are guys. To me, there is no obvious shortage of talent or interest in media from Asian American men. Richard Lui, a UC Berkeley graduate, is the first Chinese American male and only Asian American to anchor alone for the channel CNN Headline News. Although his accomplishments are comparable to that of Connie Chung\u2019s, Lui is still much less popular. The problem is that the dearth of Asian American anchormen seems to justify the unproven belief that they are not as qualified as white males to appear professionally on television and report the daily news. Whatever the cause may be, no explanation is enough to justify this imbalanced gender ratio. Why can only Asian American females break through the racial barrier and enter the industry while Asian American males cannot experience the same? The disproportion definitely undermines the extent of Asian American representation in public media. It is necessary to keep balances in terms of race and sex. So why does this all matter? It matters because it skews the image of Asian American males, making it appear as if they are not talented enough to become anchormen. It matters because the non-representation impedes Asian American males who want to be future news broadcasters from achieving their dreams. It matters because no one is doing anything about it. Taking away Asian American males\u2019 opportunities to be news anchors is taking away the gender equality necessary for a group\u2019s full representation. The Asian American community isn\u2019t comprised only of women; men are an equally important part! We often advocate for gender equality in today\u2019s society. We have achieved progress to some extent, but have we achieved equality between Asian American women and men? America, known as the \"Land of Opportunity,\" is not living up to its great name as we can witness through the many Connie Chungs and not enough Richard Lius. The lack of Asian American men in news media will continue to feed the stereotype that marginalizes Asian American men as outsiders not talented enough to make it on television. It is not that there aren\u2019t any Asian American male anchors at all, but there should definitely be a lot more. Hopefully, bringing more Asian American men into the industry can cure the insidious infection of the Connie Chung Syndrome.\n","html":"<em>The absence of Asian American males in news broadcasting<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">by <strong>ivonne ho<\/strong><\/p>\r\nMost, if not all, Asian Americans know who Connie Chung is.

To simply say Connie Chung is successful is an understatement; her high social and economic status makes her a recognizable icon in the field of journalism. Chung initiated the boom of Asian American females\u2019 entry in news media, with journalists such as Lisa Ling and Carol Lin as prominent successors. Lisa Ling, most notable as the co-host of ABC\u2019s\r\n\r\nThe View and investigative reporter for The Oprah Winfrey Show, is going to host her own talk show on the Oprah Winfrey Channel (to be launched in 2010). Carol Lin has paved a successful career in journalism as a news anchor and correspondent for ABC and CNN. So, it is not surprising that this situation is dubbed the \"Connie Chung Syndrome.\" Asian American female news anchors are ubiquitous. It is not hard to find at least one in each major news broadcasting channel. But\u2026WHERE ARE THE MEN?!\r\n\r\nSo often in the news we see the pairing of a white male and an Asian American female but never the opposite\u2014Asian American male and white female. In 2002 USC\u2019s Annenberg School of Communications conducted a research named \"Asian Male Broadcasters on TV: Where Are They?\" to study the low ratio of male broadcasters compared to female ones. Within the top 25 news markets, there are a total of 106 Asian American anchors\u201486 females and 20 males; in other words, 81% are women while only 19% are men. Even though this study was conducted seven years ago, not much seems to have changed since then. Perhaps these statistics resulted from the fact that viewers are so familiar with this combination that any change will disturb the status quo.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s speculate on the different reasons that possibly contributed to the numbers above:\r\n\r\n1.) White male dominance.\r\n\r\nThe theory of \"White Supremacy\" isn\u2019t just an idea of the past: it certainly exists today, albeit in a much less prevalent form. This mindset, which uplifts the white race while degrading the others, might be one of the barriers that prevent Asian American men from gaining more successful news broadcasting jobs. In this mostly white-dominant profession, it seems like Asian American males are only assigned to roles of either the weatherman or sports reporter. Do female women from a minority pose less of a threat on television than men from the same minority? Having more Asian American males as news anchors can be interpreted as raising the social status of Asian American males to that of white males, thus eliminating the superior status of white males in this industry. This view implies that the current status of Asian American men is lower than that of white males.\r\n2.) Yellow fever\r\n\r\nmay play a role in this rigid trend. After all, Connie Chung is married to Maury Povich. Yellow fever is the slang term describing white men\u2019s fetish for Asian American females, exoticizing and objectifying them as stereotypical young, submissive, slim women. A mostly white news audience may have this attraction towards Asian American females and prefer them paired with white male anchors. At the same time yellow fever worships Asian American women, it tends to effeminate Asian American men. Often-times, Asian American men are seen as shy, awkward, and lacking masculinity; notice that all of these adjectives are negative. This type of socially damaging depiction of Asian American can be a harmful barrier that keeps them out of mainstream news media.\r\n\r\n3.) No talent?\r\n\r\nAnd of course, some argue that Asian American men are not entering this field because there is a lack of talent. Really? I don\u2019t think so. One clear example would be the gender ratio in my Media Studies class. About half the students are guys. To me, there is no obvious shortage of talent or interest in media from Asian American men. Richard Lui, a UC Berkeley graduate, is the first Chinese American male and only Asian American to anchor alone for the channel CNN Headline News. Although his accomplishments are comparable to that of Connie Chung\u2019s, Lui is still much less popular. The problem is that the dearth of Asian American anchormen seems to justify the unproven belief that they are not as qualified as white males to appear professionally on television and report the daily news. Whatever the cause may be, no explanation is enough to justify this imbalanced gender ratio. Why can only Asian American females break through the racial barrier and enter the industry while Asian American males cannot experience the same? The disproportion definitely undermines the extent of Asian American representation in public media. It is necessary to keep balances in terms of race and sex.\r\n\r\nSo why does this all matter? It matters because it skews the image of Asian American males, making it appear as if they are not talented enough to become anchormen. It matters because the non-representation impedes Asian American males who want to be future news broadcasters from achieving their dreams. It matters because no one is doing anything about it.\r\n\r\nTaking away Asian American males\u2019 opportunities to be news anchors is taking away the gender equality necessary for a group\u2019s full representation. The Asian American community isn\u2019t comprised only of women; men are an equally important part! We often advocate for gender equality in today\u2019s society. We have achieved progress to some extent, but have we achieved equality between Asian American women and men? America, known as the \"Land of Opportunity,\" is not living up to its great name as we can witness through the many Connie Chungs and not enough Richard Lius. The lack of Asian American men in news media will continue to feed the stereotype that marginalizes Asian American men as outsiders not talented enough to make it on television. It is not that there aren\u2019t any Asian American male anchors at all, but there should definitely be a lot more. Hopefully, bringing more Asian American men into the industry can cure the insidious infection of the Connie Chung Syndrome.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":33,"created_at":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 12:27:34 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 12:27:34 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 18 Jan 2011 12:27:34 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1221,"title":"My mom is Chinese","slug":"my-mom-is-chinese","markdown":"\nAmy Chua, you are funny.

The Sixties and Seventies, I mean. You had to be there, sensing the world turning upside down.\u201d The introduction to Stand Up: An Archive Collection of the Bay Area Asian American Movement speaks to the political awakening of the 60s and 70s. It was a time when young people across the country began questioning their world. At UC Berkeley, students formed their own Third World Liberation Front to demand a more inclusive curriculum and to fight for their space in the university. Asian American Studies came out of that struggle. When the program was first established, the Asian American population was a little under 900,000. Today, the Asian American population has grown to 12 million, with 70 percent being foreign-born. The Immigration Act of 1965 can account for the large influx of immigrants in the past 40 years that changed the demographics of our community. Pilipinos, Chinese, and Koreans are among some of the groups that came in the post-1965 immigration. The Vietnam War and the Refugee Act of 1980 also created the conditions for the migration of Southeast Asians into the U.S. According to Asian American Studies Chair Elaine Kim, the changing demographics of the population have sparked the need to restructure Asian American Studies. For the past two years, the program has worked on creating a curriculum that would address the new diversity and issues of the community. As early as next semester, Berkeley students will have the chance to major in Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies (AAADS). AAADS provides a new framework for understanding our community. It situates the historical and contemporary experiences and issues of the community within a transnational and diasporic framework. It recognizes that there is a dialectical relationship between the homeland and the diaspora \u2013 Asian America is informed by Asia, but Asia is also shaped by Asian America. Under the program, students will be required to take five core classes and four electives from three areas of focus: history, community studies, or cultural studies. Students can substitute electives with courses from outside of the program as well, including Asian language courses or Southeast Asian Studies. AAADS also requires that students complete four units of fieldwork in the community. The new diasporic framework will allow us to better understand our communities. Considering the changing demographics of the community, it makes sense. The Asian American Studies conceived in the 1970s was for a community that was predominantly Japanese American and Chinese American. Today, however, Japanese Americans are no longer the largest ethnic group, and 70 percent of the Chinese American community is foreign-born. Southeast Asians and South Asians are the fastest growing ethnic groups. Shifting demographics have led to a shift in power relations among and within ethnic groups, there are differences in socioeconomic statuses that factor into privilege and power. The issues of the community have changed since the establishment of Asian American Studies. It no longer makes sense to study the community without examining the transnational and diasporic context in which communities are formed. In an age of globalization and technological advancement, transnational ties inform the Asian American identity and thus shape contemporary issues. We can apply this transnational and diasporic framework to our work in the community. One of the pillars of Asian American Studies is its commitment to the community. When Asian American Studies was first established, it had an Asian Studies Field Office on Kearney Street, San Francisco which served as a direct liaison between students and the community. Students would bus to Manilatown to attend classes on topics such as health care in the community. They would also participate in community projects. Forty years after Asian American Studies was first established, the Asian Studies Field Office no longer exists. Instead, we have 97\/197 fieldwork units. According to Associate Professor Emeritus Ling-Chi Wang, the de-emphasis on community engagement arose in the 1970s when the university challenged the learning benefits of undergraduate fieldwork. They believed that only graduate students in fields such as law and city planning could benefit from fieldwork. Ethnic Studies and Asian American Studies were reshaped and 97\/197 units were introduced. If we are to remain true to the foundation of Asian American Studies, we need to ensure that our commitment to community engagement is just as rigorous as our commitment to history and theory. We need to further develop our community fieldwork component and reach out to local community organizations. One of the challenges we face in developing our fieldwork component is that local organizations are hesitant to take in college students because we\u2019re a flight-risk. We stay for one semester to get our units and then we leave. Often we leave because we do not build strong connections with the organization and the community that they serve. The potential of our fieldwork is limited due to our short-term commitment. If we are to truly engage in our communities, however, we need to start by changing our relationship with organizations. We\u2019re not there just for the fieldwork units; we\u2019re there to learn, to incorporate theory with practice, and to better our communities. We\u2019re there to be a resource to the organization and hopefully be the bridge between the university and the community. Professor Kim recognizes the importance of community engagement: \u201cThe other thing some people are saying is 'What about all our projects in the community? What about all these really important projects against racism or against economic exploitation or racial injustice?' But the way we can look at it is these communities are diasporic and transnational communities. Most of the people being served are migrants, recent immigrants, and people who speak different languages so all of the issues that face any diasporic community are exasperated in these communities of need. You go to Asian Immigrant Women Advocates, for example, and they\u2019re all different Asian nationalities who don\u2019t speak English and they go back and forth a lot. It isn\u2019t like you\u2019re deserting your commitment to these local communities when you\u2019re taking a diasporic framework.\u201d In the last month, AAADS has taken concrete steps to develop its field studies. AAADS majors will be allowed to receive fieldwork units from classes that already incorporate fieldwork in its curriculum. In addition, a subcommittee of faculty members was formed to further develop the field work component. This is a strong start for the development of the fieldwork component, but more needs to be done if we want to utilize AAADS to its full potential. AAADS will provide us with the tools to better understand ourselves and our communities in a world that is becoming increasingly porous and transnational. As the father of multicultural studies, Ronald Takaki said, \u201cIn our very comprehending, we are in fact changing the world.\u201d Our comprehension need not stop with the classroom. We can learn so much more through our engagement and activism within the community. Asian American Studies was never meant to be an ivory tower, distant and disengaged from the community. Let\u2019s continue to be active participants in our communities and reclaim our place in this world.\n","html":"<em>Looking to the foundations of Asian American and Asian Diaspora studies could help share the major's future direction<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>casey tran<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hadda be there.\r\n\r\nThe Sixties and Seventies, I mean.\r\n\r\nYou had to be there, sensing the world turning upside down.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe introduction to Stand Up: An Archive Collection of the Bay Area Asian American Movement speaks to the political awakening of the 60s and 70s.

Attendees included Rev. Jesse Jackson, Korematu\u2019s daughter Karen, several Congressmen, as well as other dignitaries and students. All had gathered to honor the memory of Fred Korematsu, to discuss the ordeals that he faced on account of his ethnicity during World War II., and to remind people of the grave wrongs committed against Japanese Americans during that turbulent time. All of this was very admirable. However, in the eyes of the law, little has actually changed. He was cleared, but the court's decision has never been officially overturned. We may have a Korematsu Day. Yet, this man is still technically a criminal. He is a monument to the fact that individuals can still be racially profiled during times of emergency. The U.S. Supreme Court Case, Korematsu v. United States is still on the books. The case revolves around President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which forced all people of Japanese descent to move to internment camps. Under the law, it did not matter whether they were American citizens or not. All people of Japanese descent were viewed as potential insurgents and as security threats. For his part, Korematsu had been born in Oakland to Japanese immigrants and had spent his entire life in the United States. He defied the order and was apprehended by the U.S. Army. In his defense, Korematsu argued that he was a fully fledged American citizen entitled to the rights of the U.S. Constitution. But the Supreme Court disagreed. The U.S. Supreme Court, led by Justice Hugo Black, decided that Korematsu did not have those constitutional rights that he claimed \u2013 at least not during the war anyways. The court claimed that in times of crises the government can suspend certain rights. If military necessity calls for it, the government can justifiably engage in racial profiling. As a result, Korematsu was taken and sent to an internment camp until the end of the war. After almost 70 years, some could argue that we have moved past this type of racial discrimination. We do after all now have things like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Brown v. Board of Education, and general improvement in relations between people of different races. Despite all of these things, however, Korematsu is still a loaded gun \u2013 potentially able to go off at any moment. It may not be used against Japanese Americans anymore, but the case could find a target. The events after 9\/11 were probably the biggest scare. There was a fear that individuals of Middle Eastern descent might be apprehended or detained much like their Japanese counterparts in the 1940s. Of course, nothing on that scale happened. However, there were a few flare ups. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld was a notable one. In 2001, Yaser Hamdi was an American citizen who was apprehended in Afghanistan and taken to Guantanamo Bay. His rights as a U.S. citizen were stripped, and he was held indefinitely without any hope of a trial. True, Korematsu and Hamdi are different in many ways. Korematsu was a regular citizen going about his daily business. Hamdi was involved in terrorist activity. Yet, despite the technicalities, the question still remains the same. Can the government strip American citizens of their rights under the U.S. Constitution? Whether they are Asian or Middle Eastern, a working-joe or a suspected militant, do these individuals as American citizens retain certain rights at all times? And more importantly, can an individual\u2019s ethnic or racial background be used as a basis in depriving them of certain rights? The law is unclear \u2013 something which is quite unsettling. It is easy to imagine some dark future where Threat Level Orange finally ends up meaning something really big. In such a case, would the United States, equipped with a conservative bench on the Supreme Court and a Republican Congress, stay true to the principles of the United States Constitution? Is there even a slight chance that we could swing back to the old days of Korematsu? If anything, I hope that was the one achievement of Korematsu Day \u2013 to ensure that something as severe as internment never happens again. To ensure that in the United States, we need to stick to at least some sort of principles.

And principles that make sure we do not abandon the ideals of tolerance that have guided us for the past 50 years.](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-14-3\/uncomfortable-monument\/)\n","html":"<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-14-3\/uncomfortable-monument\/\"><em>The Troubling Legacy of <\/em>Fred<em> Korematsu<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>zarko perovic<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe first Fred Korematsu Day was celebrated this Jan. 30th in our very own\r\nWheeler Hall. Attendees included Rev. Jesse Jackson, Korematu\u2019s daughter Karen,\r\nseveral Congressmen, as well as other dignitaries and students. All had gathered\r\nto honor the memory of Fred Korematsu, to discuss the ordeals that he faced on\r\naccount of his ethnicity during World War II., and to remind people of the grave\r\nwrongs committed against Japanese Americans during that turbulent time. All of\r\nthis was very admirable.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the eyes of the law, little has actually changed. He was cleared,\r\nbut the court's decision has never been officially overturned. We may have a\r\nKorematsu Day. Yet, this man is still technically a criminal. He is a monument\r\nto the fact that individuals can still be racially profiled during times of\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court Case, Korematsu v. United States is still on the\r\nbooks. The case revolves around President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066,\r\nwhich forced all people of Japanese descent to move to internment camps. Under\r\nthe law, it did not matter whether they were American citizens or not. All\r\npeople of Japanese descent were viewed as potential insurgents and as security\r\nthreats. For his part, Korematsu had been born in Oakland to Japanese immigrants\r\nand had spent his entire life in the United States. He defied the order and was\r\napprehended by the U.S. Army. In his defense, Korematsu argued that he was a\r\nfully fledged American citizen entitled to the rights of the U.S. Constitution.\r\nBut the Supreme Court disagreed.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, led by Justice Hugo Black, decided that Korematsu did\r\nnot have those constitutional rights that he claimed \u2013 at least not\r\nduring the war anyways. The court claimed that in times of crises the government\r\ncan suspend certain rights. If military necessity calls for it, the government\r\ncan justifiably engage in racial profiling. As a result, Korematsu was taken and\r\nsent to an internment camp until the end of the war.\r\n\r\nAfter almost 70 years, some could argue that we have moved past this type of\r\nracial discrimination. We do after all now have things like the Civil Rights Act\r\nof 1964, Brown v. Board of Education, and general improvement in relations\r\nbetween people of different races. Despite all of these things, however,\r\nKorematsu is still a loaded gun \u2013 potentially able to go off at any moment.\r\n\r\nIt may not be used against Japanese Americans anymore, but the case could\r\nfind a target. The events after 9\/11 were probably the biggest scare. There was\r\na fear that individuals of Middle Eastern descent might be apprehended or\r\ndetained much like their Japanese counterparts in the 1940s. Of course, nothing\r\non that scale happened. However, there were a few flare ups. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\r\nwas a notable one. In 2001, Yaser Hamdi was an American citizen who was\r\napprehended in Afghanistan and taken to Guantanamo Bay. His rights as a U.S.\r\ncitizen were stripped, and he was held indefinitely without any hope of a\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nTrue, Korematsu and Hamdi are different in many ways. Korematsu was a regular\r\ncitizen going about his daily business. Hamdi was involved in terrorist\r\nactivity. Yet, despite the technicalities, the question still remains the same.\r\nCan the government strip American citizens of their rights under the U.S.\r\nConstitution? Whether they are Asian or Middle Eastern, a working-joe or a\r\nsuspected militant, do these individuals as American citizens retain certain\r\nrights at all times? And more importantly, can an individual\u2019s ethnic or racial\r\nbackground be used as a basis in depriving them of certain rights?\r\n\r\nThe law is unclear \u2013 something which is quite unsettling. It is easy to\r\nimagine some dark future where Threat Level Orange finally ends up meaning\r\nsomething really big. In such a case, would the United States, equipped with a\r\nconservative bench on the Supreme Court and a Republican Congress, stay true to\r\nthe principles of the United States Constitution? Is there even a slight chance\r\nthat we could swing back to the old days of Korematsu?\r\n\r\nIf anything, I hope that was the one achievement of Korematsu Day \u2013 to ensure\r\nthat something as severe as internment never happens again. To ensure that in\r\nthe United States, we need to stick to at least some sort of principles.\r\nPrinciples that can assuage us of fear during times of war \u2013 principles that can\r\nensure we do not commit grave wrongs to our fellow citizens again. And\r\nprinciples that make sure we do not abandon the ideals of tolerance that have\r\nguided us for the past 50 years.<\/a>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Sat, 09 Apr 2011 13:31:30 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 09 Apr 2011 13:31:30 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 09 Apr 2011 13:31:30 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1396,"title":"Cutting the Fat","slug":"what-is-operation-excellence","markdown":"\nby **denise wong**<span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">The United States' present political and sociocultural climate of anti-immigrant jingoism is indubitably escalating to alarming heights, given that the new and improved sequels to Arizona's Senate Bill 1070 are becoming increasingly blatant in their racism. Even more disconcerting is the fact that these newly proposed anti-immigrant hate laws, which make no effort to conceal their legislative racism, are becoming gradually more accepted around the nation.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">The case of Indiana is an aptly emblematic instance. Following Arizona's precedent, Indiana is one of the newest states to introduce a law intended to fix the problem of what is said to be illegal immigration. Latest data from the Pew Hispanic Center estimated Indiana's undocumented population consists of only 85,000 to 150,000 people. Looking at the bill's provisions, however, that statistic is not as stirring as the fact that Latinos comprise the largest non-white racial group and fastest-growing ethnic group in the state, according to a 2007 article from the Indiana *Tribune Star*. Introduced in January, Indiana's Senate Bill 590 would mandate law enforcement officials to ask for the documentation of any individuals in violation of a law or ordinance if there is \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the offender is neither a citizen nor a legal visitor. If this virtual legalization of racial profiling wasn't enough, the bill goes even further to require the exclusive use of English in most government meetings, transactions, and documents, as well as the termination of the state's Spanish language portal, and ballots and other printed materials in other languages. Moreover, the bill would deny financial aid to undocumented students at the University of Indiana and require them to pay out-of-state tuition, prohibit the establishment of Sanctuary Cities, and allow the closing of any business that employs undocumented workers. That a single bill combines the denial of educational opportunities for immigrants, the legalization of racial profiling, and English-only legislation in one package demonstrates that lawmakers are getting more comfortable passing laws that promote racism and xenophobia. All three legislative tactics, particularly the English-only provision, have been continuously used to disenfranchise communities of color. After all, even if it were true that all immigrants magically learn English upon attaining legal status (as apparently assumed by proponents of this policy), they would not necessarily get to the level where they can be civically engaged without translation assistance. Believe what you will about unauthorized immigrants, but it is undeniable that the law targets legal immigrants as well. The racist motives behind SB 590 are thinly veiled in the flimsy excuses given by policymakers who support this law. In an article published by *Hispanically Speaking News*, Indiana Senator Mike Delph (R-Carmel), who filed the bill, said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking the handcuffs off of law enforcement. We\u2019re holding employers who are thumbing their noses at the law accountable. And we\u2019re lifting up the English language.\u201d A Jan. 18th press release by the state of Indiana published additional commentary by Delph: \u201cIt's time that we put an end to press one for English and two for Spanish in our state.\u201d According to a Feb. 18th editorial in the *Indianapolis Star*, the office of Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels acknowledged that Daniels may authorize the legislation if it appears on his desk, but claimed the law would have negligible practical effect. Assuming no practical effect, then, why pass a piece of legislation that would do little other than let everybody know Indiana hates people of color? The arguments in play here appear to be, \u201cIllegal is illegal,\u201d and \u201cYou're in America, now speak English.\u201d The latter point is self-explanatorily racist and xenophobic, even if one ignores how English-only mandates have historically targeted communities of color. The former point, which completely disregards past and present injustices within the U.S. immigration system, is essentially akin to \u201cbecause I said so.\u201d That is, illegality is a crutch for policymakers so they don't have to explain themselves, especially since the exhausted anti-immigrant adages are so easily refuted (according to the Immigration Policy Center, undocumented immigrants in Indiana paid $255.9 million in taxes in 2009, and contributed $7.1 billion to the economy of Indiana in 2009). Considering how mass media has racialized illegal immigrants and how the federal government has historically excluded immigrants based on race (Chinese Exclusion Act, anyone?), the bill becomes suspect, if not obviously racist. As of this writing, the Indiana senate has passed the bill and it is now headed to the governor's desk; this is an unsurprising extension of Indiana's history as a Ku Klux Klan stronghold, where racial backlash has frequently followed threats to white political hegemony. Nonetheless, Indiana is by no means the only state considering SB 1070 copycat legislation. According to Voto Latino, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and South Carolina have already introduced SB 1070-esque bills into their state legislature, while Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah are considering adopting the measure. We now get to the elephantine question in the room: given that 1070-esque legislation is now on the table for many states with significant Asian American communities, how will Asian\/Pacific Americans be implicated in this new period of structural discrimination against immigrants? While APAs share common histories of racialization, discrimination, and exclusion with the targeted Latino community that should already prompt the outrage of the APA community, it seems only a matter of time before anti-Asian sentiment becomes a more explicit part of anti-immigrant sentiment. As stated above, English-only laws have been used in the past to target and disempower communities of color, particularly APA communities. For example, English-only laws passed in Monterey Park, California in the 1980s were the culmination of an intense climate of racism against new Chinese immigrants in the area. Significant APA communities, however, exist in many of the copycat states. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Florida and Texas are among those with the highest Asian populations in the country. Moreover, many of these states are home to \u201cgateway cities\u201d for Asian immigrants, or cities where newly-arrived Asian immigrants tend to cluster. Asian American Studies Professor Michael Omi states that Miami is an established gateway city for Asian Americans, while Charlotte (North Carolina), Fort Worth (Texas), and Atlanta (Georgia) are emerging gateways for Asian immigrants. \u201cThere are significant APA communities in several of the copycat states. For example, in Minnesota, one of the largest Hmong communities in the U.S. resides in that state,\u201d said Connie Choi, staff attorney at the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California (APALC). \u201cIn Pennsylvania, there are significant Asian American Pacific Islander numbers <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">\u2013<\/span><\/span><\/span> including Koreans, Cambodians, Chinese, etc. In Texas, there are large Vietnamese and Chinese communities. In Georgia, there is a growing Korean community, and a prominent Filipino community in Nevada.\u201d Naturally, Asian immigrants in gateway cities have created burgeoning immigrant enclaves, which have prevailed as cultural and commercial centers for APA immigrant residents. Given the fervent climate of anti-Asian xenophobia all over the country (everything from video games that arouse anti-Korean hatred to petitions against Mandarin language classes) and the fact that immigration is a hot-button issue across the nation, the passage of copycat laws makes these communities even more vulnerable to racial harassment. A factsheet on SB 1070 put out by APALC and the Asian American Justice Center before the bill was passed stated, \u201cAs a result [of SB 1070's passing], AAPIs [in Arizona] will be afraid to emerge from their homes out of fear that they will be stopped. They will be deterred from speaking or engaging in other expressive conduct in languages other than English in order to avoid unwanted scrutiny by law enforcement, violating the fundamental right of free speech and expression. They will be unable to celebrate their cultural traditions and commune freely with members of their own community, because doing so may invite unwarranted attention. For example, the law makes it illegal for certain people to transport or live with undocumented immigrants. SB 1070 would also apply to AAPIs that are traveling through or visiting the state.\u201d According to Choi, \u201cIn Arizona, even before SB 1070 was signed into law, AAPIs were discriminated against, harassed, and ultimately made to feel like they were outsiders in their own home state (even if they had lived there all their lives).\u201d It thus follows that the pattern set by Arizona will probably carry over to its copycats, with even more devastating effects on APAs there, unless the communities fight back. APAs were the original \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and targets of the first and only explicitly racist exclusion law. Now, the APA immigrant community is again at a place where it is in danger of legislative targeting and marginalization, in the name of \u201cnational security,\u201d \u201ctaxpayer dollars,\u201d or whatever bullshit excuse they've concocted this time. To reiterate a statement I made in a previous **hardboiled** article (Issue 13.2, \u201cThe Nebulous Masses\u201d), immigration within the APA community cannot be considered epiphenomenal to any other struggle. It is an issue that continues to affect APAs, and must be prioritized by our communities before the attack on Americans of color intensifies. By voicing our resistance before we are implicated as targets, APAs can bring hope to our communities and work toward ending Arizona SB 1070's legacy. \u00a0 <\/span>\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>denise wong<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: small;\">The United States' present political and\r\nsociocultural climate of anti-immigrant jingoism is indubitably escalating to\r\nalarming heights, given that the new and improved sequels to Arizona's Senate\r\nBill 1070 are becoming increasingly blatant in their racism.

You might also think of conservative (mostly white) politicians, and European pilgrims seeking asylum for their religious beliefs. For the longest time, these were the images I subconsciously associated with Christianity as I professed my faith to Christ. It is not surprising then that for much of my life I just felt so culturally disconnected from the Christian community. After Jesus Christ was nailed to that cross, his message spread throughout the Roman Empire, and his legacy was mostly in Europe. In Asia, aside from the sporadic presence of people like the Nestorian monks during the Tang Dynasty, Christianity did not leave much of an impact until the era of European colonialism. Asia and the missionaries were not exactly a match made in heaven (pun intended). The indigenous culture of many Asian ethnicities was condemned as \u201cheathen\u201d by foreign missionaries, and the absence of Christianity was part of the reason many Asian countries were seen as barbaric. It was exactly through instances like French imperialism in Vietnam that the seeds of Christianity were sown into the fabric of various Asian cultures. The actions of some \u201cChristians,\u201d however, are not always reflective of the doctrine of Christianity itself. For me, the missionaries who decided to trample upon Asian culture and impose Christianity as the standard for civility did not reflect the spirit of the Bible. They did not love their neighbors as themselves. It is very much analogous to how President Bush inserted American imperialism into the Middle East under the guise of democratization. While it doesn\u2019t mean that democracy is bad, it does make democracy look bad. So why am I a Christian? As a Chinese American, shouldn\u2019t I be rubbing the belly of some golden Buddha and burning incense? Or, to go with the ideology of Communist China, shouldn\u2019t I be an atheist? One\u2019s ethnic identity does not and should not translate directly into any specific religion. I do believe, however, that Christianity is something that can accommodate my Asian American identity. When the Eurocentric history of Christianity and its politically charged contemporary reputation are all swept aside, what remains is a religion remarkably capable of adapting to different cultures. From its inception, Christianity was a religion catered to Jewish males. Yes, Jesus was not Aryan with fair hair and blue eyes. Instead, he was from Israel in the Middle East. However, the religion that formed around him grew to adapt the culture of the West. Elements of Christianity, such as the Ten Commandments, easily consolidated a Western culture that stressed the rule of law. Then, in America, blacks embraced the concept that all men were equal before God to pursue emancipation from slavery. Blacks also heavily contributed to modern Christian culture through the rhythmic nature of genres like gospel music. Wendy Hu-Au, Team Leader for the Black Campus Ministries fellowship in Berkeley, said that Christianity is like a house with many doors. If there was only one door, then only a Jewish man can be accepted by the Christian God. However, Hu-Au believes that there are numerous doors that serve the specific needs of a diverse and multicultural society. When I heard her say that at the Sunday Night Live event last semester, I realized there was a very specific door for me. If there was a door that is specifically designed for Asian Americans, then why would I have to wholly adopt the Western culture to be Christian, like one of my former pastorshad implied? The answer is that I don\u2019t, and nobody should be able to spiritually guilt-trip me into thinking otherwise. So Christianity doesn\u2019t need to be Western. But does that necessarily mean it could actually accommodate everybody? According to Erina Kim, Intervarsity fellowship staff member, some of the most popular terms used to describe Christians in a survey included \u201chypocritical,\u201d \u201csheltered,\u201d and \u201cjudgmental.\u201d That does not sound like the kind of people who would tolerate those who are different, or be a GoodSamaritan when they see someone in need. Admittedly, some Christians are like that. However, is that reflective of all Christians, or more importantly, what Christianity dictates a Christian should be? The story of Christ showed that he spent most his life in the company of people the mainstream community considered to be inadequate and failures; he appealed to the ones society had often excluded. Wait, excluded? That sounds familiar. In a way, when I reflect on the people Christ chose to represent and how Asian Americans were treated for most of American history, it just makes sense to see Christ as someone who would care about Asian Americans. Nate Lee, a senior in Intervarsity, said, \u201cI hope that the Asian Church in America more fully embraces its mission as a group who have been marginalized in society. Jesus came to set the oppressed free and as Asian Americans\u2026we need to identify as people set free by Jesus. We also have to make a commitment to freeing others, getting involved in social justice rather than building up our own complacent and safe enclaves.\u201d I once heard a song by Asian American rapper Bambu called \u201cMisused.\u201d He made several derogatory references to Christianity, and I was saddened by how much his thoughts on the practice of Christianity rang true. In the song, he claimed to be a \u201cheathen who\u2019d rather see the present be fair than to pray to a white man on a cross instead,\u201d and that he \u201cused to sit in church and look at the stained glass and wonder why none of them looked like [him]. And [he] just don\u2019t want his son to go through that kind of shit.\u201d For Asian American Christians not raised in ethnic enclaves, this sense of ethnic displacement due to religious affiliation is not uncommon. Yet the story of Christ is so much more than just the narrative of one dominant culture. In fact, Christ\u2019s story was meant for people like Bambu, and if the Asian American church wants Christianity to be accessible to theAsian American people, that fundamental belief needs to transcend common misconceptions of what Christianity is, and who it\u2019s for. \u00a0\n","html":"<em>Why Ethnic Identity and Christianity can Coexist<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>steven cong<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you think of church or Christianity, an image that might immediately come to mind is that of a man with fair hair and blue eyes whom everyone worships. You might also think of conservative (mostly white) politicians, and European pilgrims\r\nseeking asylum for their religious beliefs. For the longest time, these were the images I subconsciously associated with Christianity as I professed my faith to Christ.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising then that for much of my life I just felt so culturally disconnected from the Christian community. After Jesus Christ was nailed to that cross, his message spread throughout the Roman Empire, and his legacy was mostly in Europe. In Asia, aside from the sporadic presence of people like the Nestorian monks during the Tang Dynasty, Christianity did not leave much of an impact until the era of European colonialism.\r\n\r\nAsia and the missionaries were not exactly a match made in heaven (pun intended). The indigenous culture of many Asian ethnicities was condemned as \u201cheathen\u201d by foreign missionaries, and the absence of Christianity was part of the reason\r\nmany Asian countries were seen as barbaric. It was exactly through instances like French imperialism in Vietnam that the seeds of Christianity were sown into the fabric of various Asian cultures.\r\n\r\nThe actions of some \u201cChristians,\u201d however, are not always reflective of the doctrine of Christianity itself. For me, the missionaries who decided to trample upon Asian culture and impose Christianity as the standard for civility did not reflect\r\nthe spirit of the Bible. They did not love their neighbors as themselves. It is very much analogous to how President Bush inserted American imperialism into the Middle East under the guise of democratization. While it doesn\u2019t mean that\r\ndemocracy is bad, it does make democracy look bad.\r\n\r\nSo why am I a Christian? As a Chinese American, shouldn\u2019t I be rubbing the belly of some golden Buddha and burning incense? Or, to go with the ideology of Communist China, shouldn\u2019t I be an atheist? One\u2019s ethnic identity does not and should not\r\ntranslate directly into any specific religion. I do believe, however, that Christianity is something that can accommodate my Asian American identity. When the Eurocentric history of Christianity and its politically charged contemporary reputation are all swept aside, what remains is a religion remarkably capable of adapting to different cultures.\r\n\r\nFrom its inception, Christianity was a religion catered to Jewish males. Yes, Jesus was not Aryan with fair hair and blue eyes. Instead, he was from Israel in the Middle East. However, the religion that formed around him grew to adapt the culture of the West. Elements of Christianity, such as the Ten Commandments, easily consolidated a Western culture that stressed the rule of law. Then, in America, blacks embraced the concept that all men were equal before God to pursue emancipation from slavery.\r\nBlacks also heavily contributed to modern Christian culture through the rhythmic nature of genres like gospel music.\r\n\r\nWendy Hu-Au, Team Leader for the Black Campus Ministries fellowship in Berkeley, said that Christianity is like a house with many doors. If there was only one door, then only a Jewish man can be accepted by the Christian God. However, Hu-Au believes that there are numerous doors that serve the specific needs of a diverse and multicultural society. When I heard her say that at the Sunday Night Live event last semester, I realized there was a very specific door for me. If there was a door\r\nthat is specifically designed for Asian Americans, then why would I have to wholly adopt the Western culture to be Christian, like one of my former pastorshad implied? The answer is that I don\u2019t, and nobody should be able to spiritually guilt-trip me into thinking otherwise.\r\n\r\nSo Christianity doesn\u2019t need to be Western.

If you wanted a proper sports riot, go to England, not China. So to Ed Rendell: fu\/du. However, Amy Chua and mainstream commentary both steam from the assumption that parenting techniques influence a child\u2019s future, or at least parenting techniques correlates with offspring success. Although in the end Amy Chua \u201cmoderated\u201d her parenting, she still maintains the assumption that she can have control over her children\u2019s future. To the shock of all parents, there is no correlation between parenting techniques and a child\u2019s academic success. There is no \u201coptimum\u201d parenting technique for Amy Chua or any other overbearing parent to obtain. According to Freakonomics by Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen Dubner, parental behavior is negligible. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Levitt concluded that parental behaviors such as spanking a child, moving to a new neighborhood, limiting television use, or even reading to a child has no effect on standardized test scores. Thus, the quest for the best parenting technique is analogous to the search for El Dorado and unicorns. It may be true parents cannot be too lax. Yet according to Levitt\u2019s research, most modifications in parental behavior have minimal consequence on academics success. Obsessive parents a la Amy Chua are no better than their more moderate, \u201cdeclawed\u201d counterparts. Thus, the so-called \u201cparenting techniques\u201d preached by Amy Chua is inconclusive at best, heresy at worst. If she believes Asians value mathematics so much, why didn\u2019t she analyze government data to obtain an optimal parenting strategy? I expect more from a Harvard educated economics major. What does influence success for children then? According to Levitt and his research, socioeconomic status is more of an influence on academic success than anything a parent does. Moreover, parental education, English as a household language, and having books all influence a child\u2019s success. Having books demonstrates both an emphasis on learning and purchasing power. Non-English speaking households are less well off socioeconomically, and thus their children are generally less successful in school. A child\u2019s success \u201cisn\u2019t a matter of what you do as a parent; it\u2019s who you are.\u201d In short, indelible social class is the main determinant of intelligence and future success. Time Magazine cites the school success in China and other East Asian countries is because of an intensively rigorous academic environment. They used the standardized testing scores from Shanghai to backup their arguments. However, that data must be taken with a grain of salt. Urbane Shanghai students are not a fair representation of China\u2019s population, as they are wealthier and more educated than their rural and migrant brethren. Remember, socioeconomic status correlates with high test scores. Round up a bunch of prep school kids from Philip Exeter, and I\u2019ll bet these American students can rival the teens from Shanghai. Additionally, China is known for \u201csaving face\u201d to the international community (watch the Beijing Olympic Opening Ceremony if you don\u2019t believe me). The Chinese government often tries to portray the People\u2019s Republic as modern and developed as possible, no matter how biased this portrait might be. Who says the government did not specially select a group of high achieving students? Plus, the students were probably given a speech about how the honor of the Motherland depended on this international test. \u201cTraditional\u201d Chinese culture has nothing to do with selection bias. The same concept of selection bias explains why Chinese American students are doing well academically. The bias stems from the Immigration Act of 1965 and its seven point preference system. One of these preferences was reserved for educated, skilled professionals. Educated ethnic Chinese like Amy Chua\u2019s parents (one of whom taught electrical engineering here at UC Berkeley) came into the country through this preference.

When the book was released, it became the hot topic of the nation. At this point, I\u2019m sure everyone has some idea of the book\u2019s content\u2014the rules Chua imposed on her daughters during their childhood: no sleepovers, nothing less than straight As, no personal choice in extracurricular activities and no computer games or TV, just to name a few. I thought I knew what I was getting into\u2014a hardcore Chinese mother who essentially bullies her children into doing what she thinks is best for them, claiming she is doing it for the benefit of their futures, only to have it all backfire on her. Then she lightens up, learns a lesson and everyone is happy. It literally took everything I had to not throw my mom\u2019s new Kindle out the window. As an Asian American Studies major and a Chinese American, I was outraged at every stereotype and overgeneralization Chua made about the Chinese and those she deemed \u201cWesterners.\u201d If an outsider read this book hoping to find some rhyme or reason for the supposedly overzealous nature of Asian parents (immigrant or otherwise), one would automatically chalk it up to the \u201cChinese method\u201d for churning out more superior children compared to the Western style. Chua claims to use the terms \u201cChinese mother\u201d and \u201cWestern parents\u201d loosely, since not all women of Chinese heritage are \u201cChinese mothers\u201d and not all western people are \u201cWestern parents.\u201d You can\u2019t help but feel, however, slapped in the face when this woman, who doesn\u2019t even know you, is insulting you. Hell, I don\u2019t even have kids and I\u2019m offended because she is essentially insulting my mom. My mom is anything but a Tiger Mother. According to the Chinese zodiac she is a Rooster, often characterized as loyal, trustworthy individuals who offer their blunt opinions without being mean-spirited. Many people, including Chua, don\u2019t believe in astrology (western, Chinese or otherwise), but those qualities do describe my mom. She will tell you her honest opinion because you need to know the truth. She can keep secrets, so Harry Potter\u2019s parents would probably still be alive if James and Lily had chosen her as their Secret Keeper instead of Peter Pettigrew. Throughout the entire book, Chua keeps saying, \u201cChinese people do this,\u201d \u201cChinese people do that,\u201d \u201cChinese people believe this,\u201d and it was infuriating because I don\u2019t know why this woman thinks she has the right to speak for an ENTIRE nation of people! Just because she is an \u201cinsider\u201d does not mean she has all the insider information. Chua writes in her book, \u201cWhat Chinese parents understand is that nothing is fun until you\u2019re good at it. To get good at anything you have to work, and children on their own never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences. This often requires fortitude on the part of the parents because the child will resist; things are always hardest at the beginning, which is where Western parents tend to give up\u2026\u201d She manages to uphold that Chinese parents are hardcore about everything in life, and also to insult Western parents who \u201cgive up\u201d at the slightest hint of hardship. In the movie \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), compelled by her overbearing mother, pushes herself to the point of self-destruction in order to perfect her dual lead role. Chua, however, would probably say that Nina\u2019s mother was a \u201cChinese mother\u201d and not the typical \u201cWestern parent.\u201d As <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I<\/span><\/span> was growing up, my mom did encourage me to try to find a hobby. It was partly finding something I liked, as well as something to add to my college application. But my mother was only adamant about my sister and I learning how to swim. She said it was a useful skill that could save my life or someone else\u2019s some day. It wasn\u2019t really hard to get me or my sister to swimming lessons\u2014we were practically fish and swam our way through all the levels offered by our community center. In high school I made my own choices regarding my extracurricular activities, and was involved in journalism, water polo and badminton for four years, and soccer for one. My mom never forced me to do anything I didn\u2019t want to do because she felt there was no point in wasting money on something if I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy it. Chua would probably say my mother was a \u201cWestern parent\u201d despite her being of Chinese descent, but I ended up at Berkeley, so my mom must have done something right. Chua also engages in overgeneralizations and stereotypes to explain her daughters\u2019 aptitude in certain areas. \u201cShe [Sophia, the eldest] was probing and questioning, from the Jewish side. And from me, the Chinese side, she got skills\u2014lots of skills\u2026\u201d Wait, let me get this straight: *all* Jewish people are probing and questioning and *all* Chinese people are incredibly skilled? Maybe this was meant as some sort of joke, but this kind of writing only helps to reinforce the stereotypes people in Ethnic Studies are trying to erase. It doesn\u2019t matter whether these are \u201cgood\u201d stereotypes, as even admirable representations can be harmful. \u201cModel minority,\u201d anyone? Yes, the model minority is detrimental to Asian Americans as well as other groups. This term was originated by dominant society to describe Asian Americans as being able to achieve the kind of success America claims anyone can accomplish when they come to America. It was their way of chiding other minorities, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you do it? They did it.\u201d That image is also damaging to Asian Americans as it creates a high pressure environment where achievements are the only way to evaluate worth. Instead of embracing individuality, it forces Asian Americans into a stereotype: good at math, plays piano, always gets good grades, etc. The model minority also masks problems within our community, as some groups are not as successful as others because they face different sets of issues. While Chua churned out very skilled and disciplined children, she only reinforces the image that Asian Americans don\u2019t value independence\u2014that children are \u201cautomatons\u201d to be programmed into \u201cperfect\u201d people. She actually mocks her husband when he brings up the fact that people are different, that Lulu is not Sophia, and Chua cannot force her to do exactly what Sophia did. This was the most infuriating book I have ever read. Yet, it did make me appreciate my mother more. I\u2019m not a master at anything, but I am happy, and the arguments between my mom and I are nothing compared to Chua and Lulu\u2019s.

When the book was released, it became the hot topic of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I\u2019m sure everyone has some idea of\r\nthe book\u2019s content\u2014the rules Chua imposed on her daughters during their\r\nchildhood: no sleepovers, nothing less than straight As, no personal choice in\r\nextracurricular activities and no computer games or TV, just to name a few.\r\n\r\nI thought I knew what I was getting into\u2014a\r\nhardcore Chinese mother who essentially bullies her children into doing what she\r\nthinks is best for them, claiming she is doing it for the benefit of their\r\nfutures, only to have it all backfire on her. Then she lightens up, learns a\r\nlesson and everyone is happy.\r\n\r\nIt literally took everything I had to not throw my\r\nmom\u2019s new Kindle out the window.\r\n\r\nAs an Asian American Studies major and a Chinese\r\nAmerican, I was outraged at every stereotype and overgeneralization Chua made\r\nabout the Chinese and those she deemed \u201cWesterners.\u201d If an outsider read this\r\nbook hoping to find some rhyme or reason for the supposedly overzealous nature\r\nof Asian parents (immigrant or otherwise), one would automatically chalk it up\r\nto the \u201cChinese method\u201d for churning out more superior children compared to the\r\nWestern style.\r\n\r\nChua claims to use the terms \u201cChinese mother\u201d and\r\n\u201cWestern parents\u201d loosely, since not all women of Chinese heritage are \u201cChinese\r\nmothers\u201d and not all western people are \u201cWestern parents.\u201d You can\u2019t help but\r\nfeel, however, slapped in the face when this woman, who doesn\u2019t even know you,\r\nis insulting you. Hell, I don\u2019t even have kids and I\u2019m offended because she is\r\nessentially insulting my mom.\r\n\r\nMy mom is anything but a Tiger Mother. According\r\nto the Chinese zodiac she is a Rooster, often characterized as loyal,\r\ntrustworthy individuals who offer their blunt opinions without being\r\nmean-spirited.\r\n\r\nMany people, including Chua, don\u2019t believe in\r\nastrology (western, Chinese or otherwise), but those qualities do describe my\r\nmom. She will tell you her honest opinion because you need to know the truth.\r\nShe can keep secrets, so Harry Potter\u2019s parents would probably still be alive if\r\nJames and Lily had chosen her as their Secret Keeper instead of Peter\r\nPettigrew.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire book, Chua keeps saying,\r\n\u201cChinese people do this,\u201d \u201cChinese people do that,\u201d \u201cChinese people believe\r\nthis,\u201d and it was infuriating because I don\u2019t know why this woman thinks she has\r\nthe right to speak for an ENTIRE nation of people! Just because she is an\r\n\u201cinsider\u201d does not mean she has all the insider information.\r\n\r\nChua writes in her book, \u201cWhat Chinese parents\r\nunderstand is that nothing is fun until you\u2019re good at it. To get good at\r\nanything you have to work, and children on their own never want to work, which\r\nis why it is crucial to override their preferences. This often requires\r\nfortitude on the part of the parents because the child will resist; things are\r\nalways hardest at the beginning, which is where Western parents tend to give\r\nup\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nShe manages to uphold that Chinese parents are\r\nhardcore about everything in life, and also to insult Western parents who \u201cgive\r\nup\u201d at the slightest hint of hardship. In the movie \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d Nina Sayers\r\n(Natalie Portman), compelled by her overbearing mother, pushes herself to the\r\npoint of self-destruction in order to perfect her dual lead role. Chua, however,\r\nwould probably say that Nina\u2019s mother was a \u201cChinese mother\u201d and not the typical\r\n\u201cWestern parent.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I<\/span><\/span> was growing up, my mom did encourage me to try\r\nto find a hobby.

The commendation of Bishop is yet another act of civility that has defined Lee\u2019s reputation as the first Asian American mayor of San Francisco. Meanwhile on the other side of the Bay, Mayor Jean Quan cut her pay by 25 percent in her ongoing effort to fix Oakland\u2019s budgetary woes. While it might seem like a political gesture to some, Mayor Quan\u2019s act is impressive considering her predecessor refused to cut his budget and even asked for a pay raise when hefirst entered office. Mayor Quan, the first female and first Asian American mayor of Oakland, came from humble beginnings eating only bok choy for most of her childhood in Livermore. Both Mayors Lee and Quan are not just known around political circles in San Francisco and Oakland for breaking racial trends as the first Asian American mayor for their city. Mayor Lee, for instance, has already made it clear that he intends to tackle the $380 million deficit in San Francisco by holding accountable the city\u2019s numerous non-profit organizations that receive a total of $500 million a year in funding. While it seems rather minuscule, C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle posed the question as to why San Francisco had not done this in the past. \u201cMany of the programs provide overlapping services, aren\u2019t required to prove they are makingan impact, and don\u2019t always need to account for how they\u2019ve spent the city\u2019s money,\u201d Nevius wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d Mayor Lee has also promised to focus his energy on improving businesses in San Francisco. On Feb. 24th, he walked with Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi around Japantown to explore possible options of helping revitalize businesses by engaging one-on-one with local business owners. True to his reputation as an engaging and civil Mayor, Lee has also made his schedule public, and his office in City Hall holds open and public office hours. Meanwhile Mayor Quan has strived to improve relations with the Oakland Police Department in an effort to make Oakland safer. On her first day as Mayor, she met with officers one-on-one in order to gain a more personal understanding of the police force. She also assigned city technicians to focus solely on fixing broken police equipment. Aspart of her ultimate goal to fix Oakland\u2019s budget, Mayor Quan\u2019s long-term goal for the Police Department is to negotiate a cut in their pension plan in exchange for a city parcel tax for more police funding. Of course the story has been told countless times before \u2013 these mayors are different from the rest. But what personal implications do the two mayors\u2019 achievements have on our generation? Lee and Quan represent a new age of politics for Asian Americans \u2013 people like our parents can realistically aspire to be politicians, and good ones at that. Growing up in a Chinese American family, I saw my parents struggle with the same issues that Lee and Quan have experienced. Let\u2019s start with Lee. Other than sharing a surname, Mayor Lee and my father share the same economical sensibility. When Lee was announced as Gavin Newsom\u2019s successor, John Cote of the Chronicle contrasted how Newsom drove a nice luxury SUV while Lee drove an old Toyota Camry to work. Similarly to Mayor Lee, my father always drove a 2000 Corolla to work, parking alongside his coworkers\u2019 luxury cars in the building\u2019s garage. And despite owning a Benz that just sits in the garage gathering dust, my father always preferred to drive the Corolla because of its superior gas millage. Rose Pak describes my father and Lee perfectly, as being \u201cvery frugal, bordering on cheap.\u201d My mother, on the other hand, shares a common background with Mayor Quan. According to an Oakland Tribune article, during Mayor Quan\u2019s childhood in Livermore, she lived in cramped homes, and every penny was sent to her older sister in China. Quan had to eat the same meal every day growing up in order to save money. Moreover she faced racial discrimination for being Chinese in a predominantly Caucasian area. As the only daughter in a traditional Taishan family in Chinatown, my mother was in the same position as young Mayor Quan. My mother lived in a cramped apartment and slept on the living room couch, while her brothers slept in one room and her parents slept in another. Whenever my mother did leave Chinatown to help on the family farm, she faced discrimination on the basis of her ethnic background. But unlike Mayor Quan, my mother was unable to receive a higher education due to the struggles of providing for a family. My mother worked to provide for my father\u2019s education and never spent money on herself. Meanwhile, Quan graduated from UC Berkeley and went on to fight for civil rights and an Ethnic Studies department at UC Berkeley and SF State. While our generation may often laugh at how \u201cAsian\u201d our parents are, as exemplified by websites like \u201cMy Mom is a Fob,\u201d we sometimes forget to put the humor aside and look at the root cause of our parent\u2019s supposedly peculiar characteristics \u2013 their sacrifice for our sakes.

Like our parents, they continue to fight to provide benefits for all of us, especially the next generation. And while my father and mother might not be politicians themselves, they too share the same value of sacrificing for others to provide us with what they didn\u2019t have.

From a company\u2019s perspective, running an ad during the Super Bowl is equivalent to having a stock ticker symbol or a store on Rodeo Drive \u2013 it amps up the legitimacy and, hopefully, increases profit margins. For Super Bowl XLV, Groupon\u2019s Tibet themed advertisement was one of three ads for their Super Bowl marketing campaign and it garnered a lot of controversy. This 30 second spot starts off with a documentary vibe, explaining, \u201cthe people of Tibet are in trouble. Their very culture is in jeopardy...But they still whip up an amazing fish curry.\u201d The ad carries a nonchalant tone in its reference to China\u2019s takeover of Tibet in 1950 and subsequent erosion of Tibetan culture, language, natural resources, and human rights. Given that Groupon was only founded two years ago and is headquartered in Chicago, this Super Bowl campaign is a big visibility booster. They wanted to create buzz with their Tibet advertisement. In fact, they called on mockumentary director Christopher Guest to lead the whole project. Even if their intentions weren\u2019t rooted in offending viewers and potential Groupon groupies \u2013 after all, Groupon\u2019s chief executive Andrew Mason put it best when he said that \u201cthe last thing we wanted was to offend our customers. It\u2019s bad business\u201d \u2013 this is exhibit A in demonstrating the insensitivity and juvenile approach that many American businesses employ today. What was most interesting during this ordeal was the \u201capology\u201d that Groupon released in response to the uproar. Many upset individuals who emailed Groupon received this reply: \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t mean to offend with our advertisements. We think renting celebrities to promote our 'Save the Money' campaign is pretty funny, but we understand if it doesn\u2019t tickle you the right way.\u201d In other words, the burden is on the viewer to enjoy the humor of the ad, and Groupon is sorry that particular individuals don\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d Not once did the company address the issues in Tibet and encourage some sort of call to action. Understandably, it is not always the place for businesses to take a political stance. However, if Groupon wanted to risk being controversial, it should be for pushing the envelope and enlightening fellow Americans of this foreign policy issue, not for exploiting a historical event of oppression. Surprisingly, when individuals went to Groupon\u2019s website to purchase their fish curry coupon, they found a link to a donation page to support the Tibetan people. If Groupon wanted to do more than just trivialize the conflict in Tibet, they definitely needed to have copy at the end of their ad referencing their donation website. That logical disclaimer, however, was not implemented. Thus, a paradox is created where Groupon claims to be trying to put a spotlight on Tibet while their Super Bowl ad upstages that serious consideration with cheap fish curry. Even though there was a donation page on the website, this advertisement was not a humbling education experience and I would say that individuals who visited that page obviously weren\u2019t offended by the advertisement. If one truly understood the capacity of Tibet\u2019s deeoly-rooted oppression, hower, it would be hard not to resent the ad. Customers donating to Groupon\u2019s philanthropic Tibet fund aren\u2019t educating themselves on the implications of this situation. If Groupon truly had sincere intentions with their offer, they shouldn\u2019t have juxtaposed such an intense social issue with humor. Apparently, Groupon isn't the only company resorting to tasteless methods to fulfill their profit-oriented bottom line. Take for example, Kenneth Cole, who decided to piggyback on Egypt\u2019s people power to draw attention to their Spring 2011 collection release. Using the trending hash tag \u201c#Cairo\u201d on Twitter, Kenneth Cole tweeted: \u201cMillions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available at http:\/\/bit.ly\/KCairo.\u201d Apparently \u201csatire\u201d and \u201cwit\u201d are things Kenneth Cole\u2019s Twitter account isn\u2019t lacking. They clearly have such a strong grasp on contemporary social and international issues that they felt it appropriate to use these current events as publicity vehicles. Twitter account KennethColePR has previously blasted tweets like, \u201cPeople from New Orleans are flooding into Kenneth Cole stores!\u201d and \u201cOur new looks are dropping faster than the World Trade Center.\u201d Kenneth Cole himself, the chairman and Chief Creative Officer of the company, released a statement saying, \u201cI apologize to everyone who was offended by my insensitive tweet about the situation in Egypt. I\u2019ve dedicated my life to raising awareness about serious social issues, and in hindsight my attempt at humor regarding a nation liberating themselves against oppression was poorly timed and absolutely inappropriate.\u201d Chronologically, the Cairo tweet succeeded the New Orleans and World Trade Center tweets. I guess the PR department didn\u2019t get enough of a backlash before because this apology to their most recent social issue tweet makes it sound like this was the very first time this kind of incident has happened. These new tricks of the trade to get consumer attention aren\u2019t the only tactics flying in this media storm of controversy.

Big corporations need to stop seeing social issues and people of color with dollar signs. If they aren\u2019t willing to instigate or help propel positive social change, they can at least not step on the toes of those who need it the most.\n","html":"<em>How Corporate Media has been Treading on the Toes of Communities<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>crystal sitt<\/strong>\r\n\r\nEvery year, the Super Bowl draws in a large enough audience to justify its baseline asking price for advertisements of $3 million dollars. From a company\u2019s perspective, running an ad during the Super Bowl is equivalent to having a stock ticker symbol or a store on Rodeo Drive \u2013 it amps up the legitimacy and, hopefully, increases profit margins. For Super Bowl XLV, Groupon\u2019s Tibet themed advertisement was one of three ads for their Super Bowl marketing campaign and it garnered a lot of controversy.\r\n\r\nThis 30 second spot starts off with a documentary vibe, explaining, \u201cthe people of Tibet are in trouble. Their very culture is in jeopardy...But they still whip up an amazing fish curry.\u201d The ad carries a nonchalant tone in its reference to China\u2019s takeover of Tibet in 1950 and subsequent erosion of Tibetan culture, language, natural resources, and human rights.\r\n\r\nGiven that Groupon was only founded two years ago and is headquartered in Chicago, this Super Bowl campaign is a big visibility booster. They wanted to create buzz with their Tibet advertisement. In fact, they called on mockumentary director Christopher Guest to lead the whole project. Even if their intentions weren\u2019t rooted in offending viewers and potential Groupon groupies \u2013 after all, Groupon\u2019s chief executive Andrew Mason put it best when he said that \u201cthe last thing we wanted was to offend our customers. It\u2019s bad business\u201d \u2013 this is exhibit A in demonstrating the insensitivity and juvenile approach that many American businesses employ today.\r\n\r\nWhat was most interesting during this ordeal was the \u201capology\u201d that Groupon released in response to the uproar. Many\r\nupset individuals who emailed Groupon received this reply: \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t mean to offend with our advertisements. We think renting celebrities to promote our 'Save the Money' campaign is pretty funny, but we understand if it doesn\u2019t tickle you the right way.\u201d In other words, the burden is on the viewer to enjoy the humor of the ad, and Groupon is sorry that particular individuals don\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d Not once did the company address the issues in Tibet and encourage some\r\nsort of call to action. Understandably, it is not always the place for businesses to take a political stance. However, if Groupon wanted to risk being controversial, it should be for pushing the envelope and enlightening fellow Americans of this foreign policy issue, not for exploiting a historical event of oppression.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, when individuals went to Groupon\u2019s website to purchase their fish curry coupon, they found a link to a donation page to support the Tibetan people. If Groupon wanted to do more than just trivialize the conflict in Tibet, they definitely needed to have copy at the end of their ad referencing their donation website. That logical disclaimer, however, was not implemented. Thus, a paradox is created where Groupon claims to be trying to put a spotlight on Tibet while their Super Bowl ad upstages that serious consideration with cheap fish curry.\r\n\r\nEven though there was a donation page on the website, this advertisement was not a humbling education experience and I\r\nwould say that individuals who visited that page obviously weren\u2019t offended by the advertisement. If one truly understood the capacity of Tibet\u2019s deeoly-rooted oppression, hower, it would be hard not to resent the ad. Customers donating to Groupon\u2019s philanthropic Tibet fund aren\u2019t educating themselves on the implications of this situation. If Groupon truly had sincere intentions with their offer, they shouldn\u2019t  have juxtaposed such an intense social issue with humor.\r\n\r\nApparently, Groupon isn't the only company resorting to tasteless methods to fulfill their profit-oriented bottom line. Take for example, Kenneth Cole, who decided to piggyback on Egypt\u2019s people power to draw attention to their Spring 2011 collection release. Using the trending hash tag \u201c#Cairo\u201d on Twitter, Kenneth Cole tweeted: \u201cMillions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available at http:\/\/bit.ly\/KCairo.\u201d Apparently \u201csatire\u201d and \u201cwit\u201d are things Kenneth\r\nCole\u2019s Twitter account isn\u2019t lacking. They clearly have such a strong grasp on contemporary social and international issues that they felt it appropriate to use these current events as publicity vehicles. Twitter account KennethColePR has previously blasted tweets like, \u201cPeople from New Orleans are flooding into Kenneth Cole stores!\u201d and \u201cOur new looks are dropping faster than the World Trade Center.\u201d\r\n\r\nKenneth Cole himself, the chairman and Chief Creative Officer of the company, released a statement saying, \u201cI apologize to everyone who was offended by my insensitive tweet about the situation in Egypt. I\u2019ve dedicated my life to raising awareness about serious social issues, and in hindsight my attempt at humor regarding a nation liberating themselves against oppression was poorly timed and absolutely inappropriate.\u201d Chronologically, the Cairo tweet succeeded the New Orleans and World Trade Center tweets. I guess the PR department didn\u2019t get enough of a backlash before because this apology to their most recent social issue tweet makes it sound like this was the very first time this kind of incident has happened.\r\n\r\nThese new tricks of the trade to get consumer attention aren\u2019t the only tactics flying in this media storm of controversy. There are still companies like MetroPCS, who employ stereotypes in their recent Super Bowl ad with two Indian characters who host \u201cTech &amp; Talk.\u201d The ad exploits stereotypes that are extremely demeaning to the Indian population.

Developed by Kaos Studios and published by THQ, the game is currently scheduled for release on March 15th. As a first-person shooter, \u201cHomefront\u201d centers on gun combat from the first-person perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a huge geek and have been enjoying video games since I was a kid, so I sometimes find it hard to critique video games simply due to my fond memories of them. Yet, I readily threw out my qualms about critiquing video games after learning about the premise of \u201cHomefront.\u201d The action takes place in 2027 when Korea is reunified under Kim Jong-il\u2019s son Kim Jong-un, and the U.S. economy collapses due to a dramatic increase in oil prices. Sounds bad? It gets worse.\n\nWith American global pres\u00adence diminished, the unified Korea annexes a number of countries in Asia, including Japan. Finally, tak\u00ading advantage of a pandemic that has swept through the U.S., as well as employing a strategic military strike against U.S.  \n communication systems (the Koreans actually trick the Americans into believing that they are sending a \u201cmessage of peace\u201d), the Korean People\u2019s Army invades American soil.\n\nThere\u2019s so much wrong with this premise that I almost don\u2019t know where to start, but let\u2019s just begin with the story overview. Its game developers have labeled \u201cHomefront\u201d as a work of \u201cspecu\u00adlative fiction,\u201d and great lengths have been taken to ensure that the premise is a \u201cplausible\u201d one. The game was written by John Milius, co-writer of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and \u201cRed Dawn\u201d (the 1984 film in which the Soviet Union invades the United States and is beaten back by a team of teenagers). Furthermore, former CIA field agent Tae Kim was hired as a consultant.\n\nAccording to Kim, \u201cfrom the very day the invasion starts in the game, if you combine everything, the odds are very, very slim this becomes true. But when you look at the storyline step by step, every step is a coin flip but a plausible step. So once you get  \n there, it\u2019s plausible. And from there the next step is plausible as well. Even though the whole thing is fictional, it comes with plausible baby steps.\u201d\n\nWhile it may seem presumptuous of me to question the words of a former CIA agent, there is a lot of what he says that is simply hard to buy. It\u2019s easy to say that every part of the story is \u201cplausible\u201d without thinking through each portion critically, and  \n therefore oversimplify the story pieces that you put together. This is exactly what the storyline of \u201cHomefront\u201d does. The most problematic piece of \u201cHomefront\u2019s\u201d story is ob\u00advious: the reunification of Korea. To suggest that within the next couple of years (In the game, Korea is reunified in the year 2013) Korea can be unified, seemingly without any out\u00adside intervention,  \n dramatically oversimplifies the issue of both the conflict between North and South Korea, and the interna\u00adtional relations of the region as a whole. The fact that the mi\u00adraculous reunification and essential takeover of Asia by Korea  \n can be seen as a \u201cplausible step\u201d speaks to me of a severe lack of understanding of the political landscape of East Asia.\n\nSome may take a look at the issues I\u2019ve raised and dismiss them on the grounds that I am over-analyzing what is only a fictional storyline to be used in a fun action game. However, this leads to the next issue I have with \u201cHomefront,\u201d which is the emotional  \n reaction that the developers are trying to elicit with this game. While action games in which the main goal is to run around and shoot as many enemies as virtually possible are by no means rare, the developers of \u201cHomefront\u201d have attempted to set their game apart from other first-person shooters by emphasizing emotional response, which is gener\u00adally hard to accomplish with the  \n detached medium of video games.\n\nWith most games lacking the high-quality visuals of film and the creative capacity of literature, few games are im\u00admersive enough to allow the audience to invest themselves in the characters or plot development. The developers at Kaos Studios, however, may have gotten it right with \u201cHomefront.\u201d According to an article by Ste\u00adphen Totilo of video game blog Kotaku, \u201cI have little animosity for the virtual people I shoot in video games. They are card\u00adboard targets. The worst they can do is kill the virtual me. My \u2018death\u2019 lasts a few seconds. I can\u2019t hate them for that. This changed last week. I played the beginning of the upcom\u00ading first-person shooter Home\u00adfront and I felt a burning urge in the game to do right with the trigger of a virtual gun.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to spell out why such sentiments are deeply problematic and disturbing. And while a video game\u2019s ability to draw out angry and violent emotional responses is not uncommon, it is more often that games are used as a form of catharsis. When I play shooter games, I do so because I want to release the anger or bloodlust that I\u2019m feeling at the moment. On the other hand, \u201cHome\u00adfront\u201d aims to recreate and reinforce that anger and bloodlust.\n\nFur\u00adthermore, we all under\u00adstand the abil\u00adity of media to shape public perception (as supported by the correla\u00adtion between increased me\u00addia animosity toward Mus\u00adlim and Arab countries and the continuous rise in hate crimes against Muslim and Arab  \n Americans). The xenophobic tendencies of the media, which are directed not just at Arab Americans but also at Asian Americans with discussion about \u201cthreats in Asia,\u201d combined with the fact that too many people don\u2019t bother to make a  \n distinction between Korean, Japanese and Chinese or any other Asian (the murder of Vincent Chin comes to mind here), makes it easy to see the negative im\u00adplications this game has on the Asian American community. The developers at Kaos Studios  \n should have understood the ramifications of portraying all Koreans as unrepentant killers of mothers and children, especially to an audience that is becoming increasingly hostile to those with \u201cOriental\u201d faces.\n\nNow, it\u2019s here that I have to include a disclaimer, and I\u2019m not just doing this to cover my own ass and appear \u201cob\u00adjective,\u201d but as an honest gesture of hope. Considering the fact that \u201cHomefront\u201d has yet to be released and the only previews of the game cover  \n the first level, it\u2019s a little bit too early to pass such scathing judgment on the game. One of the great things about video games is their length, and with most games lasting at least 10 hours long, there is plenty of room for plot development and change. It can very well be possible that the developers over at Kaos Studios have fore\u00adseen the controversy around this game and have  \n addressed it within the game\u2019s storyline.\n\nPreview articles have mentioned the inclusion of a Korean American internment camp within the game\u2019s narra\u00adtive. If used properly, the game could very well send a strong message against the use of racial profiling and remind us why Japanese internment was such a shameful period in our history. Other factors such as the inclusion of a Korean American protagonist could even redeem the game in my eyes. Nonetheless, given the steady increase in displays of anti-Asian sentiment (the planned remake of \u201cRed Dawn\u201d where the invader is no longer the Soviet Union, but Com\u00admunist China, is a testament to this) as well as an overall poor track record for first-person shooter storylines, I\u2019m not going to hold my breath.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p>by <strong>jeffrey pu<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Upcoming video game \u201cHomefront\u201d could be the newest addition to a lineage of anti-Communism\/anti-Asia war games.

While action games in which the main goal is to run around and shoot as many enemies as virtually possible are by no means rare, the developers of \u201cHomefront\u201d have attempted to set their game apart from other first-person shooters by emphasizing emotional response, which is gener\u00adally hard to accomplish with the detached medium of video games. With most games lacking the high-quality visuals of film and the creative capacity of literature, few games are im\u00admersive enough to allow the audience to invest themselves in the characters or plot development. The developers at Kaos Studios, however, may have gotten it right with \u201cHomefront.\u201d According to an article by Ste\u00adphen Totilo of video game blog Kotaku, \u201cI have little animosity for the virtual people I shoot in video games. They are card\u00adboard targets. The worst they can do is kill the virtual me. My \u2018death\u2019 lasts a few seconds. I can\u2019t hate them for that. This changed last week. I played the beginning of the upcom\u00ading first-person shooter Home\u00adfront and I felt a burning urge in the game to do right with the trigger of a virtual gun.\u201d I don\u2019t think I need to spell out why such sentiments are deeply problematic and disturbing. And while a video game\u2019s ability to draw out angry and violent emotional responses is not uncommon, it is more often that games are used as a form of catharsis. When I play shooter games, I do so because I want to release the anger or bloodlust that I\u2019m feeling at the moment. On the other hand, \u201cHome\u00adfront\u201d aims to recreate and reinforce that anger and bloodlust. Fur\u00adthermore, we all under\u00adstand the abil\u00adity of media to shape public perception (as supported by the correla\u00adtion between increased me\u00addia animosity toward Mus\u00adlim and Arab countries and the continuous rise in hate crimes against Muslim and Arab Americans). The xenophobic tendencies of the media, which are directed not just at Arab Americans but also at Asian Americans with discussion about \u201cthreats in Asia,\u201d combined with the fact that too many people don\u2019t bother to make a distinction between Korean, Japanese and Chinese or any other Asian (the murder of Vincent Chin comes to mind here), makes it easy to see the negative im\u00adplications this game has on the Asian American community. The developers at Kaos Studios should have understood the ramifications of portraying all Koreans as unrepentant killers of mothers and children, especially to an audience that is becoming increasingly hostile to those with \u201cOriental\u201d faces. Now, it\u2019s here that I have to include a disclaimer, and I\u2019m not just doing this to cover my own ass and appear \u201cob\u00adjective,\u201d but as an honest gesture of hope. Considering the fact that \u201cHomefront\u201d has yet to be released and the only previews of the game cover the first level, it\u2019s a little bit too early to pass such scathing judgment on the game. One of the great things about video games is their length, and with most games lasting at least 10 hours long, there is plenty of room for plot development and change. It can very well be possible that the developers over at Kaos Studios have fore\u00adseen the controversy around this game and have addressed it within the game\u2019s storyline. Preview articles have mentioned the inclusion of a Korean American internment camp within the game\u2019s narra\u00adtive. If used properly, the game could very well send a strong message against the use of racial profiling and remind us why Japanese internment was such a shameful period in our history. Other factors such as the inclusion of a Korean American protagonist could even redeem the game in my eyes. Nonetheless, given the steady increase in displays of anti-Asian sentiment (the planned remake of \u201cRed Dawn\u201d where the invader is no longer the Soviet Union, but Com\u00admunist China, is a testament to this) as well as an overall poor track record for first-person shooter storylines, I\u2019m not going to hold my breath. \u00a0\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>jeffrey pu<\/strong>\r\n\r\nUpcoming video game \u201cHomefront\u201d could be the newest addition to a lineage of anti-Communism\/anti-Asia war games. Developed by Kaos Studios and published by THQ, the game is currently scheduled for release on March 15th. As a first-person shooter, \u201cHomefront\u201d centers on gun combat from the first-person perspective.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve always been a huge geek and have been enjoying video games since I was a kid, so I sometimes find it hard to critique video games simply due to my fond memories of them. Yet, I readily threw out my qualms about critiquing video games after learning about the premise of \u201cHomefront.\u201d The action takes place in 2027 when Korea is reunified under Kim Jong-il\u2019s son Kim Jong-un, and the U.S. economy collapses due to a dramatic increase in oil prices. Sounds bad? It gets worse.\r\n\r\nWith American global pres\u00adence diminished, the unified Korea annexes a number of countries in Asia, including Japan. Finally, tak\u00ading advantage of a pandemic that has swept through the U.S., as well as employing a strategic military strike against U.S.\r\ncommunication systems (the Koreans actually trick the Americans into believing that they are sending a \u201cmessage of peace\u201d), the Korean People\u2019s Army invades American soil.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s so much wrong with this premise that I almost don\u2019t know where to start, but let\u2019s just begin with the story overview. Its game developers have labeled \u201cHomefront\u201d as a work of \u201cspecu\u00adlative fiction,\u201d and great lengths have been taken to ensure that the premise is a \u201cplausible\u201d one. The game was written by John Milius, co-writer of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and \u201cRed Dawn\u201d (the 1984 film in which the Soviet Union invades the United States and is beaten back by a team of teenagers). Furthermore, former CIA field agent Tae Kim was hired as a consultant.\r\nAccording to Kim, \u201cfrom\r\nthe very day the invasion starts in the game, if you combine everything, the\r\nodds are very, very slim this becomes true. But when you look at the storyline\r\nstep by step, every step is a coin flip but a plausible step. So once you get\r\nthere, it\u2019s plausible. And from there the next step is plausible as well. Even\r\nthough the whole thing is fictional, it comes with plausible baby steps.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile it may seem\r\npresumptuous of me to question the words of a former CIA agent, there is a lot\r\nof what he says that is simply hard to buy. It\u2019s easy to say that every part of\r\nthe story is \u201cplausible\u201d without thinking through each portion critically, and\r\ntherefore oversimplify the story pieces that you put together. This is exactly\r\nwhat the storyline of \u201cHomefront\u201d does. The most problematic piece of\r\n\u201cHomefront\u2019s\u201d story is ob\u00advious: the reunification of Korea. To suggest that\r\nwithin the next couple of years (In the game, Korea is reunified in the year\r\n2013) Korea can be unified, seemingly without any out\u00adside intervention,\r\ndramatically oversimplifies the issue of both the conflict between North and\r\nSouth Korea, and the interna\u00adtional relations of the region as a whole. The\r\nfact that the mi\u00adraculous reunification and essential takeover of Asia by Korea\r\ncan be seen as a \u201cplausible step\u201d speaks to me of a severe lack of\r\nunderstanding of the political landscape of East Asia.\r\n\r\nSome may take a look at\r\nthe issues I\u2019ve raised and dismiss them on the grounds that I am over-analyzing\r\nwhat is only a fictional storyline to be used in a fun action game. However,\r\nthis leads to the next issue I have with \u201cHomefront,\u201d which is the emotional\r\nreaction that the developers are trying to elicit with this game.

Search of Hope","slug":"in-search-of-hope","markdown":"\nby **margaret zhou** In the wake of a devastating earthquake and tsunami that have resulted in 13,700 deaths and with a remaining 14,000 people missing as of April 15, there are many who lack all notions of morality, sympathy, and humanity, and openly state that the natural disaster was Japan\u2019s \u201cpayback\u201d for Pearl Harbor or a \u201cmessage from God.\u201d According to 8asians.com, television writer Alec Sulkin\u2019s tweet that read, \u201cIf you wanna feel better about this earthquake in Japan, google \u2018Pearl Harbor death toll\u2019\u201d was re-tweeted by over 100 of his followers within the first four hours after he posted it. There were enough twitter posts making similar comments to make \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d a popular trending topic on Twitter. Hundreds of Facebook users posted similarly hurtful status updates. These comments are so ridiculously ignorant, racist and spiteful that they don\u2019t even merit a well thought-out comeback, but immediately upon reading them I wanted to ask their writers if they remembered those two atomic bombs the great old red and white blue dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For the record, the combined death toll that resulted from the two bombs is conservatively estimated at 225,000, while the Pearl Harbor death toll is listed at 2,700 (11,000 fewer deaths than resulted from the earthquake and tsunami). Besides, there is no legitimacy in the notion of \u201ctaking revenge\u201d on an entire population of people for the actions of their government. And finally, how can one compare the motivation behind an act of war to an act of nature, which is completely apolitical and unmotivated? But there\u2019s more. On the March 14 airing of his radio show, Glenn Beck announced in his characteristically incoherent style, complete with obnoxious belly chuckle and all, that \u201cI\u2019m not saying God is, you know causing earthquakes\u2026But I\u2019ll tell you this: There\u2019s a message being sent. And that is, \u2018Hey you know that stuff we\u2019re doing?\u2019 Not really working out real well. Maybe we should stop doing some of it. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d Despite Beck\u2019s plain stupidity, many of his followers and equally ignorant and insensitive religious conservatives continued to offend the Christian faith by making similar statements. One girl\u2019s YouTube vlog in which she praised God for \u201cshaking Japan\u201d and waking up all the non-believers caused intense controversy and debate. A few days later the girl \u201ccame clean\u201d in another video where she stated that her comments were meant to be a joke. It doesn\u2019t even need to be said that something is seriously wrong when the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and the condition of families who are now homeless, jobless, hungry and traumatized are seen by some as appropriate topics for \u201cjokes.\u201d \u00a0 **Damage and Devastation** To gain a better sense of the ignorance and lack of humanity behind the \u201cJapan deserved it\u201d rhetoric, we need a complete picture of what the Japanese people have suffered since the quake. The 9.0 magnitude quake hit Japan on March 11, and generated a 10 meter high tidal wave that washed away houses, cars, infrastructure, people and even entire coastal villages. The search for more than 14,000 missing people continues among rubble. Hundreds and even thousands have been placed in evacuation shelters, where health resources and basic necessities are scarce. According to the Huffington Post, \u201cThe quake and tsunami also damaged the critical cooling system at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, which overheated and began spewing radiation into the environment.\u201d As a result, radiation has been found in milk, water, and 11 types of vegetables grown in areas around the plant. Tokyo residents are storing up on bottled water and basic necessities, leaving supermarket shelves across the city bare. According to the Post, some supermarkets have even imposed a buying ration to prevent hoarding. In addition to the fears caused by radiation leaks, survivors of the quake also have to deal with the anxiety of aftershocks that continue to damage infrastructure. Hundreds of aftershocks, some measuring up to over 6.0 magnitude, have been reported in the five weeks since the quake. According to Aljazeera News, \u201cMany now complain of a queasy sensation where they feel that the ground is swaying beneath their feet even when it is not - a condition blamed on confused inner-ear balance receptors and a heightened state of anxiety.\u201d For the many people now living in evacuation centers, the horror of the disaster that destroyed their homes and caused the death of family members is relived with every aftershock. \u00a0 **Berkeley as a Ray of Hope** In the face of such devastating conditions, people around the world have mobilized to provide aid for Japan. Here at Berkeley, dozens of student organizations have been holding donation drives, and putting on events and showcases to raise money for the relief effort. A \u201cJapan Relief\u201d store that sold hand-crafted clothing, bags, jewelry, along with an array of pottery, second-hand items and baked goods, was set up on the corner of Telegraph and Parker. The funds raised at the store were sent to the Consulate of Japan in San Francisco. After raising over $20,000 in just four weeks, the store closed temporarily until further notice. The Cal Japan Club has organized a Relief Committee specifically designed to raise donations. The Relief Committee has joined up with the larger \u201cHope for Japan\u201d project, which is being lead by Students for Japan committees in universities and colleges across California. According to Hikari Kato, a member of the Relief Committee and a representative of Hope For Japan Project in Northern California \u201cThe purpose of the project is to enhance uniformity by raising the same slogan, sharing the same poster, sending the collected donations to Japanese Red Cross and sharing information among different campuses. By doing so, we expect to raise public awareness of the disaster and our activities.\u201d In addition to fundraising on Sproul on Mondays and Wednesdays, the Relief Committee has been collecting donations at Farmer\u2019s Markets around Berkeley and on the corner of Ashby and College on Fridays. Wristbands are also being sold for $2. Members of the Relief Committee are mostly international students from Japan, and they say that donating money to charity organizations is the best way for students to help the people in Japan. In an interview at the Farmer\u2019s Market on MLK and Center street, Relief Committee member Daiki Matsuura commented on Japan\u2019s history of earthquakes and the current situation in Japan: \u201cJapan is famous for earthquakes, we have been trying to prepare for this disaster but you can never prepare enough for this.\u201d Matsuura also said, \u201c[Hope for Japan\u2019s] goal is to raise $100,000, so far we have raised about $60,000. There are people around California involved in helping us.\u201d Another member, Hiro Ohisa, said that some of the strongest supporters donated over $100. According to Kato, the Berkeley students of the Cal Japan Club Relief Committee had raised $5,019.75 themselves as of April 14.

There were enough twitter posts making similar comments to make \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d a popular trending topic on Twitter. Hundreds of Facebook users posted similarly hurtful status updates.\r\n\r\nThese comments are so ridiculously ignorant, racist and spiteful that they don\u2019t even merit a well thought-out comeback, but immediately upon reading them I wanted to ask their writers if they remembered those two atomic bombs the great old red and white blue dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For the record, the combined death toll that resulted from the two bombs is conservatively estimated at 225,000, while the Pearl Harbor death toll is listed at 2,700 (11,000 fewer deaths than resulted from the earthquake and tsunami). Besides, there is no legitimacy in the notion of \u201ctaking revenge\u201d on an entire population of people for the actions of their government. And finally, how can one compare the motivation behind an act of war to an act of nature, which is completely apolitical and unmotivated?\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s more. On the March 14 airing of his radio show, Glenn Beck announced in his characteristically incoherent style, complete with obnoxious belly chuckle and all, that \u201cI\u2019m not saying God is, you know causing earthquakes\u2026But I\u2019ll tell\r\nyou this: There\u2019s a message being sent. And that is, \u2018Hey you know that stuff we\u2019re doing?\u2019 Not really working out real well. Maybe we should stop doing some of it. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite Beck\u2019s plain stupidity, many of his followers and equally ignorant and insensitive religious conservatives continued to offend the Christian faith by making similar statements. One girl\u2019s YouTube vlog in which she praised God for \u201cshaking\r\nJapan\u201d and waking up all the non-believers caused intense controversy and debate. A few days later the girl \u201ccame clean\u201d in another video where she stated that her comments were meant to be a joke. It doesn\u2019t even need to be said that something is seriously wrong when the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and the condition of families who are now homeless, jobless, hungry and traumatized are seen by some as appropriate topics for \u201cjokes.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Damage and Devastation<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTo gain a better sense of the ignorance and lack of humanity behind the \u201cJapan deserved it\u201d rhetoric, we need a complete picture of what the Japanese people have suffered since the quake. The 9.0 magnitude quake hit Japan on March 11, and generated a 10 meter high tidal wave that washed away houses, cars, infrastructure, people and even entire coastal villages. The search for more than 14,000 missing people continues among rubble. Hundreds and even thousands have been placed in evacuation shelters, where health resources and basic necessities are scarce.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Huffington Post, \u201cThe quake and tsunami also damaged the critical cooling system at the Fukushima\r\nDai-ichi plant, which overheated and began spewing radiation into the environment.\u201d As a result, radiation has been found in milk, water, and 11 types of vegetables grown in areas around the plant. Tokyo residents are storing up on bottled water and basic necessities, leaving supermarket shelves across the city bare. According to the Post, some supermarkets have even\r\nimposed a buying ration to prevent hoarding.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fears caused by radiation leaks, survivors of the quake also have to deal with the anxiety of aftershocks that continue to damage infrastructure. Hundreds of aftershocks, some measuring up to over 6.0 magnitude, have been reported in the five weeks since the quake.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aljazeera News, \u201cMany now complain of a queasy sensation where they feel that the ground is swaying beneath their feet even when it is not - a condition blamed on confused inner-ear balance receptors and a heightened state of anxiety.\u201d For the many people now living in evacuation centers, the horror of the disaster that destroyed their homes and caused the death of family members is relived with every aftershock.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Berkeley as a Ray of Hope<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn the face of such devastating conditions, people around the world have mobilized to provide aid for Japan. Here at Berkeley, dozens of student organizations have been holding donation drives, and putting on events and showcases to raise money for the relief effort. A \u201cJapan Relief\u201d store that sold hand-crafted clothing, bags, jewelry, along with an array of pottery, second-hand items and baked goods, was set up on the corner of Telegraph and Parker. The funds raised at the store were sent to the Consulate of Japan in San Francisco. After raising over $20,000 in just four weeks, the store closed temporarily until further notice.\r\n\r\nThe Cal Japan Club has organized a Relief Committee specifically designed to raise donations. The Relief Committee has\r\njoined up with the larger \u201cHope for Japan\u201d project, which is being lead by Students for Japan committees in universities and colleges across California.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hikari Kato, a member of the Relief Committee and a representative of Hope For Japan Project in Northern\r\nCalifornia \u201cThe purpose of the project is to enhance uniformity by raising the same slogan, sharing the same poster, sending the collected donations to Japanese Red Cross and sharing information among different campuses. By doing so, we expect to raise public awareness of the disaster and our activities.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to fundraising on Sproul on Mondays and Wednesdays, the Relief Committee has been collecting donations at\r\nFarmer\u2019s Markets around Berkeley and on the corner of Ashby and College on Fridays. Wristbands are also being sold for $2. Members of the Relief Committee are mostly international students from Japan, and they say that donating money\r\nto charity organizations is the best way for students to help the people in Japan.\r\n\r\nIn an interview at the Farmer\u2019s Market on MLK and Center street, Relief Committee member Daiki Matsuura commented on\r\nJapan\u2019s history of earthquakes and the current situation in Japan: \u201cJapan is famous for earthquakes, we have been trying to prepare for this disaster but you can never prepare enough for this.\u201d\r\n\r\nMatsuura also said, \u201c[Hope for Japan\u2019s] goal is to raise $100,000, so far we have raised about $60,000. There are people around California involved in helping us.\u201d Another member, Hiro Ohisa, said that some of the strongest supporters donated over $100. According to Kato, the Berkeley students of the Cal Japan Club Relief Committee had raised $5,019.75 themselves as of April 14.\r\n\r\nThe members of the relief committee were hopeful that they would reach their target goal of donations. When asked whether\r\nthey had experienced any negative attitudes toward Japan while fundraising, they said they had not. Overall, they expressed gratitude and optimism in response to the great support they have been receiving from the Berkeley community.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 23:29:39 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:03:01 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 23:29:39 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1501,"title":"Census Reports Asians: So What Does That Mean?","slug":"census-reports-asians-so-what-does-that-mean","markdown":"\nby **yifan zhang** Congratulations, the Asian American population grew 43.3 percent during the past decade, more than any other race, as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Most of this growth can be attributed to immigration, as the black and white populations grew by a mere 5.7 percent and 9.2 percent respectively. Despite the staggering growth in the past decade, the Asian American population remains nominally low: 4.8 percent for Asian Americans reported as a single race, and 5.6 percent for Asian Americans identifying as multiple races. The country is also composed of more minorities in general. The American minority population grew 28.8 percent, and 36 percent of America\u2019s population is considered a minority. In addition, every state in the Union reported increases in minority populations. Caveats and problems in census data collection, however, often muddle actual figures. For example, according to the census bureau, Hispanic is not a race. The box that you indicate Hispanic ancestry is before where you indicate your race, an entity deliberately made separate from ethnicity. , Setting Hispanic as an ethnic variable is important because the experiences, lifestyles, income, and social status of a \u201cwhite\u201d American and a white Hispanic American may often be different. The Hispanic population grew 43 percent in the past decade, similarly due to immigration. However, being Hispanic and being Asian are not mutually exclusive, as 0.4 percent of Asian Americans check the Latino box. Thus, there is a small overlap between the growth of the Hispanic population and Asian American population. This may cause miscounting as people do not know which ethnicity to identify with. Moreover, \u201cwhiteness\u201d also incorporates those of non-Europeans origins, such as Egyptians, Moroccans, and Turks. While many regard people from North Africa and the Middle East as exclusive from whites or even inclusive of Asians, the census bureau places them under the ambiguous category of white. However, people from Pakistan are explicitly included within the category of Asians. What about Persians? Having people of Middle Eastern descent under the category of whites lowers the recorded proportions of Asian Americans. These explicit racial categories set up by the U.S. Census Bureau often contradict intuitive racial definitions, leading to imprecise data. The distribution of Asian Americans is becoming increasingly uniform across the country. The downside of this is that Asian Americans become increasingly invisible socially and politically as they become more evenly distributed, thus leading to underrepresentation in state and national levels. The only counties in the nation reporting Asian Americans above 20 percent are San Francisco County, San Mateo County, Alameda County, Santa Clara County, Queens in New York and Middlesex County in New Jersey. Of them, only San Francisco County and Santa Clara County reported Asian American populations of over 30 percent. Even though Asian Americans are concentrated in these counties and send representatives on the local level, representation is a problem on the state and national level. Strong voting blocs at the local level can propel more Asian American representatives into office, but this dispersing of the Asian American population renders Asians and their concerns invisible on larger arenas. Figures at the county level, however, do not illustrate the emergence of Asian American neighborhoods across America. Although Asian Americans are moving inland, Asians still tend to coagulate in specific neighborhoods. Although Asian Americans take up a small percentage of the population on the county level, Asian Americans concentrate in certain neighborhoods in many metropolitan areas. For example, Cook County, which contains the city of Chicago, has a 6 percent Asian population. This may imply to politicians and other policy makers that very few Asians live in this region. However, a more detailed look at specific census tracts states otherwise. Census tracts in Skokie and Evanston show around 20 percent to 30 percent Asian American. In Chicago\u2019s Chinatown, the proportion of Asian Americans rises up to 89 percent in certain tracts. In order to include Asian Americans in the political process, we need to maintain a sense of national identity. All citizens should be introduced to the concept of E pluribus unum: out of many, one. On the other hand, the fabric of society must open up and be more inclusive of the increasing amounts of new ethnicities. Foremost, a correct and accurate portrait of the American population must be taken through the Census to illustrate ethnic diversity, that being \u201cAmerican\u201d is not synonymous with being \u201cwhite.\u201d Moreover, the government and the general media should portray a more realist depiction of the ethnic makeup of the nation. In addition, Asian Americans should hold more political offices in order to give more public attention to the Asian American community. The Census clearly shows Asian American communities blooming across the nation. However, if these communities are being fairly represented is another question: some are represented, some are not. Not only should Asian American be \u201cAmerican Asians,\u201d but America should be [at least partially] defined by Asian Americans through political representation. In other words, giving America an \u201cAsian\u201d face promotes the integration of Asian Americans into American society, limiting discrimination and hostility to peoples formerly thought of as \u201cforeign menaces.\u201d Interaction between Asian Americans and other communities have been beneficial for some Asian Americans. Asian American political representatives such as Mike Honda, Bobby Jindal, Gary Locke, and many others often portray themselves not as the \u201cethnic\u201d ticket but rather as inclusive of all of their constituents. In addition, these politicians also unofficially represent the Asian American communities they are coming from. Asian Americans can learn how to navigate the market by working with other ethnic communities. Korean shopkeepers often learn to respect their non-Korean customers rather than antagonize them. Asian American small business owners have learned not only to sell to your own community but also to others outside the community. Even something as simple as learning English can benefit Asian Americans. English could work as a lingua franca, allowing Asian Americans to bridge coalitions with other ethnic groups, including other Asians that don\u2019t share the same mother-tongue. Coalition building a la Third World Liberation would be much harder with language barriers. English as a bridge language thus encourages cooperation. As more Hispanics and Asian immigrants arrive, it is imperative that they are empowered through the use of language and politics. New arrivals give both challenges and opportunities for coalition building. However, coalition building and other forms of political empowerment can only arise if immigrant communities utilize tools at their disposal. Thus, it\u2019s important to have self determination within communities where they elect representatives that can represent their populations and bring them into the political fabric. Only then can Asian Americans be not only representatives of themselves but as a nation as a whole.\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>yifan zhang<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCongratulations, the Asian American population grew 43.3 percent during the past decade, more than any other race, as designated by the U.S. Census Bureau.

With the goal of saving $75 million annually through various cost-cutting measures, the Operational Excellence program emerged as an effort to deal with our budgetary deficit. With the staff cuts mandated through OE\u2019s Organizational Simplification initiative set to happen by the end of the academic year, it\u2019s difficult to predict the effects Operational Excellence\u2019s programs will have both campuswide and in localized settings. The Ethnic Studies Department is undergoing a series of changes and cuts mandated by OE that have generated many critical reactions from our students, staff and faculty. While grappling with the decisions handed down by Operational Excellence, however, it has been incredibly unclear who to communicate our grievances to and how to cut through the red tape of the program. OE\u2019s Organizational Simplification initiative, in their own words, \u201cwill provide faculty, students, and staff with a working environment that is both more efficient and more effective, and which promotes the growth and professional development of our staff.\u201d However, the recent decisions being executed make its moniker and mission statement seem euphemistic. Among the most controversial of decisions is the proposal to merge the administrative staffs of three departments \u2013 Ethnic, African American and Gender & Women\u2019s Studies. This merging is to be done concurrently with staff cuts across departments. These staff cuts include reducing Gender & Women\u2019s Studies\u2019 Student Affairs Officer and several Ethnic Studies department staff members to part-time, as well as outright layoffs. OE\u2019s Organizational Simplification initiative is cutting 2.5 full-time equivalent hours from the Ethnic Studies department this year \u2013 one FTE cut is a full-time position layoff while half of an FTE is a reduction from full-time to part-time employment. In this sense, FTE reductions underestimate staff losses, since half-time employment is not a sustainable option for some workers. Layoffs and time cuts are only the first round of consequences from OE\u2019s initiatives. The very motives of the Organizational Simplification program are obscured by their implementation. According to Dean Andrew Szeri, the faculty head for Operational Excellence, the restructuring initiative measured the quantitative ratio of workers to management and acted to create a ratio of six to one. This objective is contradicted by the layoffs across the Ethnic, African American and Gender & Women Studies departments, which primarily targeted non-managerial staff. In fact, many of the reductions targeted SAOs, who provide the vital service of recruiting and orienting new and first-generation students to the majors and our campus. In a meeting with a coalition of students, staff and faculty from the three departments, the Dean of the Social Science Division, Carla Hesse, indicated that all staff being laid off will be placed in a pool for preference hiring as new positions opened up, but this stipulation comes with no guarantees. OE staff have stressed that cuts through Organizational Simplification are being done equitably campuswide in an attempt to distribute the pain of budget cuts equally. Nominally, this seems like a fair strategy, but there is no staff representation from the Social Science or Humanities Division of the College of Letters & Science on the main Organizational Simplification Team. Although Deans from each division are consulted in the implementation of the initiative's decisions, the amount of influence they have on the decision-making process is all too ambiguous. Additionally, these cuts are being made under an ahistorical frame that elides the legacy of our departments. The imperative for struggle is clearly rooted in our departmental history. Asian American, African American, Chicano, Native American and Ethnic Studies programs were established through student strikes during the winter quarter of 1969. Not only are our departments relatively young as institutions, it has taken additional student and faculty struggles to simply maintain our departments. In response to budgetary and staff cuts, exacerbated by faculty attrition and the University\u2019s refusal to make new hires, to the Ethnic Studies department in the 1990s, students organized protests and hunger strikes in affiliation with the Third World Liberation Front, the organization that won the establishment of Ethnic Studies programs in 1969. The efforts of the movement secured some new faculty hires in the department and the eventual development of the multicultural community center. Cuts being carried out on the Ethnic Studies department must be considered within this broader context of struggle on behalf of students and the lack of institutional support for our department. Even more immediate, OE needs to take a less myopic approach in distributing cuts across departments. A 2.5 reduction in FTE staff is one of the largest cuts in the Social Science division, and it also does not take into consideration the two FTE staff that resigned last year. This constitutes a huge 4.5 FTE staff reduction in an already small department. How it came to this is unclear. Despite multiple meetings with different levels of OE staff, fingers are being twisted back and forth to indicate who passed the decisions down to whom, who made the final call, and what sort of advice they were given. Faculty members, such as Dean Hesse and Dean Szeri, involved in the implementation of the Organizational Simplification initiative have attended several open meetings held by stakeholders in the Ethnic, African American and Gender & Women Studies and the ASUC. It has remained thoroughly unclear, however, what person or level of staff could ameliorate the concerns of staff, students, and faculty. More critically, the concerns and criticisms from our departments have gone either unaddressed or crucially misunderstood. The metrics that were used to divine cuts to staff allegedly focused on increasing efficiency in staff and raising ratios of employee to management. In a meeting with the ASUC, Dean Szeri noted that many of Operational Excellence\u2019s programs were designed to optimize what he called the University\u2019s two main businesses: teaching and research. If teaching is one of the main businesses of the University, who is being taught? Which socioeconomic, racial and geographic groups are going to have access to this education if the staff that does critical work in recruiting a diverse campus are being laid off or put on part-time? Are current and future students going to receive the vital staff support they need to successfully navigate the University? The argument has been made several times to incorporate a metric that considers the field work that staff, faculty, and students of certain departments do, especially in the recruitment and retention of working class and underrepresented students of color. This metric \u2013 somewhat mislabeled as a \u201cdiversity metric\u201d \u2013 seems to be habitually misunderstood by OE personnel. This metric would not simply be a numerical tally of how many people of color are on staff or faculty, but assess hours that different departments and staff members contribute to hosting and participating in different outreach and recruitment programs and events, especially when these hours are done pro bono. The sheer struggle to get any definitive answers from OE personnel demonstrates the startling lack of transparency built into the program. The discourse around initiatives such as Organizational Simplification is that the whole University is undergoing cutbacks, and the entire campus will be taking blows. But the suggestion that each department is suffering from equivalent or equally proportional cutbacks is fallacious and completely obscures the constant litany of struggle that our departments\u2019 students, staff and faculty have had to endure. It also ignores the institutional stability of larger, older disciplines and completely disregards the work of our departments\u2019 staff in recruiting and retaining a diverse student population. The staff of the Organizational Simplification initiative isn\u2019t representative of our departments, or even our division. OE personnel, while giving staff, students and faculty multiple audience, have either misinterpreted our critiques or been callous to them. Layoffs are scheduled to take effect at the end of the academic term, and we are still looking for an answer.\n","html":"<em>The negative effects of Operational Excellence on the Ethnic Studies department.<\/em>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>\u201cRed tape, I can see, can\u2019t you see?\r\n...Red tape, killing you, killing me.\"\r\nCircle Jerks (1980)<\/em><\/p>\r\nby <strong>austin houlgate<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIn Fall 2009, UC Berkeley hired an outside consultant group, Bain &amp; Company,\u00a0to streamline the university and cut costs.

In this sense, FTE reductions underestimate staff losses, since half-time employment is not a sustainable option for some workers.\r\n\r\nLayoffs and time cuts are only the first round of consequences from OE\u2019s initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe very motives of the Organizational Simplification program are obscured by their implementation. According to Dean Andrew Szeri, the faculty head for Operational Excellence, the restructuring initiative measured the quantitative ratio of workers to management and acted to create a ratio of six to one. This objective is contradicted by the layoffs across the Ethnic, African American and Gender &amp; Women Studies departments, which primarily targeted non-managerial staff. In fact, many of the reductions targeted SAOs, who provide the vital service of\r\nrecruiting and orienting new and first-generation students to the majors and our campus.\r\n\r\nIn a meeting with a coalition of students, staff and faculty from the three departments, the Dean of the Social Science Division, Carla Hesse, indicated that all staff being laid off will be placed in a pool for preference hiring as new positions opened up, but this stipulation comes with no guarantees. OE staff have stressed that cuts through Organizational Simplification are being done equitably campuswide in an attempt to distribute the pain of budget cuts equally. Nominally, this seems like a fair strategy, but there is no staff representation from the Social Science or Humanities Division of the College of Letters &amp; Science on the main Organizational Simplification Team. Although Deans from each division are consulted in the implementation of the initiative's decisions, the amount of influence they have on the decision-making process is all too ambiguous. Additionally, these cuts are being made under an ahistorical frame that elides the legacy of our departments.\r\n\r\nThe imperative for struggle is clearly rooted in our departmental history. Asian American, African American, Chicano, Native American and Ethnic Studies programs were established through student strikes during the winter quarter of 1969. Not only are our departments relatively young\r\nas institutions, it has taken additional student and faculty struggles to simply maintain our departments. In response to budgetary and staff cuts, exacerbated by faculty attrition and the University\u2019s refusal to make new hires, to the Ethnic Studies department in the 1990s, students organized protests and hunger strikes in affiliation with the Third World Liberation Front, the organization that won the establishment of Ethnic Studies programs in 1969. The efforts of the movement secured some new faculty hires in the department and the eventual development of the multicultural community center.\r\n\r\nCuts being carried out on the Ethnic Studies department must be considered within this broader context of struggle on behalf of students and the lack of institutional support for our department. Even more immediate, OE needs to take a less myopic approach in distributing cuts across departments. A 2.5 reduction in FTE staff is one of the largest cuts in the Social Science division, and it also does not take into consideration the two FTE staff that resigned last year. This constitutes a huge 4.5 FTE staff reduction in an already small department. How it came to this is unclear. Despite multiple meetings with different levels of OE staff, fingers are being twisted back and forth to indicate who passed the decisions down to whom, who made the final call, and what sort of advice they were given.\r\n\r\nFaculty members, such as Dean Hesse and Dean Szeri, involved in the implementation of the Organizational Simplification initiative have attended several open meetings held by stakeholders in the Ethnic, African American and Gender &amp; Women Studies and the ASUC. It has remained thoroughly unclear, however, what person or level of staff could ameliorate the concerns of staff, students, and faculty. More critically, the concerns and criticisms from our departments have gone either unaddressed or crucially misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe metrics that were used to divine cuts to staff allegedly focused on increasing efficiency in staff and raising ratios of employee to management. In a meeting with the ASUC, Dean Szeri noted that many of Operational Excellence\u2019s programs were designed to optimize what he called the University\u2019s two main businesses: teaching and research. If teaching is one of the main businesses of the University, who is being taught? Which socioeconomic, racial and geographic groups are going to have access to this education if the staff that does critical work in recruiting a diverse campus are being laid off or put on part-time? Are current and future students going to receive the vital staff support they need to successfully navigate the University?\r\n\r\nThe argument has been made several times to incorporate a metric that considers the field work that staff, faculty, and students of certain departments do, especially in the recruitment and retention of working class and underrepresented students of color. This metric \u2013 somewhat\r\nmislabeled as a \u201cdiversity metric\u201d \u2013 seems to be habitually misunderstood by OE personnel. This metric would not simply be a numerical tally of how many people of color are on staff or faculty, but assess hours that different departments and staff members contribute to hosting and participating in different outreach and recruitment programs and events, especially when these hours are done pro bono.\r\n\r\nThe sheer struggle to get any definitive answers from OE personnel demonstrates the startling lack of transparency built into the program. The discourse around initiatives such as Organizational Simplification is that the whole University is undergoing cutbacks, and the entire campus will be taking blows. But the suggestion that each department is suffering from\r\nequivalent or equally proportional cutbacks is fallacious and completely obscures the constant litany of struggle that our departments\u2019 students, staff and faculty have had to endure. It also ignores the institutional stability of larger, older disciplines and completely disregards the work of our departments\u2019 staff in recruiting and retaining a diverse student population.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Organizational Simplification initiative isn\u2019t representative of our departments, or even our division. OE personnel, while giving staff, students and faculty multiple audience, have either misinterpreted our critiques or been callous to them. Layoffs are scheduled to take effect at the end of the academic term, and we are still looking for an answer.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:14:46 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:15:44 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:14:46 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1511,"title":"AAA Multicultural Dance Showcase","slug":"aaa-multicultural-dance-showcase","markdown":"\nby **adrian lee** The 1st Annual Asian American Association Multicultural Dance Showcase on April 21 was an entertaining show to watch on a warm Thursday night.

The video also sparked intense debate and controversy among UCLA students and administrators themselves. However, for anyone to assert that racist attitudes like Wallace\u2019s exist only on the UCLA campus would be a sadly na\u00efve mistake. UC San Diego\u2019s noose hangings and \u201cCompton Cookout\u201d party, the arrest, detainment and possible expulsion of 11 of UC Irvine\u2019s Arab students for non-violently protesting, the swastikas drawn on the walls of UC Berkeley\u2019s Clark Kerr last year, and finally the budget cuts and 2012 UC Admissions Policy that threaten to decrease enrollment of low income students of color, are all grave reminders that discrimination exists everywhere across the UC\u2019s and targets a wide variety of minority populations. As a result, we have come to think of racism on the UC\u2019s in terms of these regularly occurring incidents\u2014we rarely examine the age old institutions that actually manifest a structural and therefore more subliminal kind of racism. One such institution is the Greek Community at Cal. The website CollegeACB explicitly reveals the racial views of Berkeley students, particularly in the Greek Community. CollegeACB is a site which allows students to anonymously confess about \u201clife\u201d without the fear of recourse. \u201cEveryone has something that they\u2019re afraid to say out loud,\u201d the site\u2019s mission statement states. The goal is to use the anonymous confessions \u201cto improve your community without being an outcast.\u201d However, over time posts that comment on Greek life have come to dominate the site. Although some may dismiss the site as reflective of only a small microcosm of the Berkeley population, or simply another anonymous confession site, CollegeACB is notable because it is one of the few documentations of the negative stereotyping and racism that actually exists beneath the surface of the Greek scene at Berkeley. One particularly relevant aspect of the site is the way in which houses are \u201cranked.\u201d Website users group houses into \u201ctop tier,\u201d \u201cmiddle tier,\u201d and \u201clower tier.\u201d House rankings, as they are called on the site, are important to the reputations of the houses in the larger Greek Community. But what makes a house \u201ctop tier\u201d or \u201clower tier?\u201d According to the standard set by the site, \u201ctop houses\u201d are exclusive, haze their pledges, throw good parties, and have \u201cattractive\u201d members. With this standard a few houses are constantly thrown into the definition of a top houses while other houses are consistently ranked low for having, as one poster notes, - \u201c[\u2026] looser sandniggers and chinks.\u201d If one were to observe composites, which are photo yearbooks of members in a fraternity or sorority, of the supposed top houses, one thing is apparent \u2013 there are fewer minorities and more white, blond members in the \u201ctop houses.\u201d Often the tier system leads many of the top houses to stay exclusive to other top houses. Exchanges, which are exclusive parties between a fraternity and a sorority, are usually between houses of a similar tier ranking. As a result, there is rarely interaction between lower-tier and higher tier houses as having exchanges with lower-tier houses is socially looked down upon because the girls or guys are perceived to be less attractive. Historically, houses put clauses in their constitutions that explicitly banned recruitment of certain racial groups. As a result, racial-interest houses were made. At Berkeley, Pi Alpha Phi was the first Asian-interest fraternity to be created by Asian students who had been discriminated against and denied housing on the campus area. Today, no houses have explicit bans on recruiting members. However, the historical notion that people of the same racial group feel more comfortable around each other rather than people of other racial groups still remains embedded in the Greek structure. Fraternities and sororities are organizations that, by nature, are selective in their goal to create a \u201ccomfortable\u201d group whose members have certain similarities in interests and appearance. \u201cFraternities were designed to be exclusive toward a certain characteristic of people. It isn\u2019t a matter of racism but a matter of what many of the houses are comfortable with\u201d, Meshna said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, many of these houses pick people that are white because they think athletic, blond people are more attractive since they grew up with such thinking.\u201d Although individual members of the houses may not hold any racist attitudes whatsoever, and although they may claim to not be racist in their recruitment and exclusion of members, when they are abstracted into the larger structure of the Greek system and competing among others to make the \u201cbest\u201d house, certain subliminal preferences prevail. At the end of the day, many houses will only feel \u201ccomfortable\u201d living with you, and therefore deem you suitable for Greek life, if you have the look they want. Although it\u2019s true that the houses exist to create communities, the fact that members are recruited and excluded based partly on physical appearance is contradictory to the notion of community making. As mentioned earlier, Asian-interest houses were formed in the 19th century in response to the racism of the larger Greek Community. To a large extent, the Asian-interest houses still serve the function of providing a safe space for Asian American students who experience discrimination in the larger Greek and Berkeley communities. Sorority rankings on the site constantly show houses such as Gamma Phi Beta and Delta Delta Delta as lower houses because these houses have a large amount of Asian members, and as a result, words such as \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d often appear when describing these houses. As one CollegeACB poster remarked, \u201cThe hottest Asian girls here are for sure half white, no other full Asian chicks are hot.\u201d Jenny Tran, a member of an Asian-interest sorority, felt that she was looked down on by members of the top houses and sees her house as an alternative and welcoming space. \u201cI talked to a few girls from Panhellenic and I\u2019d say only one girl out of the 4 that I talked to actually had a conversation with me [while] others brushed me off,\u201d said Jenny Tran, a member of an Asian-interest sorority. \u201cI was flyered by an Asian sorority and they were nice to me and took the time to get to know me. Being in [my] house has opened a lot of doors for me. I\u2019ve met people I never thought I\u2019d be friends with. I\u2019m extremely close [\u2026] to everybody and it feels like a family.\u201d However, while ethnic-interest houses maynprovide necessary spaces for people who are excluded elsewhere, the only measure that will effectively break the Greek system out of the cycle of categorizing and discriminating against people based on race, is to have more interaction among various houses and diverse groups of people. If Berkeley truly wants to be a diverse school, as it prides itself of being, we must continue to have events between \u201cWhite,\u201d \u201cAsian,\u201d and all other ethnic-interest houses. I might sound idealistic but events by Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic Council (PHC), the main governing councils of fraternities and sororities that are often labeled as \u201cwhite\u201d houses, with the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) and National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) are a great step toward achieving the goal of breaking racial barriers between the councils. Greek Week is a week-long competition among fraternities and sororities as a medium to unite the Greek community. Greek Week is one of the few events that include all four councils. Other events such as the St.Jude\u2019s Letterwriting Philantrophy event in 2010 were another example of an event bringing together houses from all four councils with the common goal of philanthropy. With these types of events, the barriers between houses will decrease and people will become more comfort with each other. The improvement is already relevant in many of the houses in the Greek community. \u201cThere are definitely more Asians in the Greek community [outside of Asian houses],\u201d Meshna said. Only through interaction between all houses and all ethnic groups on-campus can we, as a society, eventually move on from structural and subliminal forms of racism, and break racial barriers.\n","html":"<em>Students' Perspective from both Inside and Out on Racial Barriers dividing Houses.<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>adrian lee<\/strong>\r\n\r\nJust hours after Alexandra Wallace posted her now infamous \u201cAsians in the Library\u201d video on\r\nYouTube, shocked university students across America began retaliating against her hurtfully ignorant comments, as well as the racism exhibited at UCLA.

Other\r\nevents such as the St.Jude\u2019s Letterwriting Philantrophy event in 2010 were another example of an event bringing together houses from all four councils with the common goal of philanthropy.\r\n\r\nWith these types of events, the barriers between houses will decrease and people will become more comfort with each other. The improvement is already relevant in many of the houses in the Greek community.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are definitely more Asians in the Greek community [outside of Asian houses],\u201d Meshna said.\r\n\r\nOnly through interaction between all houses and all ethnic groups on-campus can we, as a society, eventually move on from structural and subliminal forms of racism, and break racial barriers.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:51:09 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:51:09 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:51:09 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1528,"title":"Young Asian American Women: Under Double Pressure ","slug":"young-asian-american-women-under-double-pressure","markdown":"\nby **kristy soyeon kim** It is normal for people to have a bad day and feel anxious, sad, or fearful, but when these feelings persist for more than two weeks and begin to dominate your life, it becomes depression. When I found out that Asian American women ages 15 to 24 have the highest suicide rate among women of any race or ethnic group in that age group, I recalled the day when my Korean American friend gave me a tour of the UC Berkeley campus. When we arrived at the campanile, I enthusiastically took some pictures and asked if we could go up to the top. My friend, however, said, \u201cYou\u2019d better not go up. I heard that students jump from the top every year.\u201d \"Why?\" I asked. \"Who knows? Maybe because of stress from all the school work? Evans is infamous for suicide too. School authorities try to cover up the incidents, but it happens a lot.\" At the time, it seemed to me like an advance warning: Berkeley life won\u2019t always be rosy. Be prepared! According to the Department of Health and Human Services, Asian American women have the highest suicide rate among all women ages 15 to 24. Nearly 1,100 total suicides will occur on college campuses in America this year. Additionally, many more students will contemplate suicide and even go so far as to plan for it. In the past 50 years, the suicide rate for ages 15 to 24 has increased more than 200 percent. About 12 people in that age group will commit suicide today \u2013 that is one about every two hours. Eliza Noh, assistant professor of Asian American Studies at CSU Fullerton, is familiar with those sobering statistics. Noh\u2019s sister suffered from serious depression and killed herself in college. After her sister\u2019s death, Noh spent much of her professional life studying depression and suicide among Asian American women. Why is suicide the second leading cause of death for Asian American women in that age range? There are many complex reasons why young Asian American women have one of the highest suicide rates. First, Asian American college students in their twenties often deal with major academic pressures. After getting accepted into college, they are expected to excel academically so that they can ultimately land a professional job that guarantees money and stability. \"The model minority pressure is a huge factor,\" said Noh, who studied 41 Asian American women who had attempted or contemplated suicide. \"Sometimes it's very overt \u2013 parents say, 'You must choose this major or this type of job' or 'You should not bring home As and Bs, only As.\" Psychology studies have shown that women suffer from depression at higher rates than men. Dr. Dung Ngo, a psychologist at Baylor University in Texas, explains how gender issues combine with ethnic issues to put a twofold pressure on young Asian American women. According to Dr. Ngo, girls are more subject to family pressure than boys. \"When I go talk to high school students and ask them if they experience pressure, the majority who raised their hands were the girls,\" said Dr. Ngo. Asian American parents, he says, are stricter with girls than boys. \"The cultural expectations are that Asian women don't have that kind of freedom to hang out, to go out with friends, to do the kinds of things most teenagers growing up want to do. In addition, Asian American girls are under pressure to be the perfect mothers and daughters and wives as well. They are often expected to be super moms in their near future who would be dedicated to their family and work a full time job at the same time.\" Finally, fear of seeing a therapist can prevent many depressed Asian Americans from receiving help in time. Why are Asians less likely to seek therapy? Stanley Sue, a professor of Psychology and Asian American Studies at UC Davis, has studied suicide rates among Asian Americans. Sue told *Time* magazine in 2008 that \"Asian Americans are less likely than other groups to rely on mental health services, according to studies.\" According to her explanation, the reason is some services are very insensitive to the language and cultural nuances of various Asian groups, which is a major problem. In addition, in the Asian American community, a stigma is often attached to any discussion of personal problems. Seeking counseling can be seen as a public admission of a mental disorder. John Fong, interim director of Asian Community Mental Health Services in Oakland, said, \"Many young Asian Americans fail to get help, even when they are referred for counseling. Even the younger generation, which might be more Americanized, inherits the idea that if you or anyone in your family is seeing a therapist, the whole community is going to look down on you.\" A significant number of the high school students referred to the Oakland organization \u2013 by a parent, teacher or counselor \u2013 don't show up for their appointments. In addition, a 2005 Asian American Psychological Association study on the use of counseling services by university students of color showed that when Asian Americans do come in for counseling, they show a higher level of psychological distress compared to other groups. This is likely due to their reluctance to meet with a counselor. And Asian Americans spent the least amount of time in treatment \u2013 two sessions, on average \u2013 relative to other groups. In my opinion, these studies demonstrate the necessity to develop more \"culturally competent\" mental health services. What can we do to prevent suicide due to depression in young Asian American women? I think the school should stop avoiding suicide issues on campus and take the initiative to help students who are in need. There are many students struggling with depression who cannot turn to their family, friends or therapists for help. If colleges provide a platform for young Asian American women to talk about depression in a natural setting, they might be more willing to ask for help. For instance, at Cornell University, 13 of the 21 student suicide victims between 1996 and 2006 were Asian or Asian American. That picture is not complete unless you consider that Asians make up only 14 percent of the total Cornell student body. Cornell was so concerned that in 2002 it formed a special Asian and Asian American Campus Climate Task Force to look into the reason behind the high number of suicides. The university convened a mental health and welfare council and, to foster a sense of community, created a team of administrators, campus police, residence life staff and counselors who met weekly to discuss signs of student distress. The counseling center also trained faculty and staff \u2013 from custodians to department secretaries \u2013 to recognize and report worrisome student behavior. Statistics suggest Cornell's program is working. Several years since these initiatives began, Cornell has not had a single suicide on the campus. The fun parts of spring semester, such as spring break and Cal Day, have already passed. Finals and papers are creeping in. This is the time to realize that college life is not easy. Our remaining school days will be full of deadlines. However, don\u2019t be afraid, you are not alone! We are all in the same boat! Remember, even though you feel stressed out, you do not have to let negative emotions overwhelm you and make you spiral into depression. Try your best to maintain a positive mindset and, if it doesn\u2019t work, do not hesitate to ask for help from those around you. If you feel uncomfortable speaking your mind to the people close to you, get some support from professional services. Students facing depression or contemplating suicide should call: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-TALK (8255) 1-800-SUICIDE (784-2433) Asian LifeNet Hotline 1-877-990-8585 Help is available 24 hours a day.

Crisis can very well bring out the best in some people, but can also bring out the worst in others. We\u2019ve often cited the example of the aftermath of the Sept. 11th attacks on the World Trade Center as being a shining moment of American unity in the face of a national tragedy. Unfortunately, the light of this nationalism has blinded us to the reality of the hate and suspicion that runs rampant through our society. It\u2019s gotten to the point where baseless accusations made by public officials against Muslim and Arab Americans gain applause by people considered to be \u201ctrue Americans.\u201d As many may be aware, the most recent case of this involves Congressman Peter King who is the representative of New York\u2019s third district as well as the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. On March 10th, King began what will be a series of congressional hearings entitled \u201cThe Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and that Community\u2019s Response.\u201d According to King, the purpose of these hearings will be to root out the cause of Islamic radicalization within the Muslim community. Sadly, his approach to this issue is wrong on so many different levels. It doesn\u2019t require a very large stretch of the imagination to realize that Muslim Americans are perceived as one of the most distrusted groups in the United States. However, according to an article in the *Christian Science Monitor*, attitudes toward Muslim Americans are sharply polarized and divided by party lines. Older, conservative Republicans tend to be much more wary of Muslims than younger Democrats (Did I mention that Peter King is an old, conservative Republican?). To me, these congressional hearings aren't an attempt to deal with issues that threaten all Americans, but rather an insincere revival of the boogeyman of Islamic fundamentalism so this congressman can get his 15 minutes of fame. And with roughly half the U.S. population having an unfavorable view toward Islam, it isn\u2019t very difficult to get attention with his fear-mongering tactics. Within this atmosphere of suspicion, the holding of congressional hearings that targets only Muslim Americans is completely unproductive, for a number of reasons. As succinctly put by columnist Clive Crook, \u201ccongressional hearings are often more about politicians thrusting themselves into the news and parading pre-cooked opinions than discovering new information.\u201d King\u2019s initial hearing was no different. Instead of creating a space that promotes productive dialogue on an issue that may actually have relevance to the safety of all Americans, King has done nothing but put on a theatrical performance in which the only actors allowed on stage are those that agree with his preconceived notions of what the Muslim American community is doing. The fact that no Muslim American community leaders or experts on counter-terrorism have been allowed to testify at the hearing is evidence enough for me that representative King has no real interest in solving problems. Instead, King merely continues to spout his baseless accusations that Muslim Americans aren\u2019t doing enough work to prevent the radicalization of members in their community. For the record, research from two universities in North Carolina have found that Muslim Americans are the largest source of tips that have stopped terrorist plots within the United States since Sept. 11th. But wait, there\u2019s more! Not only is King\u2019s hearing unproductive, it\u2019s downright discriminatory. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize that a congressional hearing that deals with only the radicalization of the Muslim American community is little more than profiling and stereotyping. Extremism is an issue regardless of what community you belong to and is an issue that deserves our attention and commitment. Unfortunately, by singling out one group for radicalization and implying that only Muslims are capable of extremist activity, not only do you turn a blind eye to a whole range of potential threats but you also further alienate a group that has already been stigmatized by a large number of the public. How could anyone be expected to cooperate with authority figures when they live in a society that marks them as guilty before they have even done something wrong? The effect is doubled by the fact that the perpetuation of this folly is then internalized by most Americans; ironically resulting in the radicalization of the mainstream public\u2019s perception of Muslim Americans. Moving away from the nature of the hearing and the social context to which it is located, it is also important to look at King himself. While the topic of Islamic extremism and its effect within American communities may not be considered bigoted, I have no reservations in making the same claims against the man behind the hearings himself. King may like using his status as the representative of Long Island, New York as evidence of his personal connection to the 9\/11 attacks, but he blatantly gives himself away through statements such as, \u201cWe have, unfortunately, too many mosques in this country,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ve got to profile these fellas [of Middle Eastern descent].\u201d These bigoted comments are further exacerbated by the insultingly weak hedging and hypocritical line he made stating, \u201cThe overwhelming majority of Muslims are outstanding Americans\u2026\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why are you accusing the entire community of not doing enough to combat extremism? Personally I want to know what representative King himself does to combat extremism. Finally, the icing on the cake to all this is that King actually has a history of sympathizing with the Irish Republican Army, which many consider to be a terrorist organization. However, when called out on his affiliation with the IRA, King claimed the IRA has never attacked Americans and that his loyalty was to the United States. So it\u2019s not terrorism if it doesn\u2019t happen to Americans, huh Congressman King? WhileTablet Magazine may claim that this \u201chypocrisy is heinous, but it is not proof of wrongness,\u201d it sure doesn\u2019t do much to help King\u2019s argument. While I would be lying through my teeth if I said that this and other stupid shit like this didn\u2019t make me angry, anger isn\u2019t the most poignant emotion I feel about this whole situation. As pissed and frustrated as I am about draconian policies and hateful rhetoric, more than anything else, I just feel sad. Are our collective memories so poor and selective that we\u2019ve already forgotten that this has happened before? As much as I\u2019d hate to bring up the obvious analogy of Japanese internment, it seems I have to because the American public can\u2019t be held accountable to recall its own history. Following Pearl Harbor, and even before it, paranoia and racist sentiment culminated in Executive Order 9066, which was ultimately government-sanctioned profiling. These days, we\u2019re getting ever-closer to making the same mistake that President Ford once said \u201cshall never be repeated.\u201d While all hell hasn\u2019t completely broken loose yet, it is impossible to deny that hostility toward and the scapegoating of Muslim Americans has been on a steady incline. When political leaders are tolerant of discriminatory and racist actions and policies, then you know that it is not inconceivable for someone to do something extremely drastic, stupid and dangerous. Right now, the only thing that gives me hope is that there is a community out there that is determined to not allow history to repeat itself. Jan. 30th was the first Fred Korematsu Day of Civil Liberties and the Constitution, and being there made me realize that there are people who haven\u2019t forgotten, who can link the present and the future to the past and who will fight the tyranny that Peter King tries desperately to promote.\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>jeffrey pu<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s often said that times of crisis bring people together; however, a good friend of mine has recently made what I feel to be a very wise revision of this old adage.

These days, we\u2019re getting ever-closer to making the same mistake that President Ford once said \u201cshall never be repeated.\u201d While all hell hasn\u2019t completely broken loose yet, it is impossible to deny that hostility toward and the scapegoating of Muslim Americans has been on a steady incline. When political leaders are tolerant of discriminatory and racist actions and policies, then you know that it is not inconceivable for someone to do something extremely drastic, stupid and dangerous.\r\n\r\nRight now, the only thing that gives me hope is that there is a community out there that is determined to not allow history to repeat itself. Jan. 30th was the first Fred Korematsu Day of Civil Liberties and the Constitution, and being there made me realize that there are people who haven\u2019t forgotten, who can link the present and the future to the past and who will fight the tyranny that Peter King tries desperately to promote.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 10:11:32 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 17:35:45 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 26 Apr 2011 10:11:32 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1545,"title":"NPR Under Attack","slug":"npr-under-attack","markdown":"\n*Public Broadcasting Caught in the Middle of Partisan Politics* by **eric soohoo** On March 17th, the House of Representatives voted 228-192 to defund National Public Radio, in addition to making it unlawful for local public radio stations to purchase content from NPR with federal funds.

With China\u2019s economy and GDP skyrocketing past America\u2019s stagnant ones (who also happens to owe the former $1.16 trillion), the problem with China is not only that it is America\u2019s biggest economic threat, but it\u2019s that China apparently has the manipulative, ninja-like ability to infuse their entire population with the fiery red blood of communism.

But then when you actually learn about the program, it doesn\u2019t sound that bad. The program itself is taught by accredited American teachers and provides resources to those who may not have access to the Chinese language and culture. Like the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the program\u2019s purpose is to promote a better understanding and knowledge of the country, much in the same way that countries like France, Spain, Italy, and Germany \u2013 all countries whose cultures are highly supported by the U.S. \u2013 do. The \u201cConfucius Classroom,\u201d named after China\u2019s most famous philosopher whose global image exudes wisdom and grace and is arguably one of China's \u201ctoken\u201d things to know, isn\u2019t even a new or revolutionary idea. These language programs have already been successfully implemented throughout various educational institutions, ranging from elementary to university level, worldwide. And it\u2019s not like the Chinese government actually gives grants away to schools at random: schools must apply to the Hanban-Asia Society and go through a long, rigorous process involving proposals, budgets, and recommendations outlining their future Chinese language and culture program to even be considered in the first place. Hacienda Heights is a town east of downtown Los Angeles with a 59 percent non-white population. Despite the fact that the majority of families are of Chinese and Taiwanese descent and the school board consists predominantly of Asian Americans, the town nevertheless has been plagued by racist sentiments and ignorant views stemming from the nativism of those who arrived pre-1970s, before immigration quotas were relaxed. In the 1980s, there was huge opposition from the non-Asian American community against the building of a Taiwanese Buddhist temple (which was eventually built) over fears of savage, ritualistic animal sacrifices. History has shown us the consequences of an economic recession, and this incidence at Hacienda Heights is only the tip of a greater, more troubling iceberg. If the sponsor had been any other foreign government, the program wouldn't have been such a big issue. But regardless of whether it was China or not, I doubt that it would have caused such a large ruckus if the U.S. wasn\u2019t in such a state of economic ruin and confusion. Desperate times often call for desperate measures, and it is often when things are at their lowest that people begin to question motives and assume the worst. I say let\u2019s welcome the Chinese government\u2019s vested interest in our nation\u2019s children. The children are our future, and the future is a multilingual, global one. Our children need to learn to combat ignorance and bigotry with a cross-cultural education that will expand their understanding and appreciation of other countries.

We also looked at the inevitable \"Do I have enough RAM?\" question that pops up in every computer's life. But how do you know if it's working right, and what do you do if it isn't? Memory has a trait that's both good and bad. Good: if it's defective, your computer will have problems almost immediately, and you won't be able to ignore it. Bad: It's not always easy to figure out if the memory is the problem. In any case, if you figure out your memory is defective, replace it; there's just no fixing it. Here are some symptoms to look for. Blue Screen of Death (or BSOD); If you've been using a computer for any length of time, odds are you've seen a BSOD, or at least heard of it. It's a dreaded thing to most people because it often means something catastrophic happened to Windows that made it halt everything it was doing and stop (in fact, they used to be called STOP errors). The blue screen itself won't tell you much, but look for an error code that starts with 0x. Put that code into a search engine, and you'll find some more detail on just what the error means. The blue screen might even reference the memory outright. That usually means there was a problem either reading or writing information in memory. It could be a physical defect [perde](http:\/\/www.perdedekorasyon.com \"perde\"), or it could be a software problem. Windows errors; Though less dramatic than the BSOD, bad memory can also cause Windows error messages to popup frequently. Again, note any codes or references to memory. Copy down the exact message, put it in your favourite search engine, and see what comes of it. The computer won't boot up; This is a common one. Luckily, most systems can tell if the memory has a problem at boot time. You'll often hear a beep sequence, and a message will show on the screen. The message would usually be more informative than the BSOD one, so read carefully. Ok, so it looks like the memory is bad. Now what? The above steps are a general guide, not a be-all, end-all of memory troubleshooting. But if you do determine through observation and research that you're having memory trouble, here's a good chain of events to follow. DISCLAIMER: These steps involve opening up your PC and handling the hardware. This can void your warranty. It can also be dangerous if not done safely. I am not responsible for any negative results (though if you do it right, you shouldn't have any). ALWAYS turn off the power, and unplug the computer before adjusting the hardware. If in doubt, consult a technician. Troubleshooting RAM modules; Most modern computers have more than one memory stick in them (you can see what RAM slots look like here, with and without RAM in them). Remove one stick, and power up the computer. Still having the same problem? Try one of the other sticks. When you have removed a stick of RAM and the problem goes away, then you know that the troublemaker is either the stick of RAM you just took out, or the slot it was inserted into (we'll call them the suspect slot and RAM for now). Re-insert the suspect stick of RAM in the suspect slot. If the problem returns, try putting the suspect stick of RAM into a different slot. Still having problems? Then that stick of RAM is faulty. No problems? Then the suspect slot is the likely culprit. In this case, you'll have to avoid using the slot, or get a new motherboard. If you can't get the problem to go away with any combination of RAM\/slots, then you're looking at either a) a bad motherboard b) multiple bad sticks of RAM or slots or c) not a RAM problem at all.\n\n\n","html":"Last time, we covered what memory (or RAM) is, and what it does. We also looked at the inevitable \"Do I have enough RAM?\" question that pops up in every computer's life. But how do you know if it's working right, and what do you do if it isn't?\r\n\r\nMemory has a trait that's both good and bad. Good: if it's defective, your computer will have problems almost immediately, and you won't be able to ignore it. Bad: It's not always easy to figure out if the memory is the problem. In any case, if you figure out your memory is defective, replace it; there's just no fixing it. Here are some symptoms to look for.\r\n\r\nBlue Screen of Death (or BSOD); If you've been using a computer for any length of time, odds are you've seen a BSOD, or at least heard of it. It's a dreaded thing to most people because it often means something catastrophic happened to Windows that made it halt everything it was doing and stop (in fact, they used to be called STOP errors). The blue screen itself won't tell you much, but look for an error code that starts with 0x. Put that code into a search engine, and you'll find some more detail on just what the error means. The blue screen might even reference the memory outright. That usually means there was a problem either reading or writing information in memory. It could be a physical defect <a title=\"perde\" href=\"http:\/\/www.perdedekorasyon.com\">perde<\/a>, or it could be a software problem.\r\n\r\nWindows errors; Though less dramatic than the BSOD, bad memory can also cause Windows error messages to popup frequently. Again, note any codes or references to memory. Copy down the exact message, put it in your favourite search engine, and see what comes of it.\r\n\r\nThe computer won't boot up; This is a common one. Luckily, most systems can tell if the memory has a problem at boot time. You'll often hear a beep sequence, and a message will show on the screen. The message would usually be more informative than the BSOD one, so read carefully.\r\n\r\nOk, so it looks like the memory is bad. Now what?\r\nThe above steps are a general guide, not a be-all, end-all of memory troubleshooting. But if you do determine through observation and research that you're having memory trouble, here's a good chain of events to follow.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: These steps involve opening up your PC and handling the hardware. This can void your warranty. It can also be dangerous if not done safely. I am not responsible for any negative results (though if you do it right, you shouldn't have any). ALWAYS turn off the power, and unplug the computer before adjusting the hardware. If in doubt, consult a technician.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting RAM modules; Most modern computers have more than one memory stick in them (you can see what RAM slots look like here, with and without RAM in them). Remove one stick, and power up the computer. Still having the same problem? Try one of the other sticks. When you have removed a stick of RAM and the problem goes away, then you know that the troublemaker is either the stick of RAM you just took out, or the slot it was inserted into (we'll call them the suspect slot and RAM for now). Re-insert the suspect stick of RAM in the suspect slot. If the problem returns, try putting the suspect stick of RAM into a different slot. Still having problems? Then that stick of RAM is faulty. No problems? Then the suspect slot is the likely culprit. In this case, you'll have to avoid using the slot, or get a new motherboard. If you can't get the problem to go away with any combination of RAM\/slots, then you're looking at either a) a bad motherboard b) multiple bad sticks of RAM or slots or c) not a RAM problem at all.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":55,"created_at":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 13:04:42 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 13:04:42 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":1575,"title":"Statement by UC Berkeley DREAM Act Student Ju Hong","slug":"statement-by-uc-berkeley-dream-act-student-ju-hong","markdown":"\n**STATEMENT BY JU HONG****UC BERKELEY DREAM ACT STUDENT***\u201cIf not us, then who?

On Tuesday, July 12, six other undocumented students and I conducted an act of civil disobedience to empower young undocumented immigrant youth and to protest the inhuman treatments of immigrants.

After our arrest, we were held in jail for almost 12 hours. All seven of us were confined to a single cell room with one toilet, one roll of toilet paper, and two long wooden benches.

However, I have decided to stand up and fight back. I am sick and tired of remaining silent. Today, I am proclaiming to the world that I am undocumented and unafraid. In the next couple of weeks, I will find out if ICE will start removal proceedings on our cases. If ICE decides to put me in deportation proceedings, I will take full action and I will fight until I regain my basic human rights.

He graduated a year early from high school with a 4.3 GPA and was accepted to all the UCs he applied for, including UC Berkeley, but he chose to attend a community college instead. The reason? As an undocumented student, he was ineligible for any financial aid.<\/span>\n\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">It sucks to have a dream, but you can\u2019t follow it because of money,\u201d said Regem.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">At the age of six, Regem and his family immigrated to the United States from the Philippines with a traveler\u2019s visa. Once in the U.S., the family filed paperwork for citizenship on numerous occasions, but the lawyers repeatedly lost their paperwork, and their visa eventually expired.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">This is just one of many stories from the small population of undocumented students in our state. AB 540 students, those who are undocumented yet qualify for in-state tuition, are raised in American culture, speak English fluently and graduate from accredited high schools. With their parents\u2019 country of origin just a faint childhood memory, most AB 540 students consider America their real home. <\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Despite being de facto community members of California, AB 540 students face a serious obstacle on their path to higher education: financing it. With no access to aid, many undocumented students find themselves paying their way entirely through college, and until recently, were paying out-of-state fees, a tuition of $60,000 for those who mostly come from low-income families. <\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">However, the recent passage of AB 130 and 131 is setting a new precedent in California this year by allowing undocumented students to apply for both private scholarships and public aid to help fund their education. AB 130\u2019s effects are unfortunately limited by the scarce amount of private scholarships offered. The more contentious of the two bills, AB 131, allows undocumented students to apply for public aid, such as Cal grants, which would greatly shoulder the burden of costs and offer a much wider scope of aid than AB 130. <\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">And this is where the trouble begins.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Many Californians are revolted by the idea of using taxpayer money to fund \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d feeling these people don\u2019t belong in the U.S. in the first place. They feel all available funds should be prioritized towards citizens already struggling to pay for college due to the \u201cfact\u201d that there is simply no money to be given away in these tough economic times. People are also skeptical about educating \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d to compete for the diminishing number of white collar jobs in California they can\u2019t legally apply for. The \u201cobjectivists\u201d make it seem that this is a bad deal for all citizens.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">But is it?<\/span>\n\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">These people are ignorant of the issues and blame all these problems on immigrants, when immigrants aren\u2019t the reason for the problem in the first place. Do their research. All citizens will get their fair share. AB 540 students will receive aid after everyone else does,\u201d said Regem.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">They\u2019re not simply given the money. These students pay taxes, work hard in school, and sign affidavits saying they will undergo obtaining legal citizenship. Nonimmigrant aliens (those with active visas) have no such options.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Plus, the UC system has been struggling with budget cuts for several years, compiled with a dysfunctional state continually cutting revenues both for itself and its colleges. If anything, California\u2019s inability to raise revenue due to a hostile Republican party is a bigger contributing factor to the decline of higher education than approximately 1,620 undocumented students in the entire UC system. <\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Yet the criticisms are endless. Many are illustrative of the fear Americans have over their own future and their children\u2019s future in a time of growing economic uncertainty.

He graduated a year early from high school with a 4.3 GPA and was accepted to all the UCs he applied for, including UC Berkeley, but he chose to attend a community college instead. The reason? As an undocumented student, he was ineligible for any financial aid.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">It sucks to have a dream, but you can\u2019t follow it because of money,\u201d said Regem.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">At the age of six, Regem and his family immigrated to the United States from the Philippines with a traveler\u2019s visa. Once in the U.S., the family filed paperwork for citizenship on numerous occasions, but the lawyers repeatedly lost their paperwork, and their visa eventually expired.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">This is just one of many stories from the small population of undocumented students in our state. AB 540 students, those who are undocumented yet qualify for in-state tuition, are raised in American culture, speak English fluently and graduate from accredited high schools. With their parents\u2019 country of origin just a faint childhood memory, most AB 540 students consider America their real home. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Despite being de facto community members of California, AB 540 students face a serious obstacle on their path to higher education: financing it. With no access to aid, many undocumented students find themselves paying their way entirely through college, and until recently, were paying out-of-state fees, a tuition of $60,000 for those who mostly come from low-income families. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">However, the recent passage of AB 130 and 131 is setting a new precedent in California this year by allowing undocumented students to apply for both private scholarships and public aid to help fund their education. AB 130\u2019s effects are unfortunately limited by the scarce amount of private scholarships offered. The more contentious of the two bills, AB 131, allows undocumented students to apply for public aid, such as Cal grants, which would greatly shoulder the burden of costs and offer a much wider scope of aid than AB 130. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">And this is where the trouble begins.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Many Californians are revolted by the idea of using taxpayer money to fund \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d feeling these people don\u2019t belong in the U.S. in the first place. They feel all available funds should be prioritized towards citizens already struggling to pay for college due to the \u201cfact\u201d that there is simply no money to be given away in these tough economic times. People are also skeptical about educating \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d to compete for the diminishing number of white collar jobs in California they can\u2019t legally apply for. The \u201cobjectivists\u201d make it seem that this is a bad deal for all citizens.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">But is it?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">These people are ignorant of the issues and blame all these problems on immigrants, when immigrants aren\u2019t the reason for the problem in the first place. Do their research. All citizens will get their fair share. AB 540 students will receive aid after everyone else does,\u201d said Regem.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">They\u2019re not simply given the money. These students pay taxes, work hard in school, and sign affidavits saying they will undergo obtaining legal citizenship. Nonimmigrant aliens (those with active visas) have no such options.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Plus, the UC system has been struggling with budget cuts for several years, compiled with a dysfunctional state continually cutting revenues both for itself and its colleges. If anything, California\u2019s inability to raise revenue due to a hostile Republican party is a bigger contributing factor to the decline of higher education than approximately 1,620 undocumented students in the entire UC system. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">Yet the criticisms are endless. Many are illustrative of the fear Americans have over their own future and their children\u2019s future in a time of growing economic uncertainty. It is understandable that people would be apprehensive about government spending. What is not understandable, however, are the defamatory remarks, thinly-veiled racism and obnoxious distortions made to scare people into dismissing the undocumented students\u2019 issues.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\">We would be idiots to ignore the plight of the undocumented.

Implying that the Polish community likewise has no right to post Polish signs in their ethnic economy despite their white privilege, Koo argues that immigrant communities of any background should not impose their native languages in their communities and alienate customers.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Of course, Koo also conveniently ignores the fact that English itself is an immigrant language, and its monopolized use would alienate almost a quarter of New Yorkers who are limited English proficient (LEP).<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">As reported this summer, Koo aims to enforce a 1933 law that requires signs to be at least 60 percent English. Known as the \u201cMayor of Flushing\u201d due to his influence and history of civic engagement in the largely Asian neighborhood, Koo represents a district that encompasses some of the most heavily concentrated Asian areas in New York.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">English-only laws are historical and widely recognizable tactics for the suppression of immigrant communities of color. However, this instance has garnered particular attention because Koo and his supporter, Flushing Assemblywoman Grace Meng, are Asian Americans and insiders to the community in which they plan to enact this law.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">But the fact that these are yellow faces pushing this bill changes nothing. Koo's law is a racist piece of legislation, and the fact that he is a \u201cproud Chinese American\u201d (as stated by the *New York Times*) doesn't make it any less racist. In fact, it creates an even more harmful situation since Koo flaunts his identity and heritage to sugarcoat his inherently racist agenda.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The enforcement of this legislation is racist in both theory and practice. The law is fundamentally racist and xenophobic because it forces immigrants of diverse backgrounds to conform to English as a normative cultural standard. It implies that the manner in which this diverse community of color (which includes many Latino, Indian, and European immigrants as well as Chinese and Koreans) has organized themselves and their ethnic economies for essentially the past three decades is wrong.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Of course, this is not a practice endemic to New York. English-only legislation has been historically used to keep down growing communities of Asian Americans with increasing economic or political power and symbolically exclude them. The English-only controversy of the 1980s in Southern California's Monterey Park, for example, was an infamous period of anti-Asian racism during which white policymakers and residents tried to pass a similar bill under the guise of \u201cpublic safety\u201d (i.e. making sure firemen can identify where to go when they are fighting fires). According to Timothy Fong, author of *The First Suburban Chinatown*, when Mayor Lily Lee Chen tried to compromise, she was met with outrage from white residents, wh0 affirmed that the law was intentionally malicious, existed to keep the community from foreign influences, and grew out of resentment over Chinese Americans \u201ctaking over\u201d their city.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">In practice, the law is racist in Flushing because the business owners affected will principally be Asian American, who would be forced to gratuitously spend money on new signage. More notably, however, the targeted parties are low-to-middle income Asian American small business owners, who primarily run ethnic-serving enterprises that necessitate Asian language signs.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Interestingly, Koo's own background is in small business. But as the millionaire owner and CEO of the Flushing-based Starside Drugs chain, which directly competes with many of the firms the law targets, it is dubious whether he still identifies with or understands the financial situations lower-income small business owners face. As APA For Progress also points out, Koo's store also \u201calienates non-Asian residents,\u201d considering it displays its Chinese name on its storefront. The main difference, however, is that Koo has the resources to make the necessary renovations.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Though championed as their representative, Koo is NOT an advocate for the API community in Flushing and should not be regarded as such. In all media coverage of this issue as well as in his official City Council profile, Koo pimps out his humble beginnings. As an immigrant himself from Hong Kong, Koo repeatedly emphasizes that he worked his way up from minimum wage fast food jobs, ostensibly to convey that he can identify with his community. Nevertheless, it obfuscates the fact that he as a millionaire businessman no longer has a direct stake in the interests of the API small business constituency, and thus may not advocate for them.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">That Koo seems to care more about the needs of community outsiders is similarly suspicious and disconcerting. According to Asian Americans for Equality, 42 percent of Flushing's population is Asian American. Sixty percent of Asian New Yorkers are LEP with 42.5 percent being linguistically isolated, and Flushing has one of the highest rates of linguistic isolation in the city. This illustrates that the community requires signs to be chiefly written in their language. In fact, as many pictures of Flushing businesses indicate, there is English on signs; it's just not the most salient writing because the primary clientele of Asian businesses are Asian immigrants.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The prioritization of community outsiders' needs is thus troubling, as it engenders conditions conducive to gentrification, displacement, and other injurious situations faced by people of color in large urban centers.

Just because Koo (and other API politicians, bosses, people in power, etc.) is Asian doesn't mean he's a friend to the API community; in fact, it's even worse because he's API and has turned his back on his own community.

API activists in all communities should take this as a lesson to critically examine the leaders we support and ensure their commitment to furthering opportunity and equality for ALL APIs, not just the ones who abuse their influences in their own communities to gain power.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 09:54:47 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 10:17:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 09:54:47 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1663,"title":"The Writing on the Wall","slug":"the-writing-on-the-wall","markdown":"\nby **hai minh**\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">In Feb. 2010, my buddy \u201c5hadows\u201d and I rolled up to the run-down <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Long Bien<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> neighborhood in Hanoi, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Vietnam<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> on his old charcoal-colored Soviet Minsk motorcycle, sputtering and spewing its way along dusty roads filled with kids, occasional chickens, honking horns and mud splatters.

The selling point of the film is their intimate friendship, which blossoms into a sapphic affair. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The film captures the vibrancy and spirit of contemporary Tehran well. The conservative Islamic state is obviously against all the rebellious things kids do these days, but these repressive social institutions are handled with care, making the film solid sociopolitical commentary without being too heavy-handed. The chemistry between Atafeh and Shireen, played by Iranian-American newcomers Nikohl Boosheri and Sarah Kazemy respectively, is electric due to their expressive looks and sensual physicality. Boosheri and Kazemy are raw, authentic, and versatile; and not to mention, these ladies are stunners. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yet, while Atafeh and Shireen's relationship is intense and their lesbian romance is definitely the film\u2019s centerfold, it's treated rather tangentially in light of how Mehran, Atafeh's rehabilitated junkie brother (played by Rezo Sixo Safai), imposes his newfound fundamentalist values on his otherwise intellectually liberal family with disquieting gravitas. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">For the sake of not spoiling the film, I'm just going to say the plot development left much to be desired. Perhaps, viewers are supposed to feel a little wanting because almost every character in *Circumstance* feels they are missing out on something due to the rigid rules of their society. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Regardless of artistic intentions though, the portrayal of Atafeh and Shireen's relationship felt a little problematic. While it is apparent from the beginning that Shireen loves Atafeh, Atafeh seems as if she is just fulfilling her duties as Shireen's emotional pillar. It is clear that Atafeh deeply cares for Shireen, but it doesn't feel like love even when they are making it. Atafeh, as the more open and adventurous one, just seems to be enthralled by an illicit tryst, in addition to her attachment to Shireen. <\/span><\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">This type of representation makes lesbianism more of a fetish, a 'I kissed a girl and I like it' experience rather than a real, emotional connection,\u201d said Justine Tisado, an unaffiliated straight ally. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It also doesn't help that Shireen fantasizes about them as sexualized creatures, looking like something out of a porno with high production values, rather than just being sexual women. Shireen's escapist fantasy includes them being objectified as sexual objects of desire, which undermines the fact that their relationship should be liberating and empowering. I'm no prude, but if you're going to show me tit and ass, even balls for that matter, in a film that is not a porno or a raunchy teen comedy, the scene should give me some sort of narrative insight, rather than just exist for pure titillation. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">This is the underlying problem of lesbianism depicted in media, especially those of Asian descent. <\/span><\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I think that women of color have historically been racialized and gendered in very specific ways\u2014often as aggressive, hypersexual, devoid of sexuality. So, it would be of no surprise that these elements are rearticulated within lesbian media,\u201d said Kimberly Chen, current chair for the Queer & Asian Conference who identifies as a queer API. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It's not difficult to google \u201cAsian lesbians in film\u201d and get porn results on the first page. Lesbianism in film and media often serves as erotic novelty and taboo, and Asian lesbianism appears to be a bonafide fetish. APA women are seen in an orientalist lens, appealingly foreign. There's just not enough APA women in the media spotlight to dispel the myth of Asian women as hypersexual beings; they're just people grappling to find their own subjectivity amidst cultural expectations like everyone else.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It's difficult enough to spot APAs in mainstream media, so spotting APA queers is a precarious mission. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Of course, if you really go looking, you'll find a few gems that explore lesbianism in an Asian\/APA context well. And I mean consciously *look* for them because your chances of randomly stumbling upon quality depictions of queers in film and television are very slim, unless you mooch on the Netflix account of a best friend who happens to be a queer cinephile. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The most popular film about APA lesbians is probably 2004's *Saving Face*, which focuses on a Chinese-American surgeon navigating between her love for her dancer girlfriend and her bond with her single mom. <\/span><\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I definitely really enjoy *Saving Face*<\/span>on a personal level,\u201d said Chen, \u201cbecause of the humor it takes on the subject and illustrates well the sort of landscape that not-exactly-out queer API women often face.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">You don't have to be queer or East Asian to appreciate this film because its romantic comedy plot structure is still pretty conventional despite its \u201cspecial topic,\u201d much like how you don't have to be queer or Persian to appreciate the almost art house complexity of *Circumstance*. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yet, how many people have seen these films? I say *Saving Face* is quite popular and *Circumstance* is broadening their distribution (oh wow, almost 30 theaters in the USA), but it ain't *The Notebook *or *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Homosexuality is generally niche subject matter found primarily in independent film territory. Very few people have the opportunity to see these films because they're often not widely distributed. It's hard to sell films with queer protagonists when studios don't like to stray too far from the lowest common denominator and think that the heteronormative public won't go see them.<\/span><\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It's important that we continue to push Asians and APA lesbians to the forefront because their stories may never be told otherwise...Asian and APA queers have a huge uphill battle,\u201d said Tisado.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, despite some reservations, I still highly recommend *Circumstance*. It's a beautiful, thought-provoking film about youth culture in contemporary Iran and the circumstances of women in love, either with each other or with the future possibilities of a liberated identity. <\/span><\/span> \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>eileen tse<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><em><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A review of Circumstance and thoughts on Asian\/APA lesbians in film<\/span><\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Directed by Iranian-American Maryam Keshavarz, <em>Circumstance<\/em> is a 2011 film that focuses on Shireen and Atafeh, two best friends in high school living, loving and partying it up in the Iranian metropolis of Tehran.

I'm no prude, but if you're going to show me tit and ass, even balls for that matter, in a film that is not a porno or a raunchy teen comedy, the scene should give me some sort of narrative insight, rather than just exist for pure titillation. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">This is the underlying problem of lesbianism depicted in media, especially those of Asian descent. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I think that women of color have historically been racialized and gendered in very specific ways\u2014often as aggressive, hypersexual, devoid of sexuality. So, it would be of no surprise that these elements are rearticulated within lesbian media,\u201d said Kimberly Chen, current chair for the Queer &amp; Asian Conference who identifies as a queer API. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It's not difficult to google \u201cAsian lesbians in film\u201d and get porn results on the first page. Lesbianism in film and media often serves as erotic novelty and taboo, and Asian lesbianism appears to be a bonafide fetish. APA women are seen in an orientalist lens, appealingly foreign. There's just not enough APA women in the media spotlight to dispel the myth of Asian women as hypersexual beings; they're just people grappling to find their own subjectivity amidst cultural expectations like everyone else.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It's difficult enough to spot APAs in mainstream media, so spotting APA queers is a precarious mission. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Of course, if you really go looking, you'll find a few gems that explore lesbianism in an Asian\/APA context well. And I mean consciously <em>look<\/em> for them because your chances of randomly stumbling upon quality depictions of queers in film and television are very slim, unless you mooch on the Netflix account of a best friend who happens to be a queer cinephile. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The most popular film about APA lesbians is probably 2004's <em>Saving Face<\/em>, which focuses on a Chinese-American surgeon navigating between her love for her dancer girlfriend and her bond with her single mom. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I definitely really enjoy <em>Saving Face<\/em><\/span>on a personal level,\u201d said Chen, \u201cbecause of the humor it takes on the subject and illustrates well the sort of landscape that not-exactly-out queer API women often face.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">You don't have to be queer or East Asian to appreciate this film because its romantic comedy plot structure is still pretty conventional despite its \u201cspecial topic,\u201d much like how you don't have to be queer or Persian to appreciate the almost art house complexity of <em>Circumstance<\/em>. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yet, how many people have seen these films? I say <em>Saving Face<\/em> is quite popular and <em>Circumstance<\/em> is broadening their distribution (oh wow, almost 30 theaters in the USA), but it ain't <em>The Notebook <\/em>or <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon<\/em>. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Homosexuality is generally niche subject matter found primarily in independent film territory. Very few people have the opportunity to see these films because they're often not widely distributed. It's hard to sell films with queer protagonists when studios don't like to stray too far from the lowest common denominator and think that the heteronormative public won't go see them.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It's important that we continue to push Asians and APA lesbians to the forefront because their stories may never be told otherwise...Asian and APA queers have a huge uphill battle,\u201d said Tisado.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, despite some reservations, I still highly recommend <em>Circumstance<\/em>. It's a beautiful, thought-provoking film about youth culture in contemporary Iran and the circumstances of women in love, either with each other or with the future possibilities of a liberated identity. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 10:20:05 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 10:27:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 10:20:05 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1677,"title":"Ripped by Trojans","slug":"ripped-by-trojans","markdown":"\nby **yifan zhang**<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Recently, Fox Sports ran a piece on their show *The College Experiment* about the University of Utah and the University of Colorado entering the Pac-10, now known as the Pac-12, which is a group of 12 universities that regularly compete athletically with each other.

We realized we were in an opportune capacity to contact these people, which further led us to pursue the making of this documentary.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">What the majority of the featured entertainers have in common is their presence on YouTube. In fact, many would agree that YouTube could be credited as the medium that brought many of these people into the spotlight\u2013and kept them there. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It takes bravery to upload content online because people can write anything they want anonymously, and you just have to believe in yourself and what you're trying to do,\u201d said Diep, the director of <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">*UPLOADED*<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. \u201cThe most successful artists are new media savvy and can navigate the Internet and see how they can get their content out to the most people in the shortest amount of time, and keep people interested for the long run.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In a media world controlled by Hollywood and a few big name corporations, it has been difficult for minorities in America to reach their potential in fame and acclaim. YouTube has given many people not only a means of showcasing their talent, but to do so independently without the regulations or censorship of mainstream media.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I remember when I first discovered Ryan Higa, one of the most popular comedians on YouTube with over four million subscribers. I followed him from the start, witnessing his rise in popularity and his collaborations with other Asian American entertainers who had also gained their fame through YouTube. I loved how all these individuals had found an outlet, one that almost anyone has access to, to exhibit their talent and creativity. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">To this day, many Asian Americans on YouTube are more famous than ever; just a few weeks ago, I attended the International Secret Agents concert that featured Higa, Far East Movement, and many other YouTube figures. The event was sold out and a success.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">As for the next five or 10 years, we wonder what the next generation of Asian Americans and media technologies will bring us. Will YouTube still be just as popular? Will it be just as easy, or even easier, for any common person to grab widespread attention? Will we see more Asians in America\u2019s mainstream pop culture?<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">For now, it is time to look past Hollywood, television, and Top 40, and into the current generation of \u201cmainstream\u201d media. When it comes to the Asian American identity, we need to look beyond who we see in movies and on TV and realize that the presence of the Asian community in America is just as great.<\/span><\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our ultimate goal for *UPLOADED* is to record a very important point in Asian American history. Never before have we had a platform where artists can freely express themselves, with content readily viewable by the world,\u201d said Zhan. \u201cWe want to break stereotypes, that Asians don't just make good lawyers, doctors, or engineers, but they can make equally good comedians, dancers, singers, rappers, filmmakers.\u201d<\/span><\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The Internet is there, it\u2019s leveling the playing field for independent artists like us,\u201d said Paul Dateh, a composer and musician, in the documentary preview. \u201cThe tools are there and it would be a shame for us not to embrace them.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I had the opportunity to ask the producers and director a few questions about their film. Their vision is concrete and inspiring, and their opinions and views are shared by many. It\u2019s about time that someone called attention to the emerging visibility of Asian Americans not only on the Internet, or in the media\u2026but simply in America as a whole. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">**How did you come up with the idea for UPLOADED, and what are your goals for it? What do you envision its reception to be like once it is released?**<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">JZ: The phenomenon of how new media has affected the visibility of Asian Americans in pop culture has been casually discussed on many occasions\u2013amongst friends, heard in panels, read in articles, and seen in brief media segments. However, this information has yet to be compiled into a comprehensive feature-length documentary. When Mark [Gadia] mentioned this, we immediately jumped on the challenge. We want to ignite a passion and excitement in the next generation of Asian Americans to further the movement of bringing equal representation into mainstream media.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">**Who do you hope to reach out to with this documentary?**<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">FM: Anyone and everyone who will listen. We really do believe that something is changing and we want to make sure that everyone from the big executives to everyday Internet users hear what we have to say because it\u2019s not just one person calling the shots, but a collective.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">**What is your favorite part about making this documentary so far?**<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">KD: Hearing the stories of these artists and seeing how all of their stories come together in the big picture. Many of their stories and interactions tie together. We are also very happy about the support from the Asian American community for our film. People want to see this happen and want our voice to be heard so it\u2019s been helpful to have that collective push.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">**Why do you think it\u2019s important to address this topic?**<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">KD: The increased Asian American visibility in entertainment due to new media hasn\u2019t been researched well and it being put into documentary form is a good way to get the message out and a way to document this time in Asian American presence.

In fact, many would agree that YouTube could be credited as the medium that brought many of these people into the spotlight\u2013and kept them there. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It takes bravery to upload content online because people can write anything they want anonymously, and you just have to believe in yourself and what you're trying to do,\u201d said Diep, the director of <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>UPLOADED<\/em><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. \u201cThe most successful artists are new media savvy and can navigate the Internet and see how they can get their content out to the most people in the shortest amount of time, and keep people interested for the long run.\u201d<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In a media world controlled by Hollywood and a few big name corporations, it has been difficult for minorities in America to reach their potential in fame and acclaim. YouTube has given many people not only a means of showcasing their talent, but to do so independently without the regulations or censorship of mainstream media.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I remember when I first discovered Ryan Higa, one of the most popular comedians on YouTube with over four million subscribers. I followed him from the start, witnessing his rise in popularity and his collaborations with other Asian American entertainers who had also gained their fame through YouTube. I loved how all these individuals had found an outlet, one that almost anyone has access to, to exhibit their talent and creativity. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">To this day, many Asian Americans on YouTube are more famous than ever; just a few weeks ago, I attended the International Secret Agents concert that featured Higa, Far East Movement, and many other YouTube figures. The event was sold out and a success.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">As for the next five or 10 years, we wonder what the next generation of Asian Americans and media technologies will bring us. Will YouTube still be just as popular? Will it be just as easy, or even easier, for any common person to grab widespread attention? Will we see more Asians in America\u2019s mainstream pop culture?<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">For now, it is time to look past Hollywood, television, and Top 40, and into the current generation of \u201cmainstream\u201d media. When it comes to the Asian American identity, we need to look beyond who we see in movies and on TV and realize that the presence of the Asian community in America is just as great.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our ultimate goal for <em>UPLOADED<\/em> is to record a very important point in Asian American history. Never before have we had a platform where artists can freely express themselves, with content readily viewable by the world,\u201d said Zhan. \u201cWe want to break stereotypes, that Asians don't just make good lawyers, doctors, or engineers, but they can make equally good comedians, dancers, singers, rappers, filmmakers.\u201d<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The Internet is there, it\u2019s leveling the playing field for independent artists like us,\u201d said Paul Dateh, a composer and musician, in the documentary preview. \u201cThe tools are there and it would be a shame for us not to embrace them.\u201d<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I had the opportunity to ask the producers and director a few questions about their film. Their vision is concrete and inspiring, and their opinions and views are shared by many. It\u2019s about time that someone called attention to the emerging visibility of Asian Americans not only on the Internet, or in the media\u2026but simply in America as a whole. <\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>How did you come up with the idea for UPLOADED, and what are your goals for it? What do you envision its reception to be like once it is released?<\/strong><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">JZ: The phenomenon of how new media has affected the visibility of Asian Americans in pop culture has been casually discussed on many occasions\u2013amongst friends, heard in panels, read in articles, and seen in brief media segments. However, this information has yet to be compiled into a comprehensive feature-length documentary. When Mark [Gadia] mentioned this, we immediately jumped on the challenge. We want to ignite a passion and excitement in the next generation of Asian Americans to further the movement of bringing equal representation into mainstream media.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Who do you hope to reach out to with this documentary?<\/strong><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">FM: Anyone and everyone who will listen. We really do believe that something is changing and we want to make sure that everyone from the big executives to everyday Internet users hear what we have to say because it\u2019s not just one person calling the shots, but a collective.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>What is your favorite part about making this documentary so far?<\/strong><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">KD: Hearing the stories of these artists and seeing how all of their stories come together in the big picture. Many of their stories and interactions tie together. We are also very happy about the support from the Asian American community for our film. People want to see this happen and want our voice to be heard so it\u2019s been helpful to have that collective push.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>Why do you think it\u2019s important to address this topic?<\/strong><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">KD: The increased Asian American visibility in entertainment due to new media hasn\u2019t been researched well and it being put into documentary form is a good way to get the message out and a way to document this time in Asian American presence. It\u2019s an interesting topic because it IS very new, has been making huge waves in Asian American perception in mainstream.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Find out more about <em>UPLOADED: The Asian American Movement <\/em>at <\/span><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/uploadedtaam.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">http:\/\/uploadedtaam.com\/<\/span><\/span><\/a>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 10:34:04 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 10:38:14 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 17 Oct 2011 10:34:04 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1685,"title":"Kollaboration","slug":"kollaboration","markdown":"\nby **steven cong***How a two-hour concert captured the progress of a decade* Kollaboration is the largest Asian Pacific American (APA) talent show in the nation.

To the delight of many students, however, this year's concert took place at UC Berkeley\u2019s own Zellerbach Hall on Sept. 10th. The diversity of ethnicities and talents in this year\u2019s lineup allowed thousands of audience members to experience Kollaboration\u2019s \u201cempowerment through entertainment\u201d first hand. Just over a decade ago, the idea of APAs as hip hop dancers would have seemed unreal for people outside of the APA community. After all, we didn\u2019t have a way of assessing America\u2019s best dance crew back then. If people unfamiliar with APAs were to imagine an APA musician seven years prior to this year\u2019s show, it most likely would have been William Hung. That seriously narrows people\u2019s perceptions of the diversity within the Asian American community, as he is the poster boy for the Model Minority myth and the Asian nerd. With the idea of the studious and submissive nerd so firmly ingrained in many people's minds, it is improbable that they could have envisioned an assertive comedian like Kabeezy Singh, one of the guest performers at this year\u2019s Kollaboration SF. However, seeing so many talented APA musicians, comedians, and dancers on the same stage in the biggest APA talent show in the nation made all those previously inconceivable ideas a clear reality. I remember learning in my Asian American Studies classes about the media\u2019s portrayal of APAs as emasculated yellow perils, obedient model minorities, and second-class citizens throughout the centuries. The distorted image it created became a reality for people in regions without many APAs. And for centuries, we did not have the means to counter that image. I don\u2019t know how much talent has been sacrificed in the APA community as a result of youths being told they were \u201cmeant\u201d to be doctors and not rappers. I also cannot account for the youths who never dared to speak out against racist taunts because the people who looked like them on television simply accepted it. And many times, those people on television did not even look like them because they were white actors playing Asian roles with the help of some eye tape. When Kollaboration was founded in 2000, the APA community still had limited access to independent agency and means of self-representation. That would soon change. In 2001, MC Jin retired undefeated from Black Entertainment Television\u2019s Freestyle Friday competition. In 2006, Yul Kwon was crowned the winner of a season of the television series *Survivor* that divided its competitors based on race. In 2008, the television series *America\u2019s Best Dance Crew* premiered, and each of the past six seasons' winners thus far included at least one person of Asian descent. In between, numerous APA comedians, musicians, and athletes rose to fame on youtube.com. Many of these entertainers began their careers on Kollaboration, which originally focused on Korean American talent before extending its scope to include all APAs. The presence of such diverse talent from a diverse set of backgrounds not only attests to the success of the show, but also to the progress of the APA community as a whole. Clara Chung, one of this year's judges, launched her career through Kollaboration and other concerts centered on APA talent. Every leg of her tour has been sold out, and who knows when this year\u2019s competitors will also become role models that APA youths could reference when they\u2019re told to be doctors instead of artists. \u201cKollaboration hopes to impart with our audience that no dream is out of reach,\u201d said Executive Director Christine Minji Chang in her Director\u2019s Welcome. \u201cWhether your dream is to sing on stage or appear on the big screen\u2026everything begins with courage\u2026and perseverance.\u201d Indeed, courage and perseverance have been the cornerstones of the APA story for much of the past 150 years. Whether it be fighting exclusion acts or combating stereotypes, the APA community has been constantly progressing. After centuries of misrepresentation in mainstream media, we have managed to empower our community through the creation of our own images via mediums such as Youtube and reality TV.

No longer will Sailor Moon be called \"Serena\" or Tuxedo Mask called \"Darien,\" although those names will be forever imprinted into our minds due to the dubbed anime series. They're releasing a more accurate translation of the original Japanese, in addition to including translation notes, color pages, and the supplemental short stories. More importantly because I love a good value, they're condensing 18 volumes into 14. Dang, how can I say no!?! In addition to that, Kodansha USA is publishing the 2 volume \"prequel\" of Sailor Moon, *Codename: Sailor V*, which has never been released in America. The 1st volume of Sailor Moon and Sailor V are out now, with succeeding volumes coming out in two month intervals. Although my days of avid interest and fandom in Sailor Moon are behind me, there is no doubt that I am still invested in this property, like anyone would be invested in things of their childhood.

From the peaceful demonstrations in Los Angeles to the solidarity shown by people in Antarctica, it is truly amazing how much momentum this movement has gained. Although I wasn\u2019t able to take part in the Occupy Oakland event this past October, I felt a surge of pride seeing the tens of thousands of protestors and supporters flooding the highway onramp. Despite the feeling of empowerment that washed over me though, I couldn\u2019t shake off a nagging question: where was the Asian American representation?<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Perhaps Asian Americans have always been a testament to \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d and \u201cpulling yourself up by the bootstraps.\u201d We were the first racial group to be explicitly barred from immigrating into the United States. We\u2019ve been slapped with the \u201cmodel minority\u201d label, the misconception that Asian Americans, despite the obstacles, have done remarkably well in fulfilling the \u201cAmerican Dream:\u201d getting a good education, a good job, and being the token example that other immigrants should follow. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, of the 4,747,000 Asian American households that responded, the median income was $64,308 compared to the median Caucasian household income of $51,846 and African American household income of $32,068. According to these numbers, do Asian Americans deserve to be on the model minority pedestal? Does this put them that much closer to the one percent than any other ethnic group? <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">From a personal standpoint, I\u2019ve never had the luxury of living amongst the so-called one percent. My parents immigrated to the U.S. in hopes of a financially secure future. They took their savings along with some loans and opened their first retail store in a Westfield shopping mall in Southern California\u2014the first of what they hoped would be many. Pretty soon, we had enough money to open two new branches and, at the time, it seemed everything would fall into place. Then 2006 rolled around and my family faced not only a drop in business but a spike in rent. Looking back, maybe the market was just working on supply and demand; regardless, management took advantage of struggling businesses during already tough economic times by raising the lease and forcing tenants to either pay the exorbitant rent or leave altogether. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Yet my parents never really had any leveraging power to begin with; it almost felt like they were picked off due to their lack of autonomy as immigrants. Being an immigrant means being denied many of the advantages that other non-immigrant individuals may have. As an immigrant community and one that is still seen as consisting of perpetual foreigners, Asian Americans will always face challenges on top of the inherent pressures of simply trying to survive. Since only half of all Asian American households in the U.S. responded, the data suffers from response bias and lacks validity in providing an accurate representation of the community. From language barriers to confronting racism, I know my family didn\u2019t live the picture-perfect lifestyle painted by those Census statistics. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">There is something inherent in the system that makes it extremely difficult for Asian Americans to pull themselves by their bootstraps. We can see this illustrated in the gap between Asian Americans in higher education and Asian Americans in executive positions. Sixteen percent of Ivy League students identified themselves as Asian Americans, but only two percent of Fortune 500 executive positions are held by Asian Americans. This only illustrates that, even if Asian Americans are able to get the resources and achieve success in higher education, there are still factors fighting against us. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whether you believe that it\u2019s the Eastern and Western cultural disconnect, best exemplified by the Asian saying \u201cthe loudest duck gets shot\u201d versus Western notions of \u201cthe squeaky wheel gets the grease,\u201d as the reason why Asian Americans don\u2019t usually have keycard access to the C-suite (i.e. the executive titles: chief executive officer, chief operations officer, etc.) or not, Asian Americans need to make themselves visible by having a bigger stake in protests and political matters. When we don\u2019t make ourselves visible, we subconsciously perpetuate the model minority myth. We need to stand up for our community and participate, whether it be in the form of civil disobedience or community mentorship programs in order to fight back against the institutionalized racism that Asian Americans of all socioeconomic backgrounds face. <\/span> \u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Don\u2019t fight the tape\u201d is a saying that means don't bet or trade against the trend in financial markets. Asian Americans, though, are seen as the model minority\u2014the quiet kid who doesn\u2019t upset the system, sets the curve in class, and does well in life without anyone having to worry.

We need to revive our community spirit.<\/span>\n","html":"<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">by <strong>crystal sitt<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">How Occupy Wall Street seems to have taken off without Asian Americans on board and the importance of API active participation in the movement<\/span><\/em>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Occupy Wall Street has seemingly touched all corners of the world. From the peaceful demonstrations in Los Angeles to the solidarity shown by people in Antarctica, it is truly amazing how much momentum this movement has gained. Although I wasn\u2019t able to take part in the Occupy Oakland event this past October, I felt a surge of pride seeing the tens of thousands of protestors and supporters flooding the highway onramp. Despite the feeling of empowerment that washed over me though, I couldn\u2019t shake off a nagging question: where was the Asian American representation?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Perhaps Asian Americans have always been a testament to \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d and \u201cpulling yourself up by the bootstraps.\u201d We were the first racial group to be explicitly barred from immigrating into the United States. We\u2019ve been slapped with the \u201cmodel minority\u201d label, the misconception that Asian Americans, despite the obstacles, have done remarkably well in fulfilling the \u201cAmerican Dream:\u201d getting a good education, a good job, and being the token example that other immigrants should follow. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, of the 4,747,000 Asian American households that responded, the median income was $64,308 compared to the median Caucasian household income of $51,846 and African American household income of $32,068. According to these numbers, do Asian Americans deserve to be on the model minority pedestal? Does this put them that much closer to the one percent than any other ethnic group? <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">From a personal standpoint, I\u2019ve never had the luxury of living amongst the so-called one percent. My parents immigrated to the U.S. in hopes of a financially secure future. They took their savings along with some loans and opened their first retail store in a Westfield shopping mall in Southern California\u2014the first of what they hoped would be many. Pretty soon, we had enough money to open two new branches and, at the time, it seemed everything would fall into place. Then 2006 rolled around and my family faced not only a drop in business but a spike in rent. Looking back, maybe the market was just working on supply and demand; regardless, management took advantage of struggling businesses during already tough economic times by raising the lease and forcing tenants to either pay the exorbitant rent or leave altogether. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Yet my parents never really had any leveraging power to begin with; it almost felt like they were picked off due to their lack of autonomy as immigrants. Being an immigrant means being denied many of the advantages that other non-immigrant individuals may have. As an immigrant community and one that is still seen as consisting of perpetual foreigners, Asian Americans will always face challenges on top of the inherent pressures of simply trying to survive. Since only half of all Asian American households in the U.S. responded, the data suffers from response bias and lacks validity in providing an accurate representation of the community. From language barriers to confronting racism, I know my family didn\u2019t live the picture-perfect lifestyle painted by those Census statistics. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">There is something inherent in the system that makes it extremely difficult for Asian Americans to pull themselves by their bootstraps. We can see this illustrated in the gap between Asian Americans in higher education and Asian Americans in executive positions. Sixteen percent of Ivy League students identified themselves as Asian Americans, but only two percent of Fortune 500 executive positions are held by Asian Americans. This only illustrates that, even if Asian Americans are able to get the resources and achieve success in higher education, there are still factors fighting against us. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whether you believe that it\u2019s the Eastern and Western cultural disconnect, best exemplified by the Asian saying \u201cthe loudest duck gets shot\u201d versus Western notions of \u201cthe squeaky wheel gets the grease,\u201d as the reason why Asian Americans don\u2019t usually have keycard access to the C-suite (i.e. the executive titles: chief executive officer, chief operations officer, etc.) or not, Asian Americans need to make themselves visible by having a bigger stake in protests and political matters. When we don\u2019t make ourselves visible, we subconsciously perpetuate the model minority myth. We need to stand up for our community and participate, whether it be in the form of civil disobedience or community mentorship programs in order to fight back against the institutionalized racism that Asian Americans of all socioeconomic backgrounds face. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201c<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Don\u2019t fight the tape\u201d is a saying that means don't bet or trade against the trend in financial markets. Asian Americans, though, are seen as the model minority\u2014the quiet kid who doesn\u2019t upset the system, sets the curve in class, and does well in life without anyone having to worry. So, we do need to go against the tape and fight against that stereotype. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Moreover, this is a road that needs to be paved as a collective group and not just by a token few.

SR 201 is a bill that states the United States Senate: \u201c(1) acknowledges that the framework of past anti-Chinese legislation, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, is incompatible with the basic founding principles of equality recognized in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution; (2) regrets passing six decades of legislation targeting the Chinese people for physical and political exclusion; and (3) reaffirms its commitment to preserving the same civil rights and constitutional protections for people of Chinese or other Asian descent in the United States accorded to all others.\u201d In other words, SR 201 is supposed to be an official apology to the Chinese American community for decades of racist legislation and treatment, and a resolve to protect the rights and liberties of individuals of Asian descent. It\u2019s been almost 130 years since the passing of the only bill to exclude individuals solely on the basis of race. Passed in 1882 and repealed in 1943, the Chinese Exclusion Act, which blocked Chinese immigrants from the U.S. mainland and denied citizenship to individuals of Chinese descent, was an apt apex of the racist, anti-Chinese sentiment that had been simmering since 1848, when the first wave of Chinese immigrants had eagerly flocked to \u201cGold Mountain\u201d in the quest for lucrative riches. After experiencing the first acts of discrimination against them in the form of physical violence and the Foreign Miners\u2019 Tax, among other things, many Chinese immigrants moved on to other fields of work, causing a perceived competition in the job market and increasing racial tension. Even after the establishment of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, a slew of racist policies followed, ranging from the Geary Act of 1892, which barred those of Chinese descent from bearing witness in court and required all Chinese to carry residential papers, to the Immigration Act of 1917, which designated an Asiatic Barred Zone from which immigration was denied. The effects of this legalized racism were readily apparent: families were torn as a result of being denied entry or reentry, and assimilation grew increasingly difficult for Chinese Americans who were forced to live on the margins of mainstream American society; having no option but to cluster together, Chinatowns abounded, eventually becoming the fodder for vicious stereotypes and contempt still perpetuated in the present day. So 130 years later, where does this leave the Chinese American community\u2014and in a broader sense, the Asian American community? While SR 201 may acknowledge the nation\u2019s injustice to the Chinese American community, that\u2019s really the only thing it does. The fact that the bill sticks a disclaimer that it\u2019s not meant to \u201cauthorize or support any claim against the United States\u201d or to \u201cserve as a settlement of any claim against the United States,\u201d essentially says, \u201cwe\u2019re sorry, but don\u2019t hold us accountable.\u201d But if someone consciously committed a crime, how can you not hold them responsible? If a nation not only admits clear wrongdoing but also remorse, then it\u2019s only rational that it should work to correct those wrongs or at least take measures to prevent anything of the sort from happening again. The only reassurance given in the resolution is the reaffirmation of the nation\u2019s commitment to protect the rights and liberties of individuals of Asian descent\u2014the resolution merely recommits the U.S. to what it was already committed to do in the first place (and ironically broken, on multiple occasions). Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who co-sponsored the resolution, has stated that SR 201 is meant to enlighten those who may not be aware of this regrettable chapter in our history.\u201d But this statement raises some doubts who exactly does the resolution set out to enlighten? If the bill refers to the general mainstream populace not well versed in Asian American history or with Asian Americans in general, it does a pretty terrible job of reaching out to those individuals. Not only is there no direct effort to educate the general public with solid measures like incorporating Asian American history in school curricula, but there\u2019s barely any media coverage on the resolution at all\u2014you have to literally go out of your way to find any information about the resolution or its significance. So while the resolution is meant to acknowledge past wrongs and ultimately provide closure, apologies without amends are essentially empty gestures. Others may argue that it\u2019s the symbolism that counts: a nation acknowledging its wrongdoing is sufficient enough. And to a certain extent, I agree. Acknowledgment, though, is only the first step toward reconciliation; if the nation proffers an apology to the Chinese American and Asian American community, it should take physical responsibility for its past crimes. It\u2019s like slapping a band-aid on a wound and hoping that with time it\u2019ll heal on its own. But we know that sticking on a band-aid isn\u2019t enough. If we want the wound to truly heal, we need to apply medicine that will not only heal the wound, but will make the area surrounding it sturdier and less susceptible to harm. And even band-aids can be detrimental; what is meant to seal things in for safety can in reality lock in already present contaminants and in turn cause the wound to fester and sore to a point where drastic intervention is necessary. And in this case, measures to promote awareness and prevent future injustices from being committed are necessary to truly salve the wounds of the past. Words must be backed by actions, and until measures are taken to address specific injustices, this \u201cofficial\u201d admission of guilt will only be just that: an admission\u2014not an apology.\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>hannah shin<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>The US Senate\u2019s official apology for decades of racist and discriminatory legislation<\/em>\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 6th, Senate Resolution 201 was passed.

Passed in 1882 and repealed in 1943, the Chinese Exclusion Act, which blocked Chinese immigrants from the U.S. mainland and denied citizenship to individuals of Chinese descent, was an apt apex of the racist, anti-Chinese sentiment that had been simmering since 1848, when the first wave of Chinese immigrants had eagerly flocked to \u201cGold Mountain\u201d in the quest for lucrative riches. After experiencing the first acts of discrimination against them in the form of physical violence and the Foreign Miners\u2019 Tax, among other things, many Chinese immigrants moved on to other fields of work, causing a perceived competition in the job market and increasing racial tension.\r\n\r\nEven after the establishment of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, a slew of racist policies followed, ranging from the Geary Act of 1892, which barred those of Chinese descent from bearing witness in court and required all Chinese to carry residential papers, to the Immigration Act of 1917, which designated an Asiatic Barred Zone from which immigration was denied. The effects of this legalized racism were readily apparent: families were torn as a result of being denied entry or reentry, and assimilation grew increasingly difficult for Chinese Americans who were forced to live on the margins of mainstream American society; having no option but to cluster together, Chinatowns abounded, eventually becoming the fodder for vicious stereotypes and contempt still perpetuated in the present day.\r\n\r\nSo 130 years later, where does this leave the Chinese American community\u2014and in a broader sense, the Asian American community?\r\n\r\nWhile SR 201 may acknowledge the nation\u2019s injustice to the Chinese American community, that\u2019s really the only thing it does. The fact that the bill sticks a disclaimer that it\u2019s not meant to \u201cauthorize or support any claim against the United States\u201d or to \u201cserve as a settlement of any claim against the United States,\u201d essentially says, \u201cwe\u2019re sorry, but don\u2019t hold us accountable.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut if someone consciously committed a crime, how can you not hold them responsible? If a nation not only admits clear wrongdoing but also remorse, then it\u2019s only rational that it should work to correct those wrongs or at least take measures to prevent anything of the sort from happening again. The only reassurance given in the resolution is the reaffirmation of the nation\u2019s commitment to protect the rights and liberties of individuals of Asian descent\u2014the resolution merely recommits the U.S. to what it was already committed to do in the first place (and ironically broken, on multiple occasions).\r\n\r\nSenator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who co-sponsored the resolution, has stated that SR 201 is meant to enlighten those who may not be aware of this regrettable chapter in our history.\u201d But this statement raises some doubts who exactly does the resolution set out to enlighten? If the bill refers to the general mainstream populace not well versed in Asian American history or with Asian Americans in general, it does a pretty terrible job of reaching out to those individuals. Not only is there no direct effort to educate the general public with solid measures like incorporating Asian American history in school curricula, but there\u2019s barely any media coverage on the resolution at all\u2014you have to literally go out of your way to find any information about the resolution or its significance.\r\n\r\nSo while the resolution is meant to acknowledge past wrongs and ultimately provide closure, apologies without amends are essentially empty gestures. Others may argue that it\u2019s the symbolism that counts: a nation acknowledging its wrongdoing is sufficient enough. And to a certain extent, I agree. Acknowledgment, though, is only the first step toward reconciliation; if the nation proffers an apology to the Chinese American and Asian American community, it should take physical responsibility for its past crimes. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s like slapping a band-aid on a wound and hoping that with time it\u2019ll heal on its own. But we know that sticking on a band-aid isn\u2019t enough. If we want the wound to truly heal, we need to apply medicine that will not only heal the wound, but will make the area surrounding it sturdier and less susceptible to harm. And even band-aids can be detrimental; what is meant to seal things in for safety can in reality lock in already present contaminants and in turn cause the wound to fester and sore to a point where drastic intervention is necessary. And in this case, measures to promote awareness and prevent future injustices from being committed are necessary to truly salve the wounds of the past. \r\n\r\nWords must be backed by actions, and until measures are taken to address specific injustices, this \u201cofficial\u201d admission of guilt will only be just that: an admission\u2014not an apology.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:17:23 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:19:14 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:17:23 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1779,"title":"API Solidarity: Occupy Cal","slug":"api-solidarity-occupy-cal","markdown":"\nby **steven cong** When Occupy Wall Street first began in the middle of September, nobody could have predicted the extent to which it would grow.

This change would cut an immense amount of resources from these departments and programs like Asian American Studies, as well as deprive students who seek to understand their background of a quality education. Furthermore, Southeast Asian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander students are grossly underrepresented in the UC system, and 40-44 percent of undocumented students in the UC system are API.

As obvious as it seems, as intuitive as it should be, these students have more individual and sincere stories as to how they chose their academic careers. Just ask them. First there is Alex Tang, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering. He originally came to Cal thinking he would major in physics.

She wants to focus on a single path and not have to worry about other decisions. The freedom to not be constrained by single answers is a plus for Huang.

On the other end of the spectrum is Jerry Chen, who loves abstract math and fears the humanities. His interest in a field that causes misery to so many others began at an early age, when Chen\u2019s parents started entering him into math competitions and math camps. Chen found the material to be compelling and built on those interests all the way up to college, where he is now working towards a B.A. in math. \u201cMy parents asked why I wanted to major in abstract math and not applied math, but I overruled them.

Chen plans on going to graduate school so that one day he can become a professor in math and hopefully bring less misery to students than the professors of today do. Last is Jamie Li, a double major in anthropology and Asian studies. Her story is a bit different than the other three students. Although Li originally aspired to be a bioengineer in middle school, events during high school changed her mind. She realized she didn\u2019t like math but the social sciences and humanities instead. After an interview with a doctor, she began thinking about anthropology which matched her interests in the cultural aspect of academia, while also being a popular choice for pre-med students. The plan seemed set and Li decided to be pre-med and anthropology. Then Li\u2019s English teacher asked her a simple question. \u201cWould you be happy being pre-med?\u201d That was a pivotal moment for Li. After thinking about it for a while, she realized she wouldn\u2019t be happy with math, science, or following the footsteps of other anthropology students that were pre-med. It was too clich\u00e9d, so Li decided to go all the way with anthropology. It was in a Chinese class that Li realized she also wanted to explore that particular culture more. However, she wasn\u2019t interested in the literature. Li wanted something more regional, something that explores not only China, but its relation to other countries, its significance in government and politics, and so on. So she decided to major in Asian studies as well. Li recalls one moment where she had to Google translate anthropology for her father. When he read it, he was incredulous, remembering Li\u2019s early goal of being a bioengineer. In the end though, both of Li\u2019s parents strongly supported her choice in anthropology and Asian studies. When asked about APAs and their majors, Li replied, \u201cThere\u2019s always exceptions. A student doesn\u2019t embody a major. A student identifies as much with a major just as majors need students in turn. A student is a part of the academic field like a member of a community, but people fall under several communities, identifying themselves through a unique combination of connections. People can\u2019t be judged based on one stereotype.\u201d The individual stories of these students reflect those sentiments. Each one comes from a different background, which in turn leads to different motivations and ultimately different goals in life. I don\u2019t believe there should be a single answer to how APAs choose their majors. The desire for job security is and always will be a factor, but even then I feel that one's specific motivation is nuanced. Students have their own reasons for picking a major and it would be unsatisfactory to let a stereotype define a group\u2019s motivation for their collegiate pursuits, especially when there are those that diverge from the popular choices of the group. The majors certainly reflect an extension of each student, but the reasons behind them in the first place are not something that can be discovered with sweeping generalizations. To continue pigeonholing these students as hardworking automatons motivated by the tenacity of the mythical creature that is the tiger mom robs Asian American students of their individuality. After all, these four interviewees have shown that there is no single Asian American experience.\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>alex lee<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m sure no one believes that every Asian American student majors in molecular and cellular biology, there are still lingering stereotypes about what motivates these students.

A student doesn\u2019t embody a major. A student identifies as much with a major just as majors need students in turn. A student is a part of the academic field like a member of a community, but people fall under several communities, identifying themselves through a unique combination of connections. People can\u2019t be judged based on one stereotype.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe individual stories of these students reflect those sentiments. Each one comes from a different background, which in turn leads to different motivations and ultimately different goals in life.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t believe there should be a single answer to how APAs choose their majors. The desire for job security is and always will be a factor, but even then I feel that one's specific motivation is nuanced. Students have their own reasons for picking a major and it would be unsatisfactory to let a stereotype define a group\u2019s motivation for their collegiate pursuits, especially when there are those that diverge from the popular choices of the group.\r\n\r\nThe majors certainly reflect an extension of each student, but the reasons behind them in the first place are not something that can be discovered with sweeping generalizations. To continue pigeonholing these students as hardworking automatons motivated by the tenacity of the mythical creature that is the tiger mom robs Asian American students of their individuality. After all, these four interviewees have shown that there is no single Asian American experience.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:34:59 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:36:02 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 21 Nov 2011 22:34:59 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1794,"title":"White Woman Syndrome: Treatment Underway","slug":"white-woman-syndrome-treatment-underway","markdown":"\nby **chi tran***<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Battling the inequalities for people of color in mainstream media<\/span>*<span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Why is it that Asian Pacific Americans (APAs) are rarely featured in movies?

A more recent case, involving the nursing student Michelle Le from Hayward, however, shows the APA community getting one step closer to treating the white woman syndrome.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Le was reported missing in late May 2011. Immediately, the community saw the efforts of her family and friends to raise awareness about Le. Through various methods, Le was kept alive and constant in people\u2019s minds. A website* was created shortly after she went missing, which included updates on the case and blogs from Le\u2019s family and the public. It was a way to engage the community in the process of searching for Le and a means through which they could show their support. Even more significant, this website was a way for news reporters to contact Le\u2019s family to cover the story.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The one and only Facebook was also highly utilized to mobilize the community in the search for Le. Surely, many in the Bay Area received invites to the searches, fundraising events, and vigils. Not surprisingly, many responded with open hearts and supported the family. Facebook was obviously a great way to reach out to the community, particularly to the younger people, who are very active in social media. Their high activity really helps spread the word at an efficient pace.

It seemed to be an excellent method that was completely doable for the public.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">All of these efforts to raise awareness about Le required knowledge that is more commonly found in the second generation, especially in the APA community. Many members of the APA community are first generation immigrants who came to the United States for different reasons but have probably all struggled in one way or another to survive and break through cultural barriers. The world is very fast-paced when it comes to social media and technology, and at times, it is hard for the older generation of immigrants to keep up.

Le\u2019s family is of Vietnamese origin, and 30 years ago, many Vietnamese immigrants were just starting to build their lives here. There were cultural and language barriers that might have hindered their efforts in raising awareness about a situation like Le\u2019s. Fast forward to 2011, as the children of those immigrants are being educated in the U.S. and have adapted to this culture, those barriers seem to be deteriorating.

This signifies the great distance that the APA community has traveled since first generation immigrants first arrived.

The film centers around Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma\u2019s leading political figure for democracy and non-violence, and details the Nobel Peace Prize winner\u2019s humanitarian efforts for peace in a country ruled by an oppressive militaristic regime.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">*The Lady* stirred up some curiosity and intrigue for the goings-on of a country that I wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable about. Any biopic embellishes reality to some extent to feed the imaginations of an audience, so I set out to get the real scoop from someone who saw Burma from a gritty, real-life perspective. I interviewed Nick Gaw, a Cal alum who emigrated from Burma four years ago. His eye-opening experiences gave me insight into why Suu Kyi is such a compelling inspiration for the people of Burma.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Burma is entirely controlled by the junta, the military regime that controls all aspects of government, policy, education, and social reform (or lack thereof). The state\u2019s primary doctrine is submission through fear\u2014fear of freedom of expression, the government, and rule of law. And the first step to subjugating the public is keeping them uninformed. According to Gaw, Burma only spends 1.2 percent of its GDP per year on education. There is a widespread lack of curricula, faculty, and resources in the universities; some students don\u2019t even know where the library is because they aren\u2019t sure if a library even exists. The schools have to submit all materials to the censorship board to get approval.

Gaw remarks that most people go into the military universities for a better education, thinking that they can rise up in the ranks and instigate a coup, but unwittingly end up brainwashed instead.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Suu Kyi and other opposition groups are demonized by the junta as obstructers of peace and development in the country, while the military is lauded as knowing best and bringing peace to the country. Yet, not only do high-ranking military officers receive medical benefits, subsidized food, and gasoline, they also sell these same resources to the public for profit and accept bribes from the families of those accused of treason.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Gaw also believed that due to the kind of education that people receive in the universities, \u201cnobody has faith in the diploma. Med school is the only one that everyone aims for since that's one of the few legitimate institutions.

Only those with the means and resources to study abroad obtain degrees that are acknowledged as legitimate in Burma. Even then, there aren\u2019t a lot of high paying jobs in the country. According to Gaw, another friend graduated with a business degree from Illinois and only gets paid $250 a month from a multi-national company as a management trainee.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Undeterred by the government\u2019s flagrant attempts to crush any freedom of thought, speech, or criticism of the current regime, the people relentlessly continue their fight to attain human rights. Teashops are underground sources of news and communication because openly criticizing the government or talking about democracy might mean never seeing one\u2019s family again. In Burma, there is no such thing as a peaceful protest because there can be no *protesting.* Gathering in groups of more than five people is illegal, but even a peaceful demonstration by one person will guarantee harsh interrogations by military intelligence: that\u2019s like the National Guard forcibly taking you and your friends to prison simply for holding up signs on Upper Sproul.<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Even under such an oppressive regime, people are hopeful that these grim circumstances could change under the leadership of people like Suu Kyi. She promotes peaceful dialogue with the junta, not hostility or violence, because she believes that nothing can be achieved with bloodshed. In 1990, she called for a general election and her party, the National League for Democracy, received 59 percent of the votes and were set to claim 80 percent of the seats in parliament. However, the junta voided the votes and refused to hand over power, and instead made sure that she remained under house arrest for 15 of the last 21 years without charge or trial under martial law. Though she was offered freedom if she left Burma, she refused to take it so she could continue her fight for democracy and human rights.

First of all, endless controversy about her book and article represents white American parents\u2019 huge anxiety about seeing their children fall behind academically. Asian parenting style focused on child education has come into the spotlight within several years. For example, two years ago, President Obama praised Korean Education System. \u201cOur children - listen to this - our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea every year,\u201d he told a gathering at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to prepare them for a 21st-century economy.\u201d 2010 international test scores made people all over the world be interested in the Asian education system. According to Reading, Math and Science scores, it is obvious that Asian students do well in school in general. (Shanghai tops the latest tests. Also, Shanghai, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore ranks within top 5 in all three subjects). The U.S. is traditionally ranked against other OECD countries. On an absolute basis, students from 24 of 34 OECD countries had higher scores than U.S. students, and the Education Department said 17 were better on a statistically significant basis. For example, 15-year-olds in the United States had an average score of 487 in math on a 1,000-point scale. In contrast, Shanghai students scored 600, Singapore, 562; South Korea, Hong Kong, 555; Finland, 541. These series of news, combined to the intensive coverage of news about China\u2019s fast economic growth, attract huge public attention. Although it is hard to conclude that the higher scores are really the result of parenting style, many educational experts started to show interest in aspects of the Asian parenting style which focuses on children\u2019s academic performance. In particular, American parents who have believed in liberal and lenient western parenting style started to have doubts. They feel threatened by the prospect of Asian students getting ahead under the supervision of their super supportive parents. Amy Chua has been criticized a lot after the Wall Street Journal published an excerpt of her book with the title \u2018Why Chinese mothers are superior?\u2019. Critics in the Asian American community say that Amy Chua uses overgeneralizations and unfair stereotypes. They argue that \u201cAmy Chua is giving us a bad name. She is making us look like we are all harsh dragon moms\u201d. However, at a San Francisco book event on January, she made it clear that her book is not a parenting guide book. She says \u201cThis book is a memoir. I never intended to say my style is superior\u201d. The book is meant to show the strengths as well as the weaknesses of her parenting style. She says she believes it also captures an aspect of the Asian immigrant reality, because she talked to many immigrants families and she realized that they have important points in common when it comes to parenting styles. Most of my friends in Berkeley say \u201cAmy Chua is wrong, my mom is anything but a tiger mom, but I ended up in Berkeley\u201d. However, in my opinion, Amy Chua has good reasons to raise her children in strict way. She says \u201cI was raised by extremely strict but also extremely loving Chinese immigrants. Looking back on my childhood, my parents\u2019 high expectation was the greatest gift to me\u201d A mistake she says she made was to be overconfident in her parenting style. The strict parenting style which came from her parents didn\u2019t work for her own children. She struggled when her second daughter started hating her and their relationship became disastrous. At this moment of her crisis she decided to write a book and finished it just in 2 months. Readers were shocked when they came to the passage which describes Amy Chua prohibiting her children getting grades lower than an A, TV, playdates and sleepovers, and warning her pianist child that \"if the next time's not perfect, I'm going to take all your stuffed animals and burn them\u201d. Some accused Amy Chua of being heartless and a lunatic, but some started to think \u201cmaybe she is right\u201d. They love her or love to hate her. In truth, tiger mothers have existed for a long time. Why is it so controversial right now? Here is my answer: these past few years, Asian students\u2019 academic achievements drew global attention toward Asian students and the Asian educational system.

Here is my advice for parents who are worrying\r\nabout their children getting behind because they never have been pushing their\r\nchildren as much as Amy did: When it comes to the parenting style, there is no right\r\nanswer, the most important thing is understanding your children first before deciding\r\nwhich parenting style to stick to.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 12:20:19 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 12:20:19 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 12:20:19 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1912,"title":"photos","slug":"photos","markdown":"\n[**<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">fall 2011<\/span>**](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/fall-2011\/?show=gallery) [**<span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">fall 2013<\/span>**](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/photos\/fall-2013\/)\n","html":"<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/fall-2011\/?show=gallery\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">fall 2011<\/span><\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/photos\/fall-2013\/\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">fall 2013<\/span><\/strong><\/a>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 14:29:52 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 02 Nov 2013 05:20:31 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 14:29:52 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1922,"title":"fall 2011","slug":"fall-2011","markdown":"\n[nggallery id=1]\n\n\n","html":"[nggallery id=1]","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":37,"created_at":"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 14:38:38 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 07 Jan 2012 16:36:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 14:38:38 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1934,"title":"our history","slug":"our-history","markdown":"\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/56NBBfQaF9o\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe> A video synopsis of our history.\n","html":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/56NBBfQaF9o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nA video synopsis of our history.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":16,"created_at":"Sat, 07 Jan 2012 16:37:48 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 01 Oct 2012 23:48:07 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 07 Jan 2012 16:37:48 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1955,"title":"Disturbing details emerge of A...","slug":"disturbing-details-emerge-of-a","markdown":"\nDisturbing details emerge of Asian-American soldier's final hours: forced by comrades to crawl 100 m [http:\/\/t.co\/G1nMgWWD](http:\/\/t.co\/G1nMgWWD)\n\n\n","html":"Disturbing details emerge of Asian-American soldier's final hours: forced by comrades to crawl 100 m <a href=\"http:\/\/t.co\/G1nMgWWD\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/t.co\/G1nMgWWD<\/a>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 18:55:21 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 20:41:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":1981,"title":"The hardboiled Decal!","slug":"the-hardboiled-decal","markdown":"\nNeed units?

I could not decide whether I liked him or merely felt interested in him, if these could even be separate ideas. Then a thought at the back of my mind, one that had been growing for months, made all my other ones collapse. My senses caved in and I began to cry silently, not out of shame but utter relief that I no longer had to question my bisexuality. All that took place a few months ago, and since then I have told a close circle of friends who respect my choice. Yet I still doubt myself. What experience am I drawing from if I have never dated anyone, if at times I feel utterly straight and other times completely doubtful? I worry that I will be sexually involved with men only and romantically involved with women only, but never a stable relationship with one person. I worry whether I should just identify as straight, because I grew up that way and everyone in my family lives that way. I worry about what people will think when they hear. After I confided to one of my friends, she responded, \"You know I'm straight, right?\" Joining a handful of Asian American organizations has given me more opportunities to express myself and better understand the queer community, but I still feel frustrated. I know I speak with privilege, as someone who can pass as heterosexual in most cases without effort, but I lack confidence in the queer space, where I feel inhibited from joining conversations on sex. The pressures to appeal to the opposite gender and the same gender play tug-of-war inside me, but more and more I tire of the mind games. From being an Asian American Studies major, I have learned to think from both the view of the oppressed and the oppressor. From being a woman, I have learned firsthand the psychological damage that comes from an unhealthy relationship with someone much older. Throughout my privileged life, I have had to learn the hard way, and as painful as the hard way is, I would rather live with the burden of truth than ignorance. For me, truth means acknowledging that I do not know everything about myself or the people closest to me, that my identity does not belong to me only but can also be shared openly with others, sometimes violated by them. Knowing the truth only means understanding vulnerability, seeing only how my perception of reality has invisible but direct consequences on myself and others around me. One's sexual orientation makes up just one part of a complex identity that includes class, culture, education, ethnicity, family ties, gender, nationality, political views, religious affiliation, and social status.

I could not decide whether I liked him or merely felt interested in him, if these could even be separate ideas. Then a thought at the back of my mind, one that had been growing for months, made all my other ones collapse. My senses caved in and I began to cry silently, not out of shame but utter relief that I no longer had to question my bisexuality.\r\n\r\nAll that took place a few months ago, and since then I have told a close circle of friends who respect my choice. Yet I still doubt myself. What experience am I drawing from if I have never dated anyone, if at times I feel utterly straight and other times completely doubtful? I worry that I will be sexually involved with men only and romantically involved with women only, but never a stable relationship with one person. I worry whether I should just identify as straight, because I grew up that way and everyone in my family lives that way. I worry about what people will think when they hear. After I confided to one of my friends, she responded, \"You know I'm straight, right?\" Joining a handful of Asian American organizations has given me more opportunities to express myself and better understand the queer community, but I still feel frustrated. I know I speak with privilege, as someone who can pass as heterosexual in most cases without effort, but I lack confidence in the queer space, where I feel inhibited from joining conversations on sex. The pressures to appeal to the opposite gender and the same gender play tug-of-war inside me, but more and more I tire of the mind games.\r\n\r\nFrom being an Asian American Studies major, I have learned to think from both the view of the oppressed and the oppressor. From being a woman, I have learned firsthand the psychological damage that comes from an unhealthy relationship with someone much older. Throughout my privileged life, I have had to learn the hard way, and as painful as the hard way is, I would rather live with the burden of truth than ignorance. For me, truth means acknowledging that I do not know everything about myself or the people closest to me, that my identity does not belong to me only but can also be shared openly with others, sometimes violated by them. Knowing the truth only means understanding vulnerability, seeing only how my perception of reality has invisible but direct consequences on myself and others around me. One's sexual orientation makes up just one part of a complex identity that includes class, culture, education, ethnicity, family ties, gender, nationality, political views, religious affiliation, and social status. In a sense, truth only shows me how little I know of the world, that it functions not as a static entity but an ever-expanding perspective that grows along with the individual.\r\n\r\nTruth has taught me to question feelings, because the person who says \"I love you\" but fails to show it could hurt me more than the people who hurt me only because they care about me.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\" caption=\"sorry, it&#39;s just emotion that&#39;s taking me over\"]<img src=\"http:\/\/25.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_m0dnlcRWGg1rqmmq4o1_500.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"255\" \/>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI have always relied on the strength of my emotions to guide me through social interactions with family, close friends, and acquaintances, but of course all too often I mislead myself into tense situations.

Proponents of affirmative action argue that it promotes academic readiness among those who are admitted, regardless of race, and that the admission standard for state educational institutions is placed on merit, independent of race, rather than in addition to race. Opponents assert that this leaves behind certain minority groups who have not had the resources to attend SAT courses and tack on countless extracurricular activities to their transcripts. A crucial question remains: In their mission to increase diversity and take race into account, do non-race blind schools also end up discriminating against certain groups\u00a0because\u00a0they can admit students partially on the basis of race?\n\nThe Ivy Leagues are not race blind in their admissions processes and this focuses attention on how they choose to admit the students that apply. Over the past five years, the percentage of Asian students has remained static at about 20 percent, dubbed the \u201cAsian ceiling.\u201d On the other hand, institutions like UC Berkeley are race blind in their admissions processes and Asians comprise about 40 percent of their student body. Caltech is also race blind in their admissions process and Asians comprise one-third of their student body. What accounts for this disparity between these schools and the Ivy institutions? Is it possible that it is due to the fact that California does not take race into account when considering an applicant and the Ivy Leagues do? This could very well be the case.\n\nPrinceton sociologist Thomas Espenshade affirms that racial discrimination against Asian applicants occur in the nation\u2019s most elite universities. In 1997, he conducted a survey that found an Asian American student needs a 1550 SAT score to have an equal chance of gaining admittance when compared to a Caucasian student who only needs a 1410, or an African American student, who only needs an 1100. Due to this supposed \u201cAsian ceiling,\u201d some half-Asian, half-Caucasian students now check the \u201cWhite\u201d box when applying for such schools.

Proponents of affirmative action argue that it promotes academic readiness among those who are admitted, regardless of race, and that the admission standard for state educational institutions is placed on merit, independent of race, rather than in addition to race. Opponents assert that this leaves behind certain minority groups who have not had the resources to attend SAT courses and tack on countless extracurricular activities to their transcripts. A crucial question remains: In their mission to increase diversity and take race into account, do non-race blind schools also end up discriminating against certain groups\u00a0because\u00a0they can admit students partially on the basis of race?<\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">The Ivy Leagues are not race blind in their admissions processes and this focuses attention on how they choose to admit the students that apply. Over the past five years, the percentage of Asian students has remained static at about 20 percent, dubbed the \u201cAsian ceiling.\u201d On the other hand, institutions like UC Berkeley are race blind in their admissions processes and Asians comprise about 40 percent of their student body. Caltech is also race blind in their admissions process and Asians comprise one-third of their student body. What accounts for this disparity between these schools and the Ivy institutions? Is it possible that it is due to the fact that California does not take race into account when considering an applicant and the Ivy Leagues do? This could very well be the case.<\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade affirms that racial discrimination against Asian applicants occur in the nation\u2019s most elite universities. In 1997, he conducted a survey that found an Asian American student needs a 1550 SAT score to have an equal chance of gaining admittance when compared to a Caucasian student who only needs a 1410, or an African American student, who only needs an 1100. Due to this supposed \u201cAsian ceiling,\u201d some half-Asian, half-Caucasian students now check the \u201cWhite\u201d box when applying for such schools. For those who are full Asian, it\u2019s difficult to implement this strategy. For some half-Asians, however, they consider it a necessary maneuver to ensure they have a fair chance of getting into Yale, Harvard, or Columbia, as any other person of another racial group would.<\/p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">If such discrimination really exists, is indicating the \u201cWhite\u201d box rather than checking the \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cAsian\u201d box acceptable?

However, this club doesn\u2019t deal with things like networking to get ahead in the job market or solicit your attendance for some quirky activity. Instead, the Berkeley chapter of Liberty in North Korea begins with the documentary\u00a0*Kimjongilia*\u00a0to show how millions of people are suffering from fear and starvation under a totalitarian regime and then asks you: what are we going to do about this blatant violation of human rights? Unfortunately, many still don\u2019t realize the dire situation going on in North Korea. Who can blame them when most of the media about the country involves the late Kim Jong Il or the possibility of nuclear weapons? For all they know, North Korea is just a communist country with a caricature of a leader that threatens the world\u2019s stability. Still, since the early 2000s, more media is being released involving the concentrations camps and the severity of treatment prisoners\u2019 face. This leads to LiNK\u2019s overall purpose: educate people that there\u2019s a problem to begin with. This is not an advocation for communism, nor is it seeking sympathy for the leadership of the country. Instead, the members of LiNK wish to raise awareness that North Korea puts its own people in work camps, fails to feed them even the most meager of meals, and imposes endless propaganda of how successful the country is, which is a complete lie. What is it that necessarily motivates these students to deal with such depressing issues that most would just sympathize for a moment before ignoring it and getting back to their routine lives? LiNK president, Emily Chi, describes, \u201cThe people of North Korea are voiceless. They have no channels to speak freely and those that do escape fear speaking out against the regime because of the danger it puts any family members in that are still in the country.\u201d Essentially, our free speech needs to speak out for the people who are otherwise unable to. Now some may think that if the country is really that terrible, why don\u2019t they just leave? The thing is the only way to leave the country is to escape by crossing the northern border between Korea and China. The only sure way of accomplishing this without getting shot is to bribe their way across the border, which usually means selling all of their possessions and homes, if they haven\u2019t already sold it for food. And here\u2019s the kicker: even though these people have risked everything to leave the country, crossing the North Korean border is no guarantee of their safety. If the escapees are caught by the Chinese authorities, they are sent back to North Korea where they and their families are made an example of by being subjected to a firing squad. In other cases, refugees are abducted by human traffickers and sold as servants or sex slaves, facing brutality just as bad as the concentration camps they fled. The situation is depressing, terrible, immoral, and choosing to ignore the issue and do nothing will only continue the problem. But how does one even begin trying to make a difference in what appears to be an impossible mission? As it turns out, LiNK is holding a fundraiser this upcoming March to help fund the underground railroad that transports refugees to Mongolia or Southeast Asia, where they won\u2019t be repatriated. From March 12th-16th, students can sign up to take part in a weeklong challenge taking place the following week where they will try living off the official rations of a North Korean citizen\u2014about a cup of rice a day, for five days. The rice is provided by the club and they encourage participants to donate whatever money they would have spent on food that week to the cause. Last year, LiNK raised approximately $2,500 which is enough to save one refugee. This year LiNK hopes to save two. LiNK faces many challenges as they try to make a difference in the lives of North Koreans. Whether it be just getting students to know what the club is actually about or coping with the emotional toil one is put through when dealing with millions of deaths, LiNK stands strong in their goal to make one more refugee\u2019s life better. The club members' support for each other is their strength, and they will continue to fight until the lives of North Koreans are improved. Q & A with members of LiNK **hb**: What made you want to be a part of LiNK? Carrie: I was exposed to the atrocities in high school through a documentary. It left an emotional mark on me and so I\u2019ve been a part of LiNK since last semester. **hb**: What are the meetings like? Youngeun: The format is always changing, but we do a lot of informational lectures to educate people more about the issue. We also have film screenings and forums so we can discuss the issues with the student body. **hb**: What keeps you going through all this? C: Where\u2019s the fairness in all this? People in the same era as me are living in starvation. How is that fair? It makes me grateful that I was so fortunate to live somewhere else, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for people in this day and age to live in fear while others live in comfort. **hb**: If you could tell the student body anything, what would it be? Y: 2012 is the 100th anniversary of the late Kim Il Sung, and I feel that this is a symbolic time for action. This is a critical time to think of how to be more aware of international issues and get the US more involved.

Although Danny Chen died on October 3, 2011, I didn\u2019t spot any news articles circulating his case on Facebook until December. It was one of those posts my friends shared with half-hearted remarks, such as \u201cPoor guy,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d and \u201cHow could anyone do this?\u201d It\u2019s easy to distance ourselves from a person\u2019s harsh situation and think, \u201cI\u2019m blessed to be living a life like mine and not his.\u201d But this hate crime is based on something much larger than the individual. The military hazing of men like Chen is founded upon racial inequalities and prejudices that communities of color struggle against every day. What\u2019s frightening about this reality is that we American citizens put our faith in the hands of the men who \u201cserve our nation,\u201d the so-called \u201cArmy Strong.\u201d Yet judging by how vague and unresponsive the U.S. military is in uprooting these blatant hate crimes, how can APA communities\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">*not*<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0wonder how many others are undergoing the exact same brutal practices? These military hazings were first brought up in two high-profile 2011 cases: Harry Lew and Danny Chen. Although both were in different branches of the military, they faced similar circumstances of aggressive treatment by their peers. <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">*New York Magazine*<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0revealed that \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #1a1a1a;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">eight men charged in connection with [Chen\u2019s] death are all white and range in age from 24 to 35,\u201d and that these men were guilty of racial slurs, neglect of duty, and abuse of authority, even going so far as to put Chen in a hard hat and force him to give commands in Chinese.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> It also mentioned that because Lew fell asleep on guard duty, \u201chis fellow lance corporals\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #1a1a1a;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">ordered him to do push-ups, then stomped on his back and legs if he didn\u2019t do them right; poured sand in his mouth; punched him in the back of his helmet; and forced him to dig a chest-deep foxhole.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u201d When questioned whether Lew faced any racial discrimination within the military, however, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #212121;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">several Marines said Lew was the target of some jokes and teasing, like many other Marines of all ethnic backgrounds, but they weren't aware he was discriminated against because of his race,\u201d according to\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #212121;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">*Associated Press*<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #212121;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whether or not Lew\u2019s sufferings explicitly stemmed from racism as in Chen\u2019s case, ignorance alone can\u2019t propel \u201cjokes and teasing\u201d to the harsh aggression that led Lew to kill himself. To present Lew\u2019s suffering as an accident is an insult to the glaring issue at hand\u2014that those in the military subconsciously accept hazing and bullying without understanding that these are manifestations of social inequalities. While these military reports suggest a strong correlation between the hazings and the suicides, the court rulings determining the perpetrators\u2019 fates don\u2019t reflect the gravity of these violent events. In fact, the Army recommended dropping the charges of involuntary manslaughter against Specialist Ryan Offutt, one of the suspects involved with Chen\u2019s death. An MSNBC update this February on the latest court-martial decision stated that \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #262626;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Orozco was acquitted of charges involving the assault, cruel treatment and humiliation of Lew.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #262626;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Defense attorney Captain Aaron Meyer maintains these actions as well-meant, justifying that \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #262626;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Orozco was authorized to have a Marine in the squad do physical training like push-ups if the purpose was to maintain good order and discipline, there was no malice involved, and the training didn't physically exhaust the Marine.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0Of course,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">*every*<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0soldier needs to have a battered body and a mouth full of sand to know good discipline. Although military superiors like Meyer acknowledge the presence of these actions, they make light of the situation when these victims\u2019 families are in grief, their demands for compensation unheard. The fact that racism against ethnic minorities is never explicitly stated as the main cause of these hazings is but a testament to the lack of social justice within the military system. How ironic that our nation fights for freedom and justice when we can\u2019t enforce that within our own ranks of power. Since Sept. 11<\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">th<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">, America\u2019s race awareness has spiked with a hypersensitivity to the threat abroad in the Middle East.

During a recession when everyone needs money to keep afloat, mainstream news stations can\u2019t highlight any discriminatory issues within our military without fear of being labeled as traitors to the \u201cgreater good of society.\u201d What\u2019s even more shocking is the lack of awareness and reception by the APA community, let alone by the general public.

It was one of those posts my friends shared with half-hearted remarks, such as \u201cPoor guy,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d and \u201cHow could anyone do this?\u201d It\u2019s easy to distance ourselves from a person\u2019s harsh situation and think, \u201cI\u2019m blessed to be living a life like mine and not his.\u201d But this hate crime is based on something much larger than the individual. The military hazing of men like Chen is founded upon racial inequalities and prejudices that communities of color struggle against every day.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s frightening about this reality is that we American citizens put our faith in the hands of the men who \u201cserve our nation,\u201d the so-called \u201cArmy Strong.\u201d Yet judging by how vague and unresponsive the U.S. military is in uprooting these blatant hate crimes, how can APA communities\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>not<\/em><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0wonder how many others are undergoing the exact same brutal practices?\r\n\r\nThese military hazings were first brought up in two high-profile 2011 cases: Harry Lew and Danny Chen. Although both were in different branches of the military, they faced similar circumstances of aggressive treatment by their peers.\r\n\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>New York Magazine<\/em><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0revealed that \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #1a1a1a;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">eight men charged in connection with [Chen\u2019s] death are all white and range in age from 24 to 35,\u201d and that these men were guilty of racial slurs, neglect of duty, and abuse of authority, even going so far as to put Chen in a hard hat and force him to give commands in Chinese.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\r\n\r\nIt also mentioned that because Lew fell asleep on guard duty, \u201chis fellow lance corporals\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #1a1a1a;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">ordered him to do push-ups, then stomped on his back and legs if he didn\u2019t do them right; poured sand in his mouth; punched him in the back of his helmet; and forced him to dig a chest-deep foxhole.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen questioned whether Lew faced any racial discrimination within the military, however, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #212121;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">several Marines said Lew was the target of some jokes and teasing, like many other Marines of all ethnic backgrounds, but they weren't aware he was discriminated against because of his race,\u201d according to\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #212121;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>Associated Press<\/em><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #212121;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">.\r\n\r\n<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Whether or not Lew\u2019s sufferings explicitly stemmed from racism as in Chen\u2019s case, ignorance alone can\u2019t propel \u201cjokes and teasing\u201d to the harsh aggression that led Lew to kill himself. To present Lew\u2019s suffering as an accident is an insult to the glaring issue at hand\u2014that those in the military subconsciously accept hazing and bullying without understanding that these are manifestations of social inequalities.\r\n\r\nWhile these military reports suggest a strong correlation between the hazings and the suicides, the court rulings determining the perpetrators\u2019 fates don\u2019t reflect the gravity of these violent events. In fact, the Army recommended dropping the charges of involuntary manslaughter against Specialist Ryan Offutt, one of the suspects involved with Chen\u2019s death.\r\n\r\nAn MSNBC update this February on the latest court-martial decision stated that \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #262626;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Orozco was acquitted of charges involving the assault, cruel treatment and humiliation of Lew.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #262626;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\r\n\r\n<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Defense attorney Captain Aaron Meyer maintains these actions as well-meant, justifying that \u201c<\/span><span style=\"color: #262626;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Orozco was authorized to have a Marine in the squad do physical training like push-ups if the purpose was to maintain good order and discipline, there was no malice involved, and the training didn't physically exhaust the Marine.\u201d<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0Of course,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><em>every<\/em><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u00a0soldier needs to have a battered body and a mouth full of sand to know good discipline.\r\n\r\nAlthough military superiors like Meyer acknowledge the presence of these actions, they make light of the situation when these victims\u2019 families are in grief, their demands for compensation unheard. The fact that racism against ethnic minorities is never explicitly stated as the main cause of these hazings is but a testament to the lack of social justice within the military system. How ironic that our nation fights for freedom and justice when we can\u2019t enforce that within our own ranks of power.\r\n\r\nSince Sept. 11<\/span><sup><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">th<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">, America\u2019s race awareness has spiked with a hypersensitivity to the threat abroad in the Middle East.

During a recession when everyone needs money to keep afloat, mainstream news stations can\u2019t highlight any discriminatory issues within our military without fear of being labeled as traitors to the \u201cgreater good of society.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even more shocking is the lack of awareness and reception by the APA community, let alone by the general public.

I could also talk about how a handful of Chinese Americans fought alongside both Union and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. And how could I forget about one of the most decorated units in the American Armed Forces: the 442nd Infantry Regiment, the famed Japanese-American Nisei unit who fought the Nazis in Europe? Among the soldiers in the unit who were awarded the 21 total Medals of Honor is Senator Daniel Inouye, who lost his right arm during his service. Despite these numerous accomplishments, Asian Americans continue to be discriminated against, yet the increasing number of future Asian American officers and enlisted men will hopefully make the military more inclusive. The history of Asian Americans is far from rosy. Even though the 442nd Infantry Regiment is now considered one of the most highly decorated regimental units, discrimination against Asians during World War II prevented official recognition of the Nisei soldiers, leading to many of the decorations, including the 21 Medals of Honor being awarded 50 years later. The plight of Asian Americans in the military did not get better as the United States entered the Cold War. In the following decades, Asian American GI\u2019s often found themselves as the only Asian Americans in their combat units, surrounded by hostilities from not only the enemy, but within their units. During the Vietnam War, Asian American soldiers were often mistaken for the enemy, spit with racial slurs, beatings and death threats. When Vietnam veteran David Oshiro was injured in combat, his helicopter Medevac was delayed because U.S. soldiers were afraid he was Vietnamese. The military institution that belittles the accomplishments of Asian Americans still exists. Nineteen-year-old Private Danny Chen killed himself because he was singled out as the sole Asian American in the unit. His enemy was not the Afghan insurgents but the enlisted men in his own unit. Racial slurs were mixed with the physical abuse he was forced to endure. More Asian Americans in officer roles will hopefully improve the perception of Asians in the military. With more Asian officers, other servicemen will be less willing to make racial attacks on Asians Americans either because they respect their commanders or they do not want to be disciplined. Asian Americans have already made an impact on the military establishment. A total of 103 Asian American officers have attained the position of general or admiral. Most prominent is General Eric Shinseki, who served as Chief of Staff for the Army under both the Clinton and Bush administrations. After graduating from West Point in 1965, he served as an artillery forward observer, and during his service in the Vietnam War, he lost a portion of his foot in combat after stepping on a land mine. Yet, General Shinseki may only be the tip of the iceberg for Asian American officers, for a new generation of Asian American officers is following the footsteps set by Shinseki and other senior officers. Approximately 10 percent of United States service academy students are Asian American, which is double the proportion of Asian Americans in the U.S. population. The new influx of Asian junior officers will increase the general percentage of Asian officers, which is currently at 4 percent. Some of these younger officers might rise in the ranks and eventually become the role models and leaders of a future American military. In addition to elite service academies such as Annapolis and West Point, Asian Americans are also joining ROTC programs at universities like Stanford, Harvard and [of course] UC Berkeley. Take Jukay Hsu for example. After graduating from Stuyvesant, he went to Harvard and was part of the ROTC program. Instead of pursuing a PhD in economics, he joined the Army, eventually rising to the rank of captain and has since returned safely to New York after a tour of duty in Iraq. Hsu\u2019s educational background has not hindered his military aspirations. As more Asian Americans make up university student bodies, more Asians will also be attracted to selective service academies and ROTC programs. Why? The combination of patriotic duty and free tuition are very convincing for the 50,000 cadets that choose to join. The most obvious solution to make the military more inclusive to Asian Americans is to have more Asian Americans in the military, especially as officers. As I have witnessed in high school, Marine recruiters are currently targeting Asian Americans who simply want to enlist as privates. Yet, Asian Americans who want to go to college directly or have already graduated should also give military service a second look. More Asian Americans need to recognize that military service and educational attainment are not mutually exclusive, that one could receive a degree from Harvard while having a leadership position in the Army afterwards. Want to become a lawyer? You could become a JAG (Judge Advocate General) lawyer who represents both defense and prosecution in military courts. Looking towards a medical career? Military surgeons are always in short supply. Do you have sights on dental school? The Navy always needs dentists. Military service and leadership needs not only guns and bullets but also the skills of trained professionals. With more Asian Americans in the military as platoon commanders, lawyers, doctors, dentists, nurses, and chaplains, perhaps the perception of Asian American in the military might change. As more Asian Americans join service academies and ROTC programs, more Asian Americans will become junior officers and, eventually, senior officers. If Danny Chen\u2019s commanding officer was Asian American, perhaps he would not have been as indifferent to Chen\u2019s racist and brutal treatment. Perhaps Chen could have had an Asian American role model in the military, giving him a glimmer of hope as to who he could become.

That is, in the wake of tragedy, the Japanese government\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d more closely resembles an espionage clusterfuck, suggesting a divestment in the health of those most continually affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. By now, most of the world is familiar with the March 11th catastrophe: the Tohoku Earthquake claimed about 22,000 lives after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami devastated northeastern Japan, particularly Fukushima Prefecture, where the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is located. The resultant nuclear meltdown, which released consequential amounts of radioactive material into the environment, has been continuously identified as the worst nuclear calamity since Chernobyl. Clearly this is not an easy situation to repair. Thousands have been displaced while the government struggles to clean up a literally deadly disaster site. However, its understandably sparse restoration efforts appear more like negligence when considering the lack of transparency authorities have exhibited throughout the recovery phase. For one, the government has failed to follow through on expert recommendations that would address radiation in Fukushima\u2019s unique environment. For instance, Fukushima is comprised of 71 percent woodlands, which exacerbates radiation levels when radioactive soil washes into residential areas due to rainfall. Contaminated rainfall also aggregates in street gutters and is absorbed by the leaves of certain shrubs. Moreover, there exists the perpetual danger of consuming food and water with dangerous amounts of radioactivity. But according to a report by Health24, officials have not evacuated children and pregnant women, in spite of repeated expert counsel to do so. In fact, officials have also stated that it is unnecessary to evacuate certain regions that fall below the 20-millisievert annual limit of radiation, despite contrary findings by local residents, who are conducting their own radioactivity tests due to government distrust. Therein lies the more shocking problem: local residents and farmers are now conducting radiation tests and publishing their results because of a growing belief that the government disingenuously downplays the severity of the situation in Fukushima. According to the\u00a0*New York Times*, along with the discovery of tainted beef in July, one incident in particular heavily prompted local producers to disregard official information and take matters into their own hands; farmers in Onami, a small farming town near the power plant, debunked the government\u2019s flawed conclusion that much of the food cultivated in the region was safe to consume. The authorities\u2019 methodology lucidly displays their inaccuracy: the authorities\u2019 assessment of food grown in Onami only tested two of its 154 rice farms. Officials have also acknowledged the fallibility of randomly sampled tests, considering that perilous levels of radiation are much more concentrated in some areas of Fukushima than in others. Of course, many are also questioning why farming is even being allowed in the highly unsafe region in the first place; prefecture officials have reported that about 20 percent of the farms in Fukushima are contaminated with Cesium, though allegedly only 30 surpass the Japanese government\u2019s safety levels. A comprehensive, unified report on the levels of radiation in the area is yet to materialize, though one is presently in the works. According to\u00a0*Business Week*, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation is currently working to publish an international and independent analysis of the Fukushima disaster and its repercussions. Given the substantial discrepancies in the global and domestic reports of radioactive material (*Business Week*\u00a0estimates that studies by the government-operated Tokyo Electric Power Co. reported up to 77 percent less radioactive emissions than have overseas assessments), this study is evidently necessary. In fact, inconsistencies in the government\u2019s official numbers have aroused public suspicion ever since the immediate aftermath of the quake. But\u00a0*Business Week*\u00a0also reports that the report will not be ready until May 2013, indicating that it will be more than a year until Fukushima residents can definitively know how hazardous their prefecture is. But in the midst of all this confusion, one question remains: one year later, where is the real information about Fukushima? Those more sympathetic to the government argue that overseas agencies sensationalize their reports on Japan\u2019s radiation levels. Anti-nuclear activists utilize the situation to further their agendas, while media outlets, particularly those who have covered the story in-depth, hyper-exaggerate the circumstances in order to draw in viewers. This issue is problematic, but those who claim that reports have been sensationalized miss the point. The figures put out by the government have been discrepant, the methodology has been faulty, and there are clear political reasons why the government would want to leave the situation be. Skepticism is healthy, but there are otherwise no reasons not to believe more urgent international reports. Many in Fukushima believe the government\u2019s inaction aims to maintain order and avoid compensating many of the agricultural businesses negatively impacted by the disaster. According to the\u00a0*Times*, agricultural officials have even openly recognized that offering more details would frighten away consumers, and that if farming ceased in an area due to radiation, it would take years before the public allowed it to start there again.

That is, in the wake of tragedy, the Japanese government\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d more closely resembles an espionage clusterfuck, suggesting a divestment in the health of those most continually affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\r\n\r\nBy now, most of the world is familiar with the March 11th catastrophe: the Tohoku Earthquake claimed about 22,000 lives after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami devastated northeastern Japan, particularly Fukushima Prefecture, where the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is located. The resultant nuclear meltdown, which released consequential amounts of radioactive material into the environment, has been continuously identified as the worst nuclear calamity since Chernobyl.\r\n\r\nClearly this is not an easy situation to repair. Thousands have been displaced while the government struggles to clean up a literally deadly disaster site. However, its understandably sparse restoration efforts appear more like negligence when considering the lack of transparency authorities have exhibited throughout the recovery phase.\r\n\r\nFor one, the government has failed to follow through on expert recommendations that would address radiation in Fukushima\u2019s unique environment. For instance, Fukushima is comprised of 71 percent woodlands, which exacerbates radiation levels when radioactive soil washes into residential areas due to rainfall. Contaminated rainfall also aggregates in street gutters and is absorbed by the leaves of certain shrubs. Moreover, there exists the perpetual danger of consuming food and water with dangerous amounts of radioactivity. But according to a report by Health24, officials have not evacuated children and pregnant women, in spite of repeated expert counsel to do so.\r\n\r\nIn fact, officials have also stated that it is unnecessary to evacuate certain regions that fall below the 20-millisievert annual limit of radiation, despite contrary findings by local residents, who are conducting their own radioactivity tests due to government distrust.\r\n\r\nTherein lies the more shocking problem: local residents and farmers are now conducting radiation tests and publishing their results because of a growing belief that the government disingenuously downplays the severity of the situation in Fukushima.\r\n\r\nAccording to the\u00a0<em>New York Times<\/em>, along with the discovery of tainted beef in July, one incident in particular heavily prompted local producers to disregard official information and take matters into their own hands; farmers in Onami, a small farming town near the power plant, debunked the government\u2019s flawed conclusion that much of the food cultivated in the region was safe to consume.\r\n\r\nThe authorities\u2019 methodology lucidly displays their inaccuracy: the authorities\u2019 assessment of food grown in Onami only tested two of its 154 rice farms. Officials have also acknowledged the fallibility of randomly sampled tests, considering that perilous levels of radiation are much more concentrated in some areas of Fukushima than in others. Of course, many are also questioning why farming is even being allowed in the highly unsafe region in the first place; prefecture officials have reported that about 20 percent of the farms in Fukushima are contaminated with Cesium, though allegedly only 30 surpass the Japanese government\u2019s safety levels.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive, unified report on the levels of radiation in the area is yet to materialize, though one is presently in the works. According to\u00a0<em>Business Week<\/em>, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation is currently working to publish an international and independent analysis of the Fukushima disaster and its repercussions. Given the substantial discrepancies in the global and domestic reports of radioactive material (<em>Business Week<\/em>\u00a0estimates that studies by the government-operated Tokyo Electric Power Co. reported up to 77 percent less radioactive emissions than have overseas assessments), this study is evidently necessary. In fact, inconsistencies in the government\u2019s official numbers have aroused public suspicion ever since the immediate aftermath of the quake. But\u00a0<em>Business Week<\/em>\u00a0also reports that the report will not be ready until May 2013, indicating that it will be more than a year until Fukushima residents can definitively know how hazardous their prefecture is.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of all this confusion, one question remains: one year later, where is the real information about Fukushima?\r\n\r\nThose more sympathetic to the government argue that overseas agencies sensationalize their reports on Japan\u2019s radiation levels. Anti-nuclear activists utilize the situation to further their agendas, while media outlets, particularly those who have covered the story in-depth, hyper-exaggerate the circumstances in order to draw in viewers.\r\n\r\nThis issue is problematic, but those who claim that reports have been sensationalized miss the point. The figures put out by the government have been discrepant, the methodology has been faulty, and there are clear political reasons why the government would want to leave the situation be. Skepticism is healthy, but there are otherwise no reasons not to believe more urgent international reports.\r\n\r\nMany in Fukushima believe the government\u2019s inaction aims to maintain order and avoid compensating many of the agricultural businesses negatively impacted by the disaster. According to the\u00a0<em>Times<\/em>, agricultural officials have even openly recognized that offering more details would frighten away consumers, and that if farming ceased in an area due to radiation, it would take years before the public allowed it to start there again.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Fukushima is a public health issue, but it is also a political, human rights issue about government unaccountability. What Fukushima needs now from the API community (and Americans in general) is not only philanthropy, but international pressure. As Americans, we saw similar mismanagement during Hurricane Katrina and during 9\/11. As APIs, we are witnessing the little people being screwed over by their government. Those similitudes should motivate us to act.\r\n\r\nEven though the facts are still nebulous, there is no way for Japan to navigate unless its authorities cut the bullshit and clear the fog.

From the late 19th century, Chinese immigrants in Western countries have been objectified as the \u201cYellow Peril,\u201d a term that both immediately racializes and accuses all of these yellow-skinned foreigners of endangering the Western way of life. Throughout the 20th century, Asians continued to be associated with malicious cunning in mass media, perhaps best exemplified by the \u201cFu Manchu\u201d archetype of the criminal mastermind in pop culture: intelligent, heartless, and bent on destroying Western civilization.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">****<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Hoekstra\u2019s ad doesn\u2019t just fear monger by playing on outdated stereotypes with a modern female Fu Manchu; it also undermines the individual cultures of different countries by presenting an Orientalized landscape containing various indistinct elements of Asian cultures. Though implicit, it is obvious that the woman in the ad is supposed to be Chinese. However, the looming vermilion clouds and shadowy palm trees behind fields of rice evoke a different image in the average American\u2019s subconscious\u2014the Vietnam War and all of its horrors. This mixed, mysterious, exotic Oriental setting portrays the woman as representative of an Asian mass menace and only intensifies the divide between Asians\u2014even Asian Americans, often viewed as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d\u2014and the West.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">****<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Of course, the great irony is that the actress portraying this machinating Oriental \u201cyellowgirl\u201d (the name of her image in the html code of Hoekstra\u2019s now-removed website for the ad) is none other than Lisa Chan, a Chinese American and recent UC Berkeley graduate with a degree in Sociology. Chan, a 21-year-old who lists youth empowerment, education, and pageantry among her passions on her website, released a brief statement of apology on her Facebook page that was later rescinded; coincidentally, Hoekstra\u2019s ad was finally taken down around the same time\u2014weeks after its release.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">****<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">In the formerly released statement, Chan said she was \u201cdeeply sorry for any pain that the character I portrayed brought to my communities\u201d and that \u201cthis role is not in any way representative of who I am.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span> \u00a0 <span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Though she identifies herself as part of \u201cher\u201d communities, she simultaneously distances herself from the character she knowingly and willingly portrayed as a hired actress. Chan apologizes for the character, but not for her portrayal, citing her own involvement in communities, work to empower others, and recent graduation as excuses for her ignorance. She also fails to mention the critical point in this controversy<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u2014the fact that her portrayal was racist and offensive. Her apology would have been the place for her to start working toward undoing some of the damage by addressing the issue at hand, but she asks for forgiveness instead. These are the questions I would like Chan to answer: If you are so involved in community empowerment, why did you decide to go through with this at all? Will we ever hear a real apology from you?<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">****<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">At first glance, Chan appears to be true to her self-portrayal\u2014a role model for youth actively involved in community issues. However, with the rescission of her non-apology, as well as a brand new website featuring airbrushed glamour shots of herself and inspirational quotes, it is clear that the issue of her involvement in this racist advertisement has been whited out; whether this was done so in deference to her contract or for personal reasons is unclear. While her former non-apology was vague and evasive, she at least attempted to demonstrate regret for her role in the controversy, stating that she was \u201cdetermined to resolve [her] actions.\u201d Now, with the complete whiting out of the incident, it is dubious this will ever happen.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">****<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Chan was the one person in the position to step forward, explain herself, and use the attention to raise awareness of racism and Asian Pacific American issues. Instead, she appears to have funneled her time and resources into self-promotion. When I look at Chan, I see a bright young woman, recently graduated from this institution and involved in various community projects\u2014ostensibly a face that could represent some of us in the APA community\u2014who has, by attempting to hide any evidence of her involvement in Hoekstra\u2019s ad campaign, made the second-worst decision of her career.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">****<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Hoekstra\u2019s advertisement, as well as the subsequent removal of all material with no explanation or apology, is a jarring wake-up call to all of us.

How is it acceptable for said actress and campaign to then remove all content, only after being repeatedly criticized in the media, without a sincere apology acknowledging personal fault to the APA community? If nothing else, it is apparent that we, as a community and as a society, still have much work to do.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\n\n\n","html":"by <strong>laurie song<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>The silence surrounding the revocation of a UC Berkeley graduate\u2019s role in a racist political ad campaign<\/em>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">During the 2012 Super Bowl, former Republican U.S. Representative Pete Hoekstra ran an extremely disturbing advertisement in Michigan, his home state, as part of his campaign for U.S. Senate, starring a racist caricature of an Asian woman representing the sinister \u201cChinese\u201d beneficiaries of his opponent\u2019s spending plan.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>\r\n\r\n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The 30-second ad opens with the ringing of a gong and ominous Oriental music as the camera pans across a rice paddy with palm trees in the background.

However, the looming vermilion clouds and shadowy palm trees behind fields of rice evoke a different image in the average American\u2019s subconscious\u2014the Vietnam War and all of its horrors. This mixed, mysterious, exotic Oriental setting portrays the woman as representative of an Asian mass menace and only intensifies the divide between Asians\u2014even Asian Americans, often viewed as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d\u2014and the West.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>\r\n\r\n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Of course, the great irony is that the actress portraying this machinating Oriental \u201cyellowgirl\u201d (the name of her image in the html code of Hoekstra\u2019s now-removed website for the ad) is none other than Lisa Chan, a Chinese American and recent UC Berkeley graduate with a degree in Sociology. Chan, a 21-year-old who lists youth empowerment, education, and pageantry among her passions on her website, released a brief statement of apology on her Facebook page that was later rescinded; coincidentally, Hoekstra\u2019s ad was finally taken down around the same time\u2014weeks after its release.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>\r\n\r\n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">In the formerly released statement, Chan said she was \u201cdeeply sorry for any pain that the character I portrayed brought to my communities\u201d and that \u201cthis role is not in any way representative of who I am.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Though she identifies herself as part of \u201cher\u201d communities, she simultaneously distances herself from the character she knowingly and willingly portrayed as a hired actress. Chan apologizes for the character, but not for her portrayal, citing her own involvement in communities, work to empower others, and recent graduation as excuses for her ignorance. She also fails to mention the critical point in this controversy<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">\u2014the fact that her portrayal was racist and offensive. Her apology would have been the place for her to start working toward undoing some of the damage by addressing the issue at hand, but she asks for forgiveness instead. These are the questions I would like Chan to answer: If you are so involved in community empowerment, why did you decide to go through with this at all? Will we ever hear a real apology from you?<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>\r\n\r\n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">At first glance, Chan appears to be true to her self-portrayal\u2014a role model for youth actively involved in community issues. However, with the rescission of her non-apology, as well as a brand new website featuring airbrushed glamour shots of herself and inspirational quotes, it is clear that the issue of her involvement in this racist advertisement has been whited out; whether this was done so in deference to her contract or for personal reasons is unclear. While her former non-apology was vague and evasive, she at least attempted to demonstrate regret for her role in the controversy, stating that she was \u201cdetermined to resolve [her] actions.\u201d Now, with the complete whiting out of the incident, it is dubious this will ever happen.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>\r\n\r\n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Chan was the one person in the position to step forward, explain herself, and use the attention to raise awareness of racism and Asian Pacific American issues. Instead, she appears to have funneled her time and resources into self-promotion. When I look at Chan, I see a bright young woman, recently graduated from this institution and involved in various community projects\u2014ostensibly a face that could represent some of us in the APA community\u2014who has, by attempting to hide any evidence of her involvement in Hoekstra\u2019s ad campaign, made the second-worst decision of her career.<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>\r\n\r\n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Hoekstra\u2019s advertisement, as well as the subsequent removal of all material with no explanation or apology, is a jarring wake-up call to all of us. How is it that, in today\u2019s society, a Chinese American graduate of UC Berkeley\u2014in Sociology, no less\u2014is hired by a white man\u2019s political campaign to portray a disgusting, fear mongering racial caricature of a Chinese person that is subsequently broadcast statewide before being called out for racism? How is it acceptable for said actress and campaign to then remove all content, only after being repeatedly criticized in the media, without a sincere apology acknowledging personal fault to the APA community? If nothing else, it is apparent that we, as a community and as a society, still have much work to do.<\/span><\/span><\/span>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":27,"created_at":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 23:26:55 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 23:26:55 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 23:26:55 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2159,"title":"From the Bench to Linsanity","slug":"from-the-bench-to-linsanity","markdown":"\nby **steven cong***the phenomenon that is Jeremy Lin* When Taiwanese American basketball player Jeremy Lin was dropped from the Golden State Warriors on December 9, 2011, it seemed as if our worst fears were confirmed.

That week was marked by a streak of wins that launched Lin from his reputation as a benchwarmer on the Golden State Warriors to a phenomenon whose impact far transcended the average basketball player. Linsanity had begun. It was incredible. Those figures lit a fuse that exploded within the realms of social media and the internet. Lin became a household name on Twitter and Facebook, and Asian American blogs like Channel APA and Angry Asian Man provided frequent updates on Lin\u2019s successes.

We\u2019re seen as weak perpetual foreigners who are consistently and systematically emasculated through American media and pop culture. So when Lin came to dominate a traditional American sport synonymous with masculinity, it got people\u2019s attention. Linsanity would have happened either way, but the phenomenon it became was only possible due to this age of social media.

Seeing and hearing Boggs and Davis speak was very inspirational, especially since Grace Lee Boggs is a 96 years old Chinese-American woman who is still fighting for social justice. \u00a0Because I relate more closely with Grace Lee Boggs (and she also spoke a great deal more than Davis), I will mostly talk about her. Grace Lee shared her experiences growing up as a Chinese woman and how the roles that came with that identification held her back. Boggs is the daughter of Chinese immigrants and lived a stable and comfortable life growing up; yet she knew the world needed change. Boggs was an activist in Detroit, Michigan, working with many African American communities. Boggs was and still is such a revolutionary social justice activist, she has her own thick FBI file! Now Boggs is still active, but she is fighting for change in a different way: by speaking and sharing her knowledge with the younger generations. Grace Lee Boggs shares many of her revolutionary points including the idea of using your imagination, visionary organizing, philosophy, and change. Boggs mentions, \"Imagine a new world...\" prompting the crowd to imagine and see the change they want. Boggs relates this idea back to our current events: the Occupy Movement. The Occupy Movement is a good starter, but as activists, we all have to voice our change, what we want to change, and how we see the change. Boggs and Davis both agree that as people, we cannot sit back and expect change to happen without changing ourselves. We have to use our imagination and be visionary organizers. We have to envision our goals, where we want to be, the \"perfect\" change we need. We have to be able to see what we want before we can expect to actually make the change.\u00a0Grace Lee Boggs shares that a victory only creates new challenges. As we continue to win, we have to keep fighting to ensure that we keep winning. Bring this idea back to all your communities: be visionary organizers, promote non-violence, work with anyone and everyone and keep imagining. A revolution is on it's way, and we are the leaders that are going to make the change!\n\n\n","html":"\"Imagine a new world...\"\r\n\r\nOn March 2, 2012, social justice activists Grace Lee Boggs and Angela Davis visited the UC Berkeley campus to speak of their experiences as female activists and to talk about revolution.\r\n\r\nTicketless and arriving exactly at 4PM, I noticed that the line had extended from the MLK building all the way to the fountain in the middle of Sproul and swerved right back to the front of MLK.

For more than a century, the Daily Californian has provided students with a reliable and professional source for campus news. But remember, the Daily Cal touts itself as an *independent organization*; it hasn't been given funding from the ASUC for the last four decades.

Oikos University, April 2nd will be remembered as the day a lone gunman by the name of One Goh shot and killed seven people, while injuring three more. What should have been a normal day for students at Oikos University soon became the biggest school shooting seen since the Virginia Tech incident in 2007.\n\nSo why Oikos University? It\u2019s a small South Korean Christian college that prepares students for careers in nursing, while also teaching courses in music, Asian medicine and English as a second language, though the school has recently had issues with accreditation.\n\nAs it turns out, Goh was a nursing student at Oikos University before he was kicked out several months ago for general misbehavior and anger management issues. His return to the school was a search for the administrative official who expelled him, but when Goh could not find her, he proceeded to shoot students in the classroom nearest to him, having them line up and killed if they refused. By the time the police arrived, five were already dead and two more would die later in a hospital. Six of his seven victims were female.\n\nCurrently, the crime is seen as motivated by Goh\u2019s inability to get along with the women on campus. In a school where both students and faculty are predominantly female, Goh did not feel like he fit in, and he felt mistreated and disrespected when the other female students ridiculed his poor English skills. Even officials noted how he simply could not deal with women in general. Alone and isolated, Goh felt no community connection with the other students, and when he was forced to leave at the behest of a female official, Goh decided he had enough.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Goh has also had a troubled past even before coming to California. In his previous state of Virginia, Goh collected over $23,000 in debt before being evicted from his apartment. In the course of a year, he also lost a brother in an auto wreck and his mother who moved back to Seoul after leaving Oakland.

A History of Violence: Luc was originally born in Vietnam, but he later immigrated to the United States where he settled into a life of crime. He was sentenced in 1998 to 11 years and four months in San Quentin for the armed robbery of a Chinese restaurant in San Jose.

Because Asian gangs know many Asian American immigrant families will not report to the police, they target Asian families. The Model Minority: Yet, even though the Asian American community has problems with criminality, the model minority myth prevents both Asians and non-Asians from acknowledging it. Luc\u2019s neighbors described the convicted felon as a \u201cfine person, not a criminal.\u201d A court reporter described him as \u201cboyish-looking.\u201d For some reason, people can\u2019t grasp the fact that this man is capable of slaughtering a whole family. We have preconceived stereotypes of what a murderer looks like, and in this instance, the stereotype has blinded us from the reality. What about the issues surrounding the victims? They might have been entangled with criminal elements in the Asian American community seeing that they had problems with gambling debts. But Jess Lei, a software engineer at Qualitative Medical Systems, was described by her employer as a \u201csmart, quiet person,\u201d so he knew something was wrong when she did not call in for her absence. No one would have suspected her family to be deep in debt with loan sharks and Asian gangsters. If others had found out about the family's involvement with Asian gangs, they would have acted preemptively to prevent them from being the targets of a madman. These stereotypes prevent policy makers and law enforcement from providing resources to stamp out criminality in the Asian American community. Families need to be informed and protected from gangs. Most importantly, open dialogue between law enforcement and the community must be maintained to prevent gangs from preying on families like the Leis.

SASC seeks to empower, motivate, and create a community for students while addressing the economic inequalities, social injustices, and political underrepresentation that Southeast Asians face. Even though it is highly known that a large population on the UC Berkeley campus is \u201cAsian\/Pacific Islander,\u201d when you statistically break up that percentage, Southeast Asians actually constitute a very low number of students. In 2011, ASUC Senator Larry Bach found that only about 3 percent of students admitted that fall were identified as Southeast Asians: 133 Vietnamese, 11 Thai, 10 Hmong, 8 Cambodian, and 5 Laotian students out of over 5,000 admits. Southeast Asians are underrepresented on this campus, but SASC is here to help! SASC has multiple programs geared different ways to uplift and enlighten the Southeast Asian community on and off-campus. SASC Anthology documents the undocumented memories and stories of Southeast Asians and the Vietnam War experience through creative writing. Anthology annually publishes chapbooks for others to read, learn, and continue to share and pass on these stories. <\/div><div>The External Relations program of SASC fosters Southeast Asian communities outside of Berkeley and across California in an effort to empower one another while creating a community of Southeast Asian organizations and groups. Similarly, Internal Relations works on building a community with other organizations within the Berkeley campus and community. Southeast Asian Mentorship (SEAM) is a group mentorship for high school students in Richmond, Oakland, and Berkeley. The mentor-mentee relationship is not only for academic support, but also empowerment in pursuing higher education and learning about Southeast Asian history, as well as creating friendships and bonds.<\/div><div> To further reach outside of campus, SASC has a program called SEAPOP\u2014Southeast Asian Prison Outreach Project. SEAPOP is a pen-pal outreach system between college students in SEAPOP and Southeast Asian prisoners. SEAPOP works on deconstructing the social stigma placed upon the incarcerated by listening to the stories of the incarcerated. Last but not least, every summer, SASC presents the Summer Institute (SI). SI provides an opportunity for Southeast Asian high school students to experience the college life along with learning about their SEA history and sharing their own stories and experiences. SI is a 5-day, 4-night, all-expenses-paid program for high school students. Throughout the days and nights, students participate in workshops that incorporate education (SEA culture, food, higher education, and history) into a memorable bonding experience. Mentees from all over California and across the country are placed with mentors from different college campuses to create a more intimate support system.<\/div><div> Susan Vang, a first year undergraduate at UC Berkeley, shares her story as a Hmong student impacted by the works of SASC. Vang\u00a0was a SASC SI mentee in 2010 and, because of her experience at SI, she applied to UC Berkeley and chose to attend.<\/div><div> \u201cBefore my first exposure to SASC SI, I felt shameful of being Hmong,\u201d Vang shared, \u201cSASC SI has taught me a piece of my history that no textbook can do\u2026 I\u2019ve learned to love myself; to embrace my identity as a Hmong American woman and to cherish my family. I\u2019ve learned to be aware of the struggles that Southeast Asians have faced, politically, socially, academically, and mentally; all of which make me feel that much more thankful for having gotten this far in my life.\u201d Now Vang is an active member of SASC. She is a mentor with SEAM, a student writer in SEAPOP and a committee member for SASC\u2019s Benefit Concert. For a small community, SASC makes a big difference in the lives of youth, college students and the environment at UC Berkeley and the community. SASC continues to build leaders, positively influencing students to pursue higher education and to educate and support one another. Through the roots of struggle, SASC finds love and creates a sense of family.

SEAPOP works on deconstructing the social stigma placed upon the incarcerated by listening to the stories of the incarcerated.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, every summer, SASC presents the Summer Institute (SI). SI provides an opportunity for Southeast Asian high school students to experience the college life along with learning about their SEA history and sharing their own stories and experiences. SI is a 5-day, 4-night, all-expenses-paid program for high school students. Throughout the days and nights, students participate in workshops that incorporate education (SEA culture, food, higher education, and history) into a memorable bonding experience. Mentees from all over California and across the country are placed with mentors from different college campuses to create a more intimate support system.<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nSusan Vang, a first year undergraduate at UC Berkeley, shares her story as a Hmong student impacted by the works of SASC. Vang\u00a0was a SASC SI mentee in 2010 and, because of her experience at SI, she applied to UC Berkeley and chose to attend.<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n\u201cBefore my first exposure to SASC SI, I felt shameful of being Hmong,\u201d Vang shared, \u201cSASC SI has taught me a piece of my history that no textbook can do\u2026 I\u2019ve learned to love myself; to embrace my identity as a Hmong American woman and to cherish my family. I\u2019ve learned to be aware of the struggles that Southeast Asians have faced, politically, socially, academically, and mentally; all of which make me feel that much more thankful for having gotten this far in my life.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow Vang is an active member of SASC. She is a mentor with SEAM, a student writer in SEAPOP and a committee member for SASC\u2019s Benefit Concert.\r\n\r\nFor a small community, SASC makes a big difference in the lives of youth, college students and the environment at UC Berkeley and the community. SASC continues to build leaders, positively influencing students to pursue higher education and to educate and support one another. Through the roots of struggle, SASC finds love and creates a sense of family.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get more involved:\r\nE-mail:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:UCB.SASC@gmail.com\">UCB.SASC@gmail.com<\/a>\r\nWebsite:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ocf.berkeley.edu\/~sasc\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.ocf.berkeley.edu\/~sasc\/<\/a>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>Upcoming events:\r\nParty with SASC!

The films we watched addressed themes like LGBT issues, death, and social justice in a number of innovative ways. However, none of these themes are commonly associated with APIs, as mainstream media portrays APIs through one dimensional stereotypes. It was unusual at first to watch these American themes placed within API settings amongst API characters, and this fact alone meant these films challenged conventional notions of what is \u201cnormal\u201d and who gets to \u201cbelong\u201d in America and its national discourse.

Too often in American history, APIs have just been viewed as that Long Duck Dong or William Hung, and made to embody only fragments of what constitutes well-rounded and complex characters. The reality of Asian America is that we are unique individuals in a community that encompasses the entire spectrum of human personality and character. The movies at this year\u2019s festival represented that diversity in moments like Patrick Wang\u2019s fight for his son during\u00a0*In the Family*\u00a0and Booboo Stewart\u2019s compassion for his brother in\u00a0*White Frog*. They represented the transnational character of Asian America by addressing the crusade of Ngawang Choephel to preserve his native music and ways in which APIs on both sides of the Pacific interact with Christmas. They preserve the pieces of API ancestral homelands that we carry within ourselves, and they set a firm foundation for APIs to grow in America. To put it simply, they humanize us against the monolithic stereotypes we see in Hollywood. Many of the films were very ambitious, and the stories of the filmmakers themselves were inspiring.\u00a0*Bang Bang\u00a0*offered a very realistic depiction of Asian American gangs, and one of my fellow delegates told me that \u201cit hit closer to home than\u00a0*Better Luck Tomorrow*,\u201d which is a seminal piece of Asian American cinema by director Justin Lin. Byron Qiao, the director of\u00a0*Bang Bang*, claimed that he wanted to paint an \u201cauthentic picture\u201d of an Asian American gangster. Mye Hoang, the director of\u00a0*Viette*, depicted her own story in her thought-provoking and ambitious first film. Through the telling of her own personal experiences, she was able to communicate issues of generation gap, domestic abuse, and mental health issues. The aggregate experience of watching those films, meeting the people who made them, and observing the ways in which they supported each other blurred the line between the fiction we create and the stories we build in real life. And the way that both supplements and develops each other is what really excites me. Through our journey within different theaters watching different films and our talks with legendary directors like Quentin Lee, I am excited at the potential of API cinema and where it could still go. The range of this year\u2019s films was diverse. However, a good friend once told me that art imitates life, and I would expect no less from an API cinematic movement that seeks to emulate the diversity of its community. As the community continues to grow, I have no doubt that the quality, diversity, and creativity of our cinema will grow as well. As long as Hollywood continues to cast API men as emasculated males and API women as submissive China Dolls, we\u2019ll need the artists within our community to represent who we are on the big screen and in pop culture. If anything, moments like the packed theater's prolonged applause after the screening of\u00a0*White Frog*\u00a0only affirm this persistent need.\n\n\n","html":"By <strong>steven cong<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs a student delegate for the Center for Asian American Media\u2019s San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival that took place March 8th-18th, I had the incredible privilege to watch films like<em>\u00a0White Frog<\/em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>In the Family<\/em>\u00a0in historic theaters and meet the people who created them.

To put it simply, they humanize us against the monolithic stereotypes we see in Hollywood.\r\n\r\nMany of the films were very ambitious, and the stories of the filmmakers themselves were inspiring.\u00a0<em>Bang Bang\u00a0<\/em>offered a very realistic depiction of Asian American gangs, and one of my fellow delegates told me that \u201cit hit closer to home than\u00a0<em>Better Luck Tomorrow<\/em>,\u201d which is a seminal piece of Asian American cinema by director Justin Lin. Byron Qiao, the director of\u00a0<em>Bang Bang<\/em>, claimed that he wanted to paint an \u201cauthentic picture\u201d of an Asian American gangster.\r\n\r\nMye Hoang, the director of\u00a0<em>Viette<\/em>, depicted her own story in her thought-provoking and ambitious first film. Through the telling of her own personal experiences, she was able to communicate issues of generation gap, domestic abuse, and mental health issues.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate experience of watching those films, meeting the people who made them, and observing the ways in which they supported each other blurred the line between the fiction we create and the stories we build in real life. And the way that both supplements and develops each other is what really excites me.\r\n\r\nThrough our journey within different theaters watching different films and our talks with legendary directors like Quentin Lee, I am excited at the potential of API cinema and where it could still go. The range of this year\u2019s films was diverse. However, a good friend once told me that art imitates life, and I would expect no less from an API cinematic movement that seeks to emulate the diversity of its community. As the community continues to grow, I have no doubt that the quality, diversity, and creativity of our cinema will grow as well.\r\n\r\nAs long as Hollywood continues to cast API men as emasculated males and API women as submissive China Dolls, we\u2019ll need the artists within our community to represent who we are on the big screen and in pop culture. If anything, moments like the packed theater's prolonged applause after the screening of\u00a0<em>White Frog<\/em>\u00a0only affirm this persistent need.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":27,"created_at":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 01:25:23 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 01:25:23 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 01:25:23 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2350,"title":"The New Dog in Town","slug":"the-new-dog-in-town","markdown":"\n*The rising popularity of Asian fusion cuisine within the food truck phenomenon\u00a0***by **laurie song** Upper Sproul is a UC Berkeley landmark usually packed with various student groups and students trying to avoid their flyers. Though the students are a permanent fixture, the food trucks dotting the entrance to our campus seem to be ever-changing. This year, one of the notable additions is Dojo Dog, a small Asian fusion food truck with big ambitions. Food trucks serving specialty foods are a relatively recent phenomenon in the United States. Though food trucks and street vendors existed well before the 21st century, entrepreneurial food trucks with an emphasis on creative, gourmet foods have experienced a resurgence in popularity since 2008, with the economic downturn and the advent of social media. For aspiring restaurateurs, food trucks are a relatively inexpensive way to sell food and bring it to the people. The medium also allows chefs to take greater creative risks. Menus are often not only fun and inventive but fluid, taking into account customers\u2019 feedback and suggestions. Once established, food trucks rely on word-of-mouth and social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and Yelp to maintain the truck\u2019s fan base while expanding the brand to new customers. Perhaps the most well-known food truck on the West Coast is Kogi BBQ in Los Angeles, which serves Korean Mexican fare such as spicy pork tacos and kimchi quesadillas. Kogi, which took off in 2008, now has almost 98,000 followers on Twitter keeping up with its ever-changing locations and menu, and has become something of a traveling landmark. Their success has been so great that they have now expanded to five trucks and one sit-down bar. In the wake of its success, many Asian American entrepreneurs have followed in Kogi\u2019s tire tracks and started their own Asian fusion food trucks. Asian fusion cuisine has roots in Asian colonial history when Western imperialism initiated the diffusion of different food culture elements across Western and Asian boundaries. Some foods we consider to be familiar today\u2014chicken tikka masala, pearl milk tea, halo halo\u2014incorporate both sides of that colonial history. Later, with the increase of globalization and transnationalism around the 19th century, Asian immigrants came to the United States, bringing their cuisines and food traditions with them. Though some settled in ethnic enclaves such as Chinatowns, assimilation and acculturation were inevitable, resulting in distinctively Asian American foods such as Chinese chicken salad, spam musubi, egg rolls, California rolls, and fortune cookies. Today, Asian foods and their Americanized fusion counterparts are relatively established in the American mainstream food culture. A century ago, raw fish on vinegared rice would probably have been met with disgust and a lot of questions. Trying a new food, while potentially eye-opening, can also be seen as an accessible and safe way to demonstrate one\u2019s cultural curiosity and open-mindedness. Today\u2019s new generation of Asian Americans is creating a different and deliberate form of Asian fusion cuisine, and the mobile food truck is quickly becoming their investment of choice. Though they all share the same passion for delicious food, regardless of origin, each proprietor has a different story to tell. Michael Koh, a 3rd year Environmental Economics undergraduate student at UC Berkeley who emigrated from Taiwan at the age of 16, is the owner of Dojo Dog, which opened for business in January 2012. Dojo Dog \u201ccombine[s] the classic American hot dog with the unique flavors of Asia,\u201d with hot dog toppings ranging from seaweed and Japanese mayonnaise to teriyaki sauce and pork sung. The story behind Dojo Dog starts out as perhaps many a Berkeley student\u2019s Friday night does: after a night of inebriated revelry, Koh and his friends decided to go to Top Dog. However, upon their return, they realized they had forgotten to add any condiments to their hot dogs. With no ketchup or mustard at home, they grabbed the closest thing, a bottle of teriyaki sauce, which yielded surprisingly tasty results. After the first inspired creation, Koh began to experiment with different flavor combinations, and eventually his friends suggested that he take the concept a step further. He researched different mobile food regulations and finally settled on a bright blue food truck branded with a cartoon image of his own Shiba Inu in Taiwan\u2014creating\u00a0Dojo Dog. When asked how he balances school and his new business, Koh is nonchalant. \u201cTo me, school is a good place, but I want to do more while I\u2019m still a student,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a student allows me to fund the business because I\u2019m using my living expenses and tuition money my parents gave me to do this. My parents still don\u2019t know anything about this to this day. My dream is: when they come here to visit me from Taiwan for my graduation, I\u2019m going to take them to the truck and I\u2019m going to be like, \u2018Hey, let me show you this great place, it\u2019s very delicious,\u2019 and after they\u2019ve tried it I\u2019m going to be like, \u2018That\u2019s mine.\u2019\u201d Despite the fact that Koh\u2019s father and sister are both entrepreneurs, he doubts that his parents would be supportive of his venture, which is why he\u2019s keeping his business a secret until the big surprise. \u201cThough my parents are adventurous themselves, they don\u2019t want their kids to take risks,\u201d says Koh. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very strict, and they\u2019ll call me every week to ask me how school is, how my grades are, how I did on the midterm. That\u2019s all they ask, and I just hated it. I wanted to do my own thing.\u201d Koh credits Taiwan\u2019s diverse food culture as part of the reason he is so passionate about food, though his current menu is still mainly Japanese-inspired because Americans are more familiar with Japanese ingredients. \u201cYou can have the greatest food in the world, but if people don\u2019t want to try it and are scared of it, then it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he states. However, after he establishes a strong brand image and customer base, he looks forward to expanding the menu and introducing Asian ingredients that are less familiar to the American palate. A self-professed \u201cfoodie,\u201d Koh looks forward to one day expanding Dojo Dog as part of the food truck trend, possibly into San Francisco or as a part of Off the Grid, an organized group of mobile food vendors that travels across the Bay Area (including a stop in North Berkeley) as a weekly \u201cmarket.\u201d He sees potential for his business not just as another quick bite on Upper Sproul, but as the newest Asian fusion addition to the ranks of other like-minded entrepreneurial food trucks before him. Ultimately, the driving force behind the current food truck phenomenon isn\u2019t simply that people are looking to satisfy their hunger\u2014it\u2019s that they\u2019re looking for a new experience, for an affordable adventure, for food that challenges all of their senses in the most deliciously unexpected way. Dojo Dog and other Asian fusion food trucks aim to do just that.\n","html":"<em>The rising popularity of Asian fusion cuisine within the food truck phenomenon\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em><\/em>by <strong>laurie song<\/strong>\r\n\r\nUpper Sproul is a UC Berkeley landmark usually packed with various student groups and students trying to avoid their flyers.

I never imagined myself to be the princess in my own drawings, who was likely to resemble Barbie or one of the Disney princesses. By the way, I grew up in a community where the only white persons I personally interacted with were my teachers, who did not look like Barbie or any princess. Why did the default individuals in my fantasies typically turn out to be white? It was not until my second year in college when I was engaged in a course that involved discussions on race that I began to understand how the history of America, Asian Americans, and my family played a major role in how I viewed and came to understand myself. Race is oftentimes a tense topic of discussion because it seems to be stigmatized in our society, as if we are racist or discriminatory to even consider the presence of race relations today. Recent events like Trayvon Martin\u2019s death and the California federal appeals court\u2019s rejection to lift the ban on affirmative action demonstrate how race and racism continue to be difficult topics to address or accept in our era. However, in 2011, community members of Duluth, Minnesota, came together to break this tension over racial discussion and formed the Un-Fair Campaign. The campaign\u2019s mission is \u201cTo raise awareness about white privilege in our community, provide resources for understanding action, and facilitate dialogue and partnership that result in fundamental, systemic change towards racial justice.\u201d <div>What exactly is white privilege? According to Peggy McIntosh, an American feminist and anti-racist activist who wrote \u201cWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack,\u201d white privilege is the \u201cunquestioned and unearned set of advantages, entitlements, benefits, and choices bestowed on people solely because they are white. Generally white people who experience such privilege do so without being conscious of it.\u201d An example McIntosh provides in her list from \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d is: \u201cWhether I use checks, credit cards or cash, I can count on my skin color not to work against the appearance of financial responsibility.\u201d No matter what her real strengths may be, McIntosh argues that her skin color has provided her with a set of unearned privileges. The campaign\u2019s resources include definitions, history of race in America, external sources, and links to other guides that might help in educating the public on issues of race. The campaign seems inspirational, especially coming from a community where whites make up 89 percent of the local area\u2019s population. In fact, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of the nation\u2019s most widely recognized civil rights organizations, supports the campaign as a partner. Unfortunately, the website (unfaircampaign.org) is more like a dump site for resources to \u201cfacilitate dialogue\u201d on race and to help visitor\u2019s build a beginner\u2019s level vocabulary and education on racism and structural racism, which are all necessary before one can truly grasp white privilege. I am not quite sure how the less race conscientious visitor would navigate the site and its sources\u2014or how dialogue may be possible. Furthermore, the campaign\u2019s outreach through billboards and posters can create some \u201cunfair\u201d tension. I am afraid that its publicity has the potential to do more harm than good for its goals toward racial justice and dialogue. The campaign\u2019s ambiguous and misleading outreach efforts provide potential for whites to become defensive or for persons of color to feel more silenced from conversations on race. Every billboard has a fragment of a white person\u2019s face, overlapped by the tagline \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see racism when you\u2019re white.\u201d All posters have the statement \u201cthat\u2019s unfair\u201d written on the model\u2019s face and invites bystanders to \u201cspeak up\u201d and \u201cbreak the silence\u201d if they see racism. For all outreach advertisements, the only call to action comes from the prints\u2019 direction for bystanders to visit its website. Breaking apart these posters and billboards, I take up two issues with the campaign\u2019s outreach efforts. Firstly, the way in which the statements of privilege are written above models\u2019 faces resemble the ways in which areas for corrections and changes are drawn on individuals who are about to undergo plastic surgery, or facial reconstruction. Therefore, it seems as if the advertisements are suggesting that these privileges are flaws that can be simply fixed or corrected. Secondly, these advertisements lack any connection between the privileges written on the models\u2019 faces and the actual concept of white privilege and racism. The greatest danger that can come out of this is for a bystander to view the campaign as a campaign against white people or one that raises awareness on whites as a racially oppressed group. If a bystander has never engaged herself in discussions over race or prepared himself with the basic vocabulary, a blunt \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see racism when you\u2019re white\u201d or \u201c[Insert an example of white privilege here], that\u2019s unfair\u201d can be offensive and ambiguous. Is it unfair to the white person who carries these privileges that she may not have earned or deserved? Or is it unfair to those who do not have those same privileges, even if these privileges are more like normal standards for how people should be treated? I fear that even the reasonable bystander exposed to these advertisements would miss the campaign\u2019s mission to bring the public toward a more racially just society. I also fear that someone could mistake privileges for stereotypes, or use the two interchangeably. I would not find a campaign to address the Model Minority Myth to be successful or inviting if my face had statements like \u201cI am an obedient student\u201d or \u201cI will excel at math\u201d scrawled across my face. While I appreciate the campaign\u2019s attempts to foster discussions on race and white privilege, I hope to see their publicity attempts change. From my own experience in facilitating and participating in discussions involving the topic of race and white privilege, it seemed that what really helped me and my peers understand these concepts were the literal space and facilitation for dialogue and conversations. Today, I have come out of these spaces and conversations with tools that allow me to be more conscientious about racial injustice and to be more comfortable discussing race with others. Now, I understand how white privilege in American society has been a strong influence on my childhood imaginations. The default characters of my imagination\u2019s products no longer resemble Barbie or Cinderella but take on the faces of persons of color. I have also become more sensitive toward how I perceive others without real grounds for knowing what kinds of individuals they may be. In order for the Un-Fair campaign to reach the public and generate similar paradigm shifts, I hope they reconsider the ways in which they have been approaching the conversation. As of now, I feel like only greater harm and misinformation are added to the mix through their outreach, and*\u00a0that\u2019s unfair.\u00a0*<\/div>\n","html":"<em>raising awareness about white\u00a0privilege\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\nby <strong>stephanie wong<\/strong>\r\n\r\nGrowing up, I would read novels or imagine fiction and fantasy scenarios with predominantly white characters.

Now, I understand how white privilege in American society has been a strong influence on my childhood imaginations.\r\n\r\nThe default characters of my imagination\u2019s products no longer resemble Barbie or Cinderella but take on the faces of persons of color. I have also become more sensitive toward how I perceive others without real grounds for knowing what kinds of individuals they may be.\r\n\r\nIn order for the Un-Fair campaign to reach the public and generate similar paradigm shifts, I hope they reconsider the ways in which they have been approaching the conversation. As of now, I feel like only greater harm and misinformation are added to the mix through their outreach, and<em>\u00a0that\u2019s unfair.\u00a0<\/em><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":27,"created_at":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 01:30:25 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 01:30:25 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 01:30:25 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2354,"title":"Beneath the Color of the Skin","slug":"beneath-the-color-of-the-skin","markdown":"\n*racism and the underlying struggles of Asian American\/ Pacific Islander community* by **jenny lu** I thought that in this day and age society\u2019s stereotypes and prejudiced behaviors have died down.

Movie studios have zeroed in on superhero franchises and popular graphic novels as the best bets for film adaptations with their contents\u2019 proven marketability and built-in fan bases. Even as the publishing industry precariously negotiates how to deal with digital distribution and major booksellers disappearing off street corners, comics have maintained their strong niche in the book market, weathering through the aughts with sales remaining stable and even growing.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Asians are no doubt huge players in the comic world due to the humongous impact and popularity of Japanese manga. Walk into any Borders. Low and behold, the fire hazard of people reading in the manga aisle. Yet, even with the proliferation of manga into the American mainstream consciousness, manga is a cultural import from Japan. What about Asian Americans? Where do they fit in?<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">At first glance, one wouldn\u2019t associate the American comic scene with Asian Americans. One imagines campy action comics made for the kiddies featuring muscle-y white superheroes created by white dudes hunched over their drafting desks. If you think like this though, you are completely missing out on the richness and variety of the American comic medium.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The forefathers of the American comic book were Jewish Americans composing narratives about special individuals that essentially must pass as \u201cnormal\u201d human beings and hide their Other-ness. Although these characters must bear hiding their true identities, their difference is manifested through special abilities that can help mankind. The reader\u2019s ability to relate and feel empowered speaks to the general appeal of traditional American superhero comics, but Asian Americans may particularly identify with the struggle to deal with one\u2019s own Other-ness in society.<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In conjunction with the notion that Asian culture inherently privileges the amalgamation of words and images as high art and sophisticated language, it is no wonder that there are actually tons of Asian Americans in this industry that was founded on the imaginations of social outsiders.<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Bay Area native Gene Yang, author of\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">*American Born Chinese*<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">\u00a0and more recently the canonical comic sequel to the Nickolodeon animated series<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">*Avatar: The Last Airbender*<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">, remarks, \u201cIt seems to me that there are more Asian Americans in comics than in any other American entertainment industry. It doesn't matter what kind of comics [people] read: superhero, indie, action\/adventure, young adult. Asian Americans are just all over the place. This is not true of comic book characters, however. Just creators.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Historically, traditional American comics have perpetuated negative stereotypes of Asians\/Asian Americans. Comics often manifest the sociopolitical attitudes of their time, and America certainly wasn't always so PC. The long graphic narrative form we've come to know and love blossomed in the 1930s right between the World Wars, and the American comic book hit its stride during the Cold War, an era rife with international tension. Alongside patriotic propaganda, it's really no surprise that Asians were vilified and made into grotesque caricatures, which were thoroughly documented in the 2011 NYU exhibit \u201cMonsters and Marvels: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics, 1942-1986.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The 80s and 90s marked an era when new blood helped motivate the industry to push for more culturally authentic and mature representations of characters. According to Yang during a Feb. 11th lecture at Berkeley\u2019s Fantastic Comics, the uniform bright yellow hue for all Asian characters\u2019 skin was abandoned, and characters with distinct ethnic heritages were fleshed out and given more humanity.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Asian Americans were indeed among the ranks of fresh talent and have remained an integral part of the American comic landscape.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In traditional superhero comics, there are Larry Hama (<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">*G.I.

The stories are short, but nonetheless shed much welcome light on Asian American representation in mainstream comics.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, despite the muddy political incorrectness plaguing the history of the American comic book, comics remain a potent storytelling and creative outlet for Asian Americans. In the introductory essay for the Fall 2007 volume of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States Journal, Derek Parker Royal explains, \u201cBecause of its foundational reliance on character iconography, comics are well suited to dismantle those very assumptions that problematize ethnic representation, especially as they find form in visual language.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The comic medium may lend itself stereotyping as visual cues are important, but the medium is particularly special. The image, the narrative, the spatial configuration on the page, and the reader's imagination are inextricably intertwined and actively engaged. Authors of graphic narratives have a unique relationship with their creations, therefore connecting with their audience on a very personal level.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Yang, \u201cOf the visual media - comics, film, TV, animation - it's the only one that allows one person to have complete control over everything. One person can do the writing, drawing, and even oversee the production of the physical product. Many, many cartoonists are control freaks. Especially indie cartoonists. We want that control. I think this aspect\u2014the control\u2014makes comics a very intimate medium.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">While other entertainment venues are industries trying to get the biggest bang for their buck and are not so concerned about challenging the boundaries of innovative expression, comics provide a liberating creative space for artists and storytellers to compose graphic narratives that speak to personal experiences and the universal struggles of their audience. Comics have become the creative niche for Asian Americans. APAs have long been represented in the by-lines, but not so much in the page. As the comic scene continues to diversify and more creators like Yang continue utilizing the comic medium to tell stories with authentic APA characters, we\u2019ll be able to see our true selves reflected more in the panels and the collective imagination of readers everywhere.<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">TRIVIA with Gene Yang<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">**What is your favorite depiction of an APA character in graphic novels\/comics?**<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I love Derek Kirk Kim's\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">*Same Difference*<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">.

Movie studios have zeroed in on superhero franchises and popular graphic novels as the best bets for film adaptations with their contents\u2019 proven marketability and built-in fan bases. Even as the publishing industry precariously negotiates how to deal with digital distribution and major booksellers disappearing off street corners, comics have maintained their strong niche in the book market, weathering through the aughts with sales remaining stable and even growing.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Asians are no doubt huge players in the comic world due to the humongous impact and popularity of Japanese manga. Walk into any Borders. Low and behold, the fire hazard of people reading in the manga aisle. Yet, even with the proliferation of manga into the American mainstream consciousness, manga is a cultural import from Japan. What about Asian Americans? Where do they fit in?<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">At first glance, one wouldn\u2019t associate the American comic scene with Asian Americans. One imagines campy action comics made for the kiddies featuring muscle-y white superheroes created by white dudes hunched over their drafting desks. If you think like this though, you are completely missing out on the richness and variety of the American comic medium.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The forefathers of the American comic book were Jewish Americans composing narratives about special individuals that essentially must pass as \u201cnormal\u201d human beings and hide their Other-ness. Although these characters must bear hiding their true identities, their difference is manifested through special abilities that can help mankind. The reader\u2019s ability to relate and feel empowered speaks to the general appeal of traditional American superhero comics, but Asian Americans may particularly identify with the struggle to deal with one\u2019s own Other-ness in society.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In conjunction with the notion that Asian culture inherently privileges the amalgamation of words and images as high art and sophisticated language, it is no wonder that there are actually tons of Asian Americans in this industry that was founded on the imaginations of social outsiders.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Bay Area native Gene Yang, author of\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em>American Born Chinese<\/em><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">\u00a0and more recently the canonical comic sequel to the Nickolodeon animated series<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender<\/em><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">, remarks, \u201cIt seems to me that there are more Asian Americans in comics than in any other American entertainment industry. It doesn't matter what kind of comics [people] read: superhero, indie, action\/adventure, young adult. Asian Americans are just all over the place. This is not true of comic book characters, however. Just creators.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Historically, traditional American comics have perpetuated negative stereotypes of Asians\/Asian Americans. Comics often manifest the sociopolitical attitudes of their time, and America certainly wasn't always so PC. The long graphic narrative form we've come to know and love blossomed in the 1930s right between the World Wars, and the American comic book hit its stride during the Cold War, an era rife with international tension. Alongside patriotic propaganda, it's really no surprise that Asians were vilified and made into grotesque caricatures, which were thoroughly documented in the 2011 NYU exhibit \u201cMonsters and Marvels: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics, 1942-1986.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The 80s and 90s marked an era when new blood helped motivate the industry to push for more culturally authentic and mature representations of characters. According to Yang during a Feb. 11th lecture at Berkeley\u2019s Fantastic Comics, the uniform bright yellow hue for all Asian characters\u2019 skin was abandoned, and characters with distinct ethnic heritages were fleshed out and given more humanity.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Asian Americans were indeed among the ranks of fresh talent and have remained an integral part of the American comic landscape.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In traditional superhero comics, there are Larry Hama (<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em>G.I.

The stories are short, but nonetheless shed much welcome light on Asian American representation in mainstream comics.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, despite the muddy political incorrectness plaguing the history of the American comic book, comics remain a potent storytelling and creative outlet for Asian Americans. In the introductory essay for the Fall 2007 volume of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States Journal, Derek Parker Royal explains, \u201cBecause of its foundational reliance on character iconography, comics are well suited to dismantle those very assumptions that problematize ethnic representation, especially as they find form in visual language.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The comic medium may lend itself stereotyping as visual cues are important, but the medium is particularly special. The image, the narrative, the spatial configuration on the page, and the reader's imagination are inextricably intertwined and actively engaged. Authors of graphic narratives have a unique relationship with their creations, therefore connecting with their audience on a very personal level.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Yang, \u201cOf the visual media - comics, film, TV, animation - it's the only one that allows one person to have complete control over everything. One person can do the writing, drawing, and even oversee the production of the physical product. Many, many cartoonists are control freaks. Especially indie cartoonists. We want that control. I think this aspect\u2014the control\u2014makes comics a very intimate medium.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">While other entertainment venues are industries trying to get the biggest bang for their buck and are not so concerned about challenging the boundaries of innovative expression, comics provide a liberating creative space for artists and storytellers to compose graphic narratives that speak to personal experiences and the universal struggles of their audience. Comics have become the creative niche for Asian Americans. APAs have long been represented in the by-lines, but not so much in the page. As the comic scene continues to diversify and more creators like Yang continue utilizing the comic medium to tell stories with authentic APA characters, we\u2019ll be able to see our true selves reflected more in the panels and the collective imagination of readers everywhere.<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">TRIVIA with Gene Yang<\/span><\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><strong>What is your favorite depiction of an APA character in graphic novels\/comics?<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\r\n<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I love Derek Kirk Kim's\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><em>Same Difference<\/em><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">.

So, to what extent is it valid that \u201conly API women and queer men organize?\u201d What is it that makes heterosexual API men so uncomfortable\u2014or, is it that they are too comfortable, and\u00a0thus unwilling to fight for anything? In this feature, we endeavor to\u00a0answer these questions and explore the curious intersectionality\u00a0of straight-identified, male-identified, and API in truehardboiled\u00a0fashion\u2014with a facetious beefcake spread. Without further ado,\u00a0hardboiled\u00a0magazine proudly presents our inaugural class of\u00a0hard men\u00a0for\u00a0hardboiled.\u00a0(Disclaimer: We\u00a0assume no liability for any readers burning their fingers, because\u00a0these pages are way too hot. You have been warned.) <\/div>**JU HONG** 4th year \u2022 Political Science Major \u2022 Alameda, CA Why we love him: Aside from being a CalSERVE senator, Ju is actively involved with Rising Immigrant Scholars through Education (RISE) and Asian Students Promoting Immigrant Rights through Education (ASPIRE). Why do you do what you do?: As an undocumented student, I am passionate about fighting for immigrant rights issues and advocating for the underprivileged immigrant community at large. What gets you hard?: As a first-generation AB540 transfer student, I understand the sacrifice one has to make in order to pursuit of a higher education. Thus, I am passionate about providing equal access to higher education to all students regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, or immigration status. What is your ideal girl like?: Anyone who has the U.S. citizenship status. :] **BRYAN MAEKAWA** 4th year \u2022 Asian Studies Major \u2022 Los Angeles, CA Why we love him: Bryan organizes with the Nikkei Student Union, Asian Pacific American Student Development Office, and Asian Pacific American Coalition. Why do you do what you do?: Though I have been fortunate enough to have been born with many privileges, I too have felt the pain and indignity of discrimination in my life, and I want to confront all forms of this injustice in order to see a more equitable society. Do you think a gender imbalance exists within API progressive spaces?: I have never really felt that there was a gender imbalance. I understand the logic behind such a belief being that men, benefiting from male privilege, have more life advantages and are thus less inclined to be motivated to fight for anything. Fortunately however, I have met and been inspired by many heterosexual men who are passionate about social justice. Perhaps this is due to the positive influence of API womyn? Or maybe it\u2019s thanks to having such role models like Richard Aoki, Mike Honda, and Jere Takahashi? What\u2019s one thing someone can do to win your heart?: Make me laugh. People with a good sense of humor are always fun to be around. **MICHAEL MURATA** 3rd year \u2022 Bioengineering Major \u2022 Asian American Studies Minor \u2022 Los Angeles, CA Why we love him: Michael is an officer in the Nikkei Student Union and serves on the board of directors for the Japanese American Citizen\u2019s League. He also is one of the student coordinators for the Asian American and Pacific Islander Health Research Group. Shameless plug: if you are interested in API\u2019s and health, check out[www.aapihrg.berkeley.edu](http:\/\/www.aapihrg.berkeley.edu\/). What gets you hard?: I am very passionate about eliminating disparities in health, particularly those due to racial issues.\u00a0 Health and medicine have been interests of mine for many years and so I combined them with my passion for the community by focusing on community health whether it be physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, or something that cannot be categorized! Do you think a gender imbalance exists within API progressive spaces?: To be honest, I did not stop to think about whether there was a gender imbalance in API spaces or not.\u00a0 I have felt comfortable with and supported by the people I have worked with and most of the focus has been directed towards the issues at hand. What\u2019s one thing someone can do to win your heart?: I\u2019m not really sure what someone could do to win my heart, but one girl figured it out and I have been ridiculously happy being with her ever since. **NHAN VU** 3rd Year \u2022 Environmental Economics and Policy Major \u2022 Reseda, CA Why we love him: Nhan is involved with SASC, the Southeast Asian Student Coalition, as an Internal Relations co-chair and a Summer Institute co-chair. Previously he has been a REACH! Coordinator. and has also been involved with VSA and PAA. Why do you do what you do?: This is my passion. I do this because I never had a mentor growing up, so I had a void within me. It wasn't until I went to college that I realized how important a mentor was. For me, there are few things greater than a smile on a mentee's face when they realize they can\u00a0 believe\u00a0 in themselves. What gets you hard?: Access to higher education is an API issue that I am really passionate about. API youth have so much potential, but there are many distractions that could deter them from staying on the path. The best thing you can do for a mentee is to make them believe in themselves. Once they have that self-confidence they can begin to challenge the inequalities and injustices that they face in order to transcend the expectations placed on them. What is your ideal girl like?: My ideal girl is someone who is confident about herself. She could be the most awkward human being, but as long as she is comfortable with who she is as a person, I think that is the sexiest thing ever. **JEFFREY PU\u00a0** 4th year \u2022 Asian American Studies Major \u2022 Political Science Major \u2022 Monterey Park, CA Why we love him: Jeffrey is a hard man actually FROM hardboiled, and while we love men in suits, what we love are men who are always in bold. (Check his feature on {M}agenda Magazine\u2019s Invisible Runway out on page 5!) Do you think a gender imbalance exists in API progressive spaces?: I would agree that there exists a gender imbalance within API progressive spaces. I mean, that's part of the reason why this feature exists right? While I'm sure there are a number of reasons why this is the case, some of which are beyond my analysis, I definitely believe there are many elements of our socio-historical context that play into the privileges and attitudes that lead to our own political apathy. This apathy stems from a combination of many different factors with race, gender and class fulfilling just part of the list. What gets you hard?: As a college student, API in higher education remains an issue that is very salient to me, including issues related to access, the model minority and stereotyping. One simple manifestation of all of these is the simple question of why so many members of our communities are involved in majors that are supposed to lead to middle-class, white collar professional jobs and what are the implications of that for the rest of our community? What\u2019s one thing a girl can do to win your heart? I suppose what a girl could do to win my heart is to just spend time with me. But dinner at a nice restaurant and a love of Star Wars couldn't hurt. ;P **KENNY KIM HOANG** 2nd year \u2022 Rhetoric Major \u2022 Social Welfare Major \u2022 Lawndale, CA Why we love him: Kenny is REACH\u2019s Outreach Co-Coordinator and SASC\u2019s Anthology Co-Chair, working to recruit underrepresented APIs into higher education and document the stories of families impacted by the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam War, and Secret War in Laos. Why do you do what you do?: Love. Do you think there is a gender imbalance in API progressive spaces?:\u00a0 I would agree that a gender imbalance in API progressive spaces does exist. I think that API straight men do not get involved in community organizing spaces as much as women and queer individuals because there are a lot of straight API men out there who are not knowledgeable about the disparities, disservice, and injustices that target them. Perhaps the experience of a straight man differs largely from a women and the experience of queer men where a straight man does not see the immediacy and importance of progressive spaces. This kind-of nuance of male privilege plays off unrecorded and indirectly perpetuates the representation as it keeps stagnant. Therefore most straight API men are never even given the chance to consider community organizing yet alone work in progressive spaces. What gets you hard?: One API issue that I\u2019m passionate about is the lack of an API narrative in the the K-12 education system. The realization of how the API community has been disenfranchised in history, in struggle, in voice is what drives my passion to diminish these inequalities. Would you rather give flowers or chocolate?: Flowers. My mom looked overwhelmed the last time I snuck a bouquet on the living room table.\n","html":"<div>\r\n\r\nby <strong>denise wong<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the most prevalent criticisms of the often\u00a0hyperglorified Asian American movement is the degree of dominance Asian American men had\u2014more specifically,\u00a0heterosexual Asian American men.

I knew nothing about Chinese dance, or just dancing in general - I couldn't even do the Time Warp Dance at Calso! I think I got a little intimidated, because after the first week I tried to drop the class. As fate would have it, I was an idiot and missed the drop deadline *by a day*. Fast forward to now, 3 months later - I couldn't have been happier for my mistake! As it turns out, most people in the decal knew nothing about dancing, either. Sure, you've got that small number of experienced dancers who make every move look *so darn easy - *but for the most part, Beginning Chinese Dance was just that - BEGINNING Chinese Dance. Everyone in the class was there to let loose and have fun (absolutely necessary in a high-stress environment like Cal!). By the end of the semester, I'd not only learned a [Tibetan laundry dance](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qCJ43kX3DoU)\u00a0and a [Dai spring dance](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nKia3CT-lXU)\u00a0- I'd learned about the language, customs, and food of 7 Chinese ethnic groups as well. Not bad for 2 hours a week, right? In any case, the FTD showcase last night was great.

I think I got a little intimidated, because after the first week I tried to drop the class. As fate would have it, I was an idiot and missed the drop deadline <em>by a day<\/em>. Fast forward to now, 3 months later - I couldn't have been happier for my mistake!\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, most people in the decal knew nothing about dancing, either. Sure, you've got that small number of experienced dancers who make every move look <em>so darn easy - <\/em>but for the most part, Beginning Chinese Dance was just that - BEGINNING Chinese Dance. Everyone in the class was there to let loose and have fun (absolutely necessary in a high-stress environment like Cal!). By the end of the semester, I'd not only learned a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qCJ43kX3DoU\" target=\"_blank\">Tibetan laundry dance<\/a>\u00a0and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nKia3CT-lXU\" target=\"_blank\">Dai spring dance<\/a>\u00a0- I'd learned about the language, customs, and food of 7 Chinese ethnic groups as well. Not bad for 2 hours a week, right?\r\n\r\nIn any case, the FTD showcase last night was great.

This is not true given the fact that Pew (and other researchers) have used median household income to calculate wealth. This doesn't exactly work because Asian families tend to have more income earners. In addition, Asian tend to live on the coasts where the cost of living, and therefore wages, are generally higher. Plus, factors like the \"bamboo ceiling\" may prevent very high incomes among Asian Americans, which can't be represented through median household income. The Asian Americans being happier with themselves and the state of the nation may not be true. Remember, Asian Americans live in places like the Silicon Valley and New York where the satisfaction with how the country is going and their own lives is better than the American Heartland. If Asians started to congregate on Youngstown, Ohio, the answers maybe different. Moreover,\u00a0satisfaction with how the nation is doing might be linked to the fact that Asian lean democrat and we have a Barack Obama in office, which is illustrated by Obama's approval by Asians as stated in the same report. In addition, the report fails to state mental health issues within the Asian American community, like the fact that young Asian American women have the highest rates\u00a0of depression. The study explicitly wanted to test the Amy Chua hypothesis if Asians or \"Americans\" place too much to succeed academically. The study found that more than half of BOTH Asian Americans and \"Americans\" think that \"Americans\" put not enough pressure for their kids to succeed academically and only 10% thought they put too much pressure. However, 40% of Asian Americans thought that people in their respective ethnic groups place too much pressure on education (although only 20% of Filipinos and Japanese thought their ethnic group placed too much pressure on education). **However**, what this tells ME is that Asian Americans are self-aware about how much pressure they are putting on children academically, and in the future, parents and future parents will lessen this pressure and allow children to cultivate other aspects of their lives. In addition, academic success doesn't always mean success in the long run. Many in the Silicon Valley are starting to question the value of academic success, including [Peter Thiel, who is offering $100,000 in grant money for DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE.](http:\/\/www.thielfellowship.org\/)\u00a0After discussing this topic with industry professionals at a local corporate event, they agree with Peter Thiel, that young men and women should start applying what they learn as soon as possible.\u00a0Although I don't fully agree with this sentiment, it does highlight the limitations of formal education. The study also glanced over \"other Asians.\" They did mention that \"other Asians\" had a poverty rate of 17%, much higher than overall populace, but failed to delve into the topic as they did with the success of other Asian subgroups. There were some other really interesting data within the survey results which the report glanced over. Like Asian Americans are more willing to have bigger government with more services. This maybe because Asian Americans generally lean towards the left, or the fact that Asian Americans do rely on, if not welfare services, than government services in general. This goes against the Horatio Alger, \"bring'em up by the bootstrap\" rhetoric of the report. Contrary to what the report says, apparently Asians like to have fun too! 57% of Asian Americans think free time as a very important or one of the most important aspect of their lives, compared to 53% of the general population. By far, Koreans actually are the most likely to place emphasis on free time [insert Starcraft joke here]. The cherry on top is this sentence from the report: *When newly minted **medical school graduate Priscilla Chan married **Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg last **month, she joined the 37% of all recent Asian American brides who wed a non-Asian groom.*\n\n**I think I shat myself when I read that.

By the way, this post has nothing to do with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xojane.com\/it-happened-to-me\/asian-woman-dating-asian-men-jenny-an\">this\u00a0inflammatory article<\/a>. Nope. Not at all.\r\n\r\nI am an Asian man. I don't date pathetic mortals. Yep, I'm one of those who just\u00a0masturbates all day long.\r\n\r\nWhy? It's simple: I'm a racist.\r\n\r\nWait, that's not quite right . . . Why? It's simple: I'm a misogynist. Nope, still not it. Why? It's simple: I'm a homophobe . . . nope.\r\n\r\nGot it . . .\r\n\r\nWhy? It's simple: I'm a misanthrope.\r\n\r\nYep, I said it.\r\n\r\nGuess what? I'm not alone. Male Asian douchebags like me roam the UC Berkeley campus all the time. We are everywhere (and no where) at the same time. You know that bro swaggerin' his Haas backpack on Sproul Plaza? Yeah, that's me. You know that EECS major who just can't stop talking about how hard his classes are? That's me too. We're the jerks on campus that make fun of your funny little liberal arts majors. \"Humanities? You mean humani-tities!\"\u00a0Most importantly, we refuse to display any emotional empathy, sexual desires, or what you humans call \"altruistic behavior.\"\r\n\r\nThis trend has nothing to do with humans possessing organic, carbon based skins. It has something to do with our God-given misogynistic nature mixed with the fact we are scientifically incapable of sustaining a long-term (and short-term and medium-term) sexual relationship with other humans. Apparently this innate patriarchy has turned off quite a many Asian and non-Asian women (and men for that matter). We would rather spend quality time with our math textbooks than stinky humans.

Before I came to Berkeley, I knew nothing about the struggle to establish academic departments that focused on the history of minorities.

What I will not ignore is that the same journalist who tirelessly pursued five lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act was never able to conduct more than two telephone interviews with Aoki, none in person. In response to my question on whether Aoki's condition prevented him from meeting with Rosenfeld one-on-one, Rosenfeld said, \"I don't know.\" I guess that as long as Aoki was alive, Rosenfeld could do little with the cryptic responses he was able to draw out. Granted, Rosenfeld deserves credit for doing the research and analysis, but ultimately his statement of Aoki leaves much to the imagination. Why include Aoki in the book if no concrete, comprehensive data shows what type of information he passed on (if he did work as an informant) to the FBI?

In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, students will research and develop story ideas, compose layouts, and distribute issues to students, faculty, and community members. hardboiled publishes two print issues per semester, and throughout the DeCal, students will be expected to participate in weekly workshops that will enhance their knowledge of investigative journalism, Adobe InDesign, and pressing issues in the API community. As a professional newsmagazine, hardboiled not only produces over 3,400 copies per semester covering timely and insightful topics for the campus and greater community, but also provides staff with a community of like-minded students active in the APA community to learn about issues and engage in meaningful discussion. Students will receive an introduction to the local and off-campus Asian Pacific American communities through opportunities to meet community leaders, attend and participate in community organizations and events, and be a part of UC Berkeley\u2019s Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC), a coalition of APA organizations on campus.

In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, students will research and develop story ideas, compose layouts, and distribute issues to students, faculty, and community members. hardboiled publishes two print issues per semester, and throughout the DeCal, students will be expected to participate in weekly workshops that will enhance their knowledge of investigative journalism, Adobe InDesign, and pressing issues in the API community. As a professional newsmagazine, hardboiled not only produces over 3,400 copies per semester covering timely and insightful topics for the campus and greater community, but also provides staff with a community of like-minded students active in the APA community to learn about issues and engage in meaningful discussion.\r\nStudents will receive an introduction to the local and off-campus Asian Pacific American\r\ncommunities through opportunities to meet community leaders, attend and participate in\r\ncommunity organizations and events, and be a part of UC Berkeley\u2019s Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC), a coalition of APA organizations on campus.

The birth of Communist China was an undeniable step away from the violated, impoverished and war-torn China that defined the preceding century. I specifically use the term \"violated\" because it is what best describes the British empire\u2019s smuggling of opium into China during the 18th century, an action which incapacitated millions and led to the Opium Wars, the cession of Hong Kong, and the desecration of the Summer Palace in 1860. This theme of foreign violation continued into the 20th century and culminated in the invasion of the Japanese during World War II and the massacre that was the Rape of Nanking. Therefore, it was not prosperity or even peace that Mao Zedong declared; rather, it was the existence of a fighting spirit\u2014China would never again be held at the mercy of others. This commitment to reconstruction and a renewal of strength, while certainly not a justification for the pains of the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward, no doubt promised the possibility of a future where prosperity and peace would be attainable. But why does this matter to me? Why is it that my eyes cloud up when I read about the tumultuous history that the Chinese people have lived through though I was born and educated in America? Why did I feel an overwhelming wave of pride when I watched the opening ceremony for the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008? I certainly did not live through these past sixty years of development, nor have I ever fought or suffered for China. But, I suppose, my existence is a result of this history and so I have always felt a natural sense of profound gratitude and devotion toward the motherland of my parents. This, I am sure, is also nourished by my close relationship with my mother, who has allowed me to live somewhat vicariously through her experiences. Mine is a unique and somewhat unsettling point of view to have as an American. While bookstores carry titles exposing the atrocities of the Mao era, I see the same time through my mother\u2019s eyes. As a junior high student, my mother eagerly volunteered to be shipped to the rural countryside to work as a farmer. Life was harsh and her education was significantly delayed, but what she remembers most prominently is the kindness and humbleness of the villagers she lived with and the camaraderie that existed among the youths. Similarly, though Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party are widely vilified in \"Western\" culture, the choices of my grandparents have taught me that no situation is as simple as it seems. Coming from a well-off and politically active background, my father\u2019s family suffered immensely during the Cultural Revolution. They were stripped of their belongings, publicly humiliated at rallies, and thrown into prison because they were seen as deviants and threats to the accepted ideology. Yet, until her death in Beijing, my grandmother\u2019s devotion to the Communist Party, her country, and its potential has never wavered. It seems she has always seen a China beyond that of Mao\u2019s shadow and the actions of the few (though in China that may mean millions); choosing to observe and trust in the macroscopic direction of positivity China is progressing towards instead of condemning the government for its failures, though she has every reason to do so. It is with this multi-generational and cautious perspective that I view the current media coverage of the political and ethnic clashes in Tibet and Xinjiang that have come to define the West\u2019s perspective of China. While I am in no position to dispute facts reported about specific incidents, what I do notice is an extreme lack of both historical and present-day context in the reports. For example, though the handling of the Uighur uprising was bloody and may have been oppressive, what is China\u2019s general policy on minority issues? I am certainly no expert on this matter, but what I do know is that minorities are not subject to the One-Child regulation and are encouraged via an affirmative action of sorts to pursue higher education\u2014none of which has been reported or even disproved by the media. This selective representation of China is unjust and particularly influential. Though the Chinese government is itself a master manipulator of the media, it has little power to manipulate the American image because American pop culture is so incredibly pervasive and self-propagating. Conversely, American information about China is almost always filtered through what media sources decide to report. This is particularly dangerous, as it leads to an insensitivity and lack of understanding of the Chinese people\u2019s perspective and does not particularly facilitate a desire to learn more. To illustrate this, last semester, recognizing my own biases, I found myself quite enthused to attend the Dalai Lama\u2019s visit to Berkeley in an effort to better understand the person whom the \"West\" so fervently supports in the issue of Tibet. I did not expect to first be presented with a speech by Sharon Stone, who had in previous months made the statement, without apology, that the Sichuan Earthquake which killed over 68,000 people was in fact a result of \"Karma. When you\u2019re not nice then bad things happen to you.\" Suffice it to say, it was difficult to sustain a neutral opinion for the remainder of the program, as I felt angered and disappointed in the organizers of the event. If the same comments had been made about 9\/11 or Hurricane Katrina, such a person would never have been invited to instruct virtue. October 1, 2009 is the sixtieth anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the government has planned an enormous parade to take place in Beijing. Being an American, it is almost like a coming out of the closet experience for me to admit that I am immensely proud of the progress China has made these past sixty years. Stripping away the controversies and continuous strife, what is evident is that the majority of people in China have food to put on the table and a sense of newfound opportunity\u2014this is a feat in itself. As a nation that has \"stood up\" from a state of decay, China must continue to be progressive and handle its deficiencies and faults with the responsibility of a major member of the global community. In return, China must be viewed critically, constructively, and within the context of the ashes it has risen from.\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0<em>Countries are not black or white, red or blue, but only shades of gray<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><\/em>\nby <strong>jasmine wang<\/strong><\/p>\nSixty years ago on October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the beginning of the People\u2019s Republic of China with the words, China \"has stood up.\" Though hindsight shows us that the coming decades would be filled with uncertainty, intense struggle and cruelty, these words were nevertheless appropriate for the time.\n\nThe birth of Communist China was an undeniable step away from the violated, impoverished and war-torn China that defined the preceding century.

Even though the Asian American community is still in the process of being seen as a civically engaged and active demographic, it has the great potential to be heard. One in six Asian Americans today live in a swing state, with Asian Americans making up 9% of the population in Nevada and almost 7% of that in Virginia. While those numbers may not seem impressive at first glance, keep in mind that Obama is currently leading by only 1% in Nevada while Romney leads by the same percentage in Virginia as of the latest polls \u2013 differences so small that they are quite literally still within the margin of error. Add the fact that over 30% of Asian Americans remain undecided in this race, three to four times higher than the national average of undecided voters, and it is clear the undecided Asian American voter has the potential to be a powerful game changer. Asian Americans are also the fastest growing minority in the United States (at an astonishing rate of 46% per year) and have a higher tendency than other groups to vote based on individual issues, rather than hard party lines. Asian Americans remain a group largely ignored in this presidential race \u2013 and in general. A survey done this May shows that only 23% of Asian Americans have been contacted by the Democratic Party in the past two years and only 17% by the Republican Party \u2013 low numbers especially for a group with such high numbers of undecided voters. Furthermore, Asian American underrepresentation in both parties is also appalling. Asian Americans consist of about 6% of the United States population. One would expect that the House of Representatives would reasonably reflect America\u2019s demographics with about 26 representatives out of a total of 435. The reality? Only seven API Representatives. It doesn\u2019t take much math to see the problem. So, why are we so underrepresented and ignored? Sure, it may be partially because the Asian American voting bloc is not a very unified one due to its diversity, as evidenced by varying levels of support for each candidate (Indian Americans overwhelmingly support Obama, whileFilipino Americans are slightly more in favor of Romney). But, the real problem is something you probably have already noticed and is largely our own fault. It\u2019s simple, really. Most Asian Americans just don\u2019t really vote. In fact, only 47% of Asian Americans turned out to vote in the 2008 presidential election, the lowest among all ethnic groups \u2013 and Asian American voter turnout has consistently been the lowest for decades. If we aren\u2019t going to vote anyway, our votes don\u2019t matter. According to the Asian American Survey conducted in April 2012 by the Lake Research Partners, APIA Vote, the Asian American Justice Center, and the Asian American Institute, the main reasons for not voting in 2008 were: ineligibility (36%), out of country\/state (13%), no time (10%), didn\u2019t know enough about candidates (7%), and didn\u2019t like candidates (6%). However, it\u2019s important to note that the ineligible voters who made up 36% weren\u2019t even counted when calculating the Asian American voter turnout. So, yes, only 47% of eligible Asian American voters voted in 2008. For a community in which a third isn\u2019t even currently eligible to vote and make up less than 10% of the overall population, those numbers are extremely low. If we even hope to make our voices heard, this is not the way to do it. It really comes down to this. Do you care about how your tax dollars are spent? Do you want issues such as health resources and immigration to be reflective of the demands of the Asian American community? If so, you have to vote. In the end, civic participation is essential to getting the representation we need \u2013 and deserve.

In the space, we aim to provide academic and social support to current students through the implementation of educational discussions, social activities, and community involvements. Through these efforts, students are able to explore, learn, and think more critically about Hmong culture, history, and contemporary issues. For fall 2012, we will hold meetings on the first Wednesday of every month from 7 to 9 pm that are open to the community. Every meeting covers a specific topic based on the interest of the Hmong community and members: for example, the most recent session on October 3 revolved around the origins of Hmong people and their migration patterns throughout Asia. The organization works alongside with other Asian Pacific Islander (API) groups on campus to provide a safe and confidential space for individuals to voice their concerns and opinions on issues that affect their lives. In addition to academics and education, we also hold social events in which we hope to provide support for students by keeping them involved and motivated. These types of bonding provide students with the opportunity to meet their peers. This spring of 2013, we will be holding our 5th annual The Pursuit of Higher Education (PoHE), a three-day, two-night high school program in which we bring 36 participants specifically from the Central and Northern region of California to the UC Berkeley campus. The vision for PoHE this year is to create a sustainable high school program in which we can provide continual support and resources to all participants. PoHE aims to promote higher education through various academic and cultural workshops. In addition, students will get the opportunity to participate in peer-bonding activities, learn more about the Hmong culture, develop leadership skills, and create mentor-mentee relationships. Most of the high school students who participate in this program come from underrepresented and under-resourced communities. For most of them, it is the only opportunity to connect with college students and be exposed to a college campus, and we are very honored to be a part of this important event. We want to continue to build a stronger and more supportive space for the community. Therefore, in the future we hope to establish a stronger economic and social foundation in order to provide continuous support and resources such as scholarships, networking and professional skills for our community.\n\n\n","html":"by HSAB cabinet members\r\n\r\nThe Hmong Student Association at Berkeley (HSAB) is a student-initiated service group created in 2008 with the mission to bring cultural awareness of the Hmong community, retain current students, and increase the enrollment of prospective students into higher education.

This means that the \"facts\" that Seth Rosenfeld presents in his book *Subversives* are not going to be accepted without a thorough investigation and analysis from community members. Rosenfeld's claims rest primarily on the testimony of deceased FBI agent \u00a0Burney Threadgill, heavily redacted FBI documents on Richard Aoki, and M. Wesley Swearingen, a former FBI agent. A portion of the conversation Rosenfeld has with Threadgill is available online, and we are only able to hear what we are told is Threadgill's voice, saying \"Oh yeah, he was a character. He said 'I don't have any interest in communism,' and I said, 'Well why don't you just go to some of the meetings and tell me who's there and what they talked about?'\" We have no way of knowing whether or not it is actually Threadgill speaking, and the context of the conversation is only provided by Rosenfeld. Additionally, Rosenfeld claims that Threadgill brought up Aoki after seeing his name on an FBI document in 2002; however, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) states that it does not disclose any information about any person in their records, unless that person is already deceased. Aoki passed away on March 15, 2009 \u2013 which means that Aoki's name should not have been included in the FBI document that Rosenfeld claimed he possessed. Redacted information in the released FBI files on Aoki clearly demonstrates the type of censorship and level of privacy provided for people that are still living. While we are still on the subject of the FOIA and redacted information, I would like to point out that because of the heavy censorship throughout Aoki's FBI file, we are unable to conclude what kind of information Aoki supposedly furnished, and who was actually involved. Because of this, it's hard to say whether Aoki was actually an informant \u2013 or being informed on. There are inconsistencies throughout the FBI file that make it appear as if Aoki were being informed on, rather than being the informant. For example, on page 53 of the FBI file, it states that Aoki is of \"Korean\" descent, incorrectly listing his ethnicity. A second example is on page 242, or AOKI-246, dated December 29, 1972. Rosenfeld states that on this particular report, Aoki is reminded to report his income from the FBI on his tax return in a hand-written notation, which is not actually present on the document. Along with the incorrect references throughout the document, Rosenfeld constructs data that never really existed. During his short interview with Aoki, he claims that Aoki stated, \u201cPeople change. It is complex, layer upon layer,\u201d in response to Rosenfeld\u2019s question about whether or not he was an FBI informant. Upon listening to the actual recording, one finds that what Aoki may have been referring to is ambiguous. Although Rosenfeld claims that the words were in the exchange immediately before the others, the transcript of the conversation never has Aoki saying that at all, despite Rosenfeld\u2019s claims. Instead, listening to the recorded conversation gives it different context than what his book makes it out to be. It is clear that Rosenfeld is at least somewhat guilty of manipulating his findings in order for them to resonate with his arguments. Rosenfeld\u2019s self-proclaimed evidence has too many cracks for it to be considered admissible. Twisting the information on Aoki only serves to increase the sales for his book, *Subversives* \u2013 which, admittedly, piqued the interest of many students and community members alike. It is unfair for Aoki\u2019s legacy to be damaged in such a way, and Rosenfeld\u2019s information is barely circumstantial evidence at best. While Rosenfeld\u2019s research may have come to the conclusion that Aoki worked as an FBI informant, it is inconclusive in determining whether or not this had an impact on the most important aspects of Richard Aoki\u2019s legacy. The 1960s was a period where the government was obsessively suspicious of any and all \u201cradical\u201d groups, and considering that FBI agent Burney Threadgill claimed that he first found out about Aoki via wiretap, it is very possible that Aoki was being monitored long before he supposedly became an informant. Today, the notion of being an FBI informant may seem absurd, but back in the sixties, it was likely that it did not bear the same weight. Aoki\u2019s legacy should continue to live on, despite the negative media surrounding the allegations brought up in *Subversives*.\n\n\n","html":"As Berkeley students, it is our responsibility to find the truth \u2013 no matter how difficult it is for us to acknowledge.

In *Chinglish*, he takes a more lighthearted comedic look at how *guanxi*\u2014personal relationships\u2014can drive both business and private interactions in China. Hwang explains his inspiration for *Chinglish*, which comes from his personal experiences: \u201cChina has become very interested in Broadway-style shows. And I\u2019m the only even nominally Chinese person who\u2019s ever written a Broadway show so I started to be called over for a lot of different meetings. And I think that *Chinglish* the play comes out of my trying to deal with what it means to do business in China, and the things I understood, and the things I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d *\u00a0**Chinglish*, directed by Leigh Silverman and produced by the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, is full of snappy, quick-witted dialogue that effortlessly transcends language barriers through the universal language of comedy. Because a significant portion of the dialogue is spoken in Mandarin Chinese, English supertitles are projected onto the set, often to amusing and contradictory effect. The scenic design\u2014set in Guiyang, China\u2014is impressively coordinated, with sleek transitions between sets accompanied by snippets of pop music by Taiwanese American musician Wang Leehom. Cast members include Michelle Krusiec, whose varied filmography includes a leading role in *Saving Face* and numerous film and TV appearances, as Xi Yan, the \u201csuspiciously sexy bureaucrat\u201d; Alex Moggridge as Daniel, the American businessman; Celeste Den as Miss Qian, a well-meaning but comically inaccurate interpreter; Brian Nishii as Peter, a British expatriate in China; and Larry Lei Zhang as Minister Cai of the local Guiyang government. Though advertisements for *Chinglish* portray the play as a farce\u2014a comedy full of hilarious linguistic misinterpretations, cultural misunderstandings, and sex\u2014I find the message behind the madness far more interesting. Hwang makes incisive points about what it means to do business in a globalized economy in which the U.S. is no longer the sole superpower, and in which China is emerging as a land of perceived entrepreneurial opportunity. For instance, when Daniel becomes frustrated with Xi Yan\u2019s limited English, Xi Yan asks him why she should speak English and why he cannot learn to speak Chinese instead, revealing the double standard present in these exchanges. Hwang also highlights the cultural differences that ultimately prove more difficult to bridge than the permeable language barrier. Most notably, he portrays this through the characters of Minister Cai and Peter, the British expatriate who serves as Daniel\u2019s \u201cconsultant\u201d\u2014his linguistic and cultural translator. Hwang frames the underlying dissonance between the older Chinese generation from the Cultural Revolution and the younger generation within the context of politics and internationality. Though Minister Cai, a Communist Party member, seems to hold the key to doing business in Guiyang, it is later revealed that the navigation of *guanxi* is far more complex than either he or Peter could have imagined: when you play the game of personal connections and the owing of favors, the boundaries between legality and corruption become blurred. Surprisingly, the two\u2014despite their generational and national differences\u2014find mutual (and somewhat ironic) ground in their nostalgia for an idealized China of the past, for Chinese operas and army days left behind in the wake of China\u2019s rise. In *Chinglish*, David Henry Hwang interprets modern China\u2019s continual political and cultural transformation\u2014in which both Chinese and Westerners often find themselves lost\u2014through the lens of personal relationships and comedy.

Though Minister Cai, a Communist Party member, seems to hold the key to doing business in Guiyang, it is later revealed that the navigation of <em>guanxi<\/em> is far more complex than either he or Peter could have imagined: when you play the game of personal connections and the owing of favors, the boundaries between legality and corruption become blurred. Surprisingly, the two\u2014despite their generational and national differences\u2014find mutual (and somewhat ironic) ground in their nostalgia for an idealized China of the past, for Chinese operas and army days left behind in the wake of China\u2019s rise.\r\n\r\nIn <em>Chinglish<\/em>, David Henry Hwang interprets modern China\u2019s continual political and cultural transformation\u2014in which both Chinese and Westerners often find themselves lost\u2014through the lens of personal relationships and comedy. Sharp, intriguing, and fast-paced, <em>Chinglish<\/em> is a play that has the audience laughing at the theatre and pondering its message all the way home.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":66,"created_at":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 14:25:46 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 14:25:46 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 14:25:46 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2553,"title":"The Moral Model Minority","slug":"the-moral-model-minority","markdown":"\nby nate lee It may come as a surprise that most of the tables that line Sproul Plaza these days belong not to political groups, racial solidarity groups, or groups supporting social causes, but to Asian American Christian groups. And I bet that if you walked down Sproul on a school day and grabbed every flier that was thrust into your hands, many of them would be invitations to Bible studies, prayer meetings, and other wholesome events hosted by Christian fellowships. I find it an ironic juxtaposition: here you have Sproul Plaza, the holy land of the Free Speech Movement and the birthplace of progressive student activism, and then you have a bunch of conservative Asian American Christian groups trying to invite you to their free BBQs. I don\u2019t speak about these Christian groups disrespectfully because, well, I\u2019m on staff with one. But I am heartbroken because, in spite of our hopes to proclaim Truth, when it comes to issues that matter to the rest of the campus and the world\u2014issues like politics, race, and justice\u2014the Asian American Christian community has, as Martin Luther King said of the Christian church, \u201clagged in its concern for social justice and too often has been content to mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities.\u201d And in a world where the status quo continues to pull the marginalized into even greater depths of poverty and hopelessness, silence is compliance, and it is hurtful. I believe the reason Asian American Christians are not more socially engaged is because we have internalized and co-opted the model minority myth into our theology. We have become the Moral Model Minority, silencing our distinct historical narratives and using God to validate our privilege. Majority culture has told us that we have succeeded without any handouts, and we have responded with a resounding \u201cAmen!\u201d without realizing that our alliance with the dominant culture has forfeited our identity and implicitly cast an indictment on other minority groups. Many Asian American Christians, finding that their Confucian values of hard work, personal achievement, and frugality aligned with the Protestant work ethic, have in fact replaced the Gospel with the American Dream. We have interpreted our signs of material and academic prosperity as God\u2019s blessing and have turned a pharisaic eye toward Black and Latino communities, LGBTQ communities, the poor, and the less privileged while forgetting that we were once in their shoes (and in many ways still are). Our theology furthers this downward spiral into social oblivion. Church historian Tim Tseng calls it the \u201cEvangelical deconstruction of Asian America\u201d where the belief is that \u201cour earthly identities ultimately do not matter [because] our Christian identity is our most important one.\u201d Is it a surprise, then, that Asian American Christians are quick to dismiss their own cultural identity? Perhaps in our pursuit to, as the Bible says, \u201cbe one in Christ,\u201d we have actually silenced our own unique stories and become cookie cutter Christians who no longer know themselves or their place in the world. Furthermore, the common Christian belief that this world is evil and passing away and that we should only be focused on some heaven in the hereafter only drives us to be more complacent toward a hurting world. As a community, we have forgotten about our marginalized past. We have forgotten that the reason many of our ethnic churches were built was because white churches would not accept us. Our churches therefore became ethnic community centers where we could receive language training, develop job networks, and obtain positions of leadership. However, instead of continuing to identify as marginalized and expressing our faith in a way that promoted justice (like many Black and Latino churches have), we clung to our upward mobility, adopted a white Western theology, moved to the suburbs, called it God\u2019s blessing, and began to view the world from a distance, through a privileged lens. We must remember that the Bible was written for marginalized communities in diaspora, not for privileged folks whose greatest fear in life is failing chem. We cannot forget that Jesus was a poor refugee, that he represented a Jewish people who were oppressed by Roman imperialists, and that he led a revolution called The Way that stood in stark opposition to the status quo. But we don\u2019t want to believe this, because to believe in this Jesus threatens our hard-earned success. So we nail him to a cross and we crucify our own identities and narratives along with him. To be frank, I strongly believe that issues of racial, sexual, political, social, and economic injustice have spiritual roots and solutions. The Christian community hopes to be a spiritual voice in the conversation on campus about justice. In light of all this, I apologize. I am sorry for my own silence, ignorance, and apathy, for the ways that the Christian community at Cal has been a purveyor of injustice rather than a co-laborer for peace. I apologize for the ways we have judged justice movements and have looked pridefully upon the activist community. The Asian American Christian community must reclaim its identity. We must refuse to adopt the story that American society gives us and instead tell our own distinct God-given narratives. We must see the world with new eyes and call out the ways that the dominant culture continues to prevent us from having the world that God desires: a world where there is no more violence or oppression, where relationships are made right, and where we can become whole again. We must realize that the Gospel is not just about converting individual souls for some paradise over yonder, but that it is about the restoration of all brokenness in the here and now. When we finally end our finger-pointing, we may find that we are just as much in need of conversion and salvation as those we have called \u201clost.\u201d When we join each other, we will find that our liberation and restoration are wrapped up together as one.

The artist more popularly known as Clara C has seen a meteoric rise in her public profile: from winning competitions and garnering millions of views on YouTube, her mesmerizing voice has captured the hearts of a wide fanbase. Her surprise performance at the 2012 Kollaboration San Francisco on September 8 brought full circle the path that her career as an independent musician has followed since she won Kollaboration 10 two years ago. Since its inception in 2000, Kollaboration has reflected the changing face of entertainment as more Asian Pacific Islander Americans like Clara C gain popularity and break into the industry that continues to exclude them. Although Kollaboration in its current state encompasses shows held in 14 cities across the United States, the very first show in Los Angeles on August 2000 focused more on generating interest in Korean American talent. Founder and longtime host Paul \u201cPK\u201d Kim saw a need for recognizing the people who shared his background but not the spotlight in mainstream media. As a talent showcase and organization, Kollaboration aims to provide \u201cEmpowerment through Entertainment,\u201d and the 3-year-old SF show brings together Asian American musicians, dancers, and comedians from the Bay Area as well as outside of it for a night of celebration. At the third Kollaboration San Francisco held on September 8 this year, the crowd that filled Zellerbach Hall no longer questioned if Asian Pacific Americans would remain invisible in entertainment. Established names like Jeremy Passion and Joseph Vincent headlined as guest judge and guest performer, respectively, while up-and-coming acts like Monsters Calling Home and UC Berkeley\u2019s own SoulFull competed for the $1000 prize. However, attending Kollaboration does not mean simply being an observer. Following its goal to inspire individuals to pursue their creative interests, the event also includes a freestyle vocal and dance portion in which audience members can take the stage to show off their skills to win a $100 prize. In this way, Kollaboration encourages attendees to participate in the experience in order to bring artists and viewers closer together. This year\u2019s winners of Kollaboration SF include $1000 grand prize winner Peter Chung and audience choice winner SoulFull, who took home $500. On being invited to judge, Passion observed, \u201cI think it\u2019s cool because it shows that they trust me somehow in my critique. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a part of Kollaboration somehow, so to be invited as a guest judge, it seems really like a great opportunity.\u201d Now held at Zellerbach Hall at UC Berkeley for the past two years, Kollaboration SF has a staff of 20 volunteers who put in months of planning between early spring 2012 and fall 2012, managed by executive director and Cal alum Christine Minji Chang. The sense of community that Kollaboration SF promotes operates in many ways: volunteers, performers, and attendees back each other up in their common purpose to cultivate talent. Chang sums up the close-knit relationship of the staff in a quote taken from one of the members: \u201cThe staff becomes a family, and it\u2019s all people that you never thought you\u2019d meet, that you\u2019d never thought you\u2019d spend that much time with.\u201d By completing community service once a month, the staff gains a better understanding of the people who make up the local area. Chang added, \u201cPerformers become a part of our family too: we are all supporting each other so they see all the hard work that goes into it, and they appreciate that, and we appreciate their talent. We want to see it grow because it\u2019s representing us, and so it becomes this community. Everyone who attends the show becomes a part of the family.\u201d From the attendee standpoint, the best part about Kollaboration SF is the close interaction new and old fans can have with the performers. Before the show, all the judges, competitors, and performers hung out on the second floor of Zellerbach, and during that time **hardboiled** took our fair share of photos with the ever dashing Joseph Vincent. When last year\u2019s Kollaboration SF winners, the 4-man singing group named ANAK, graced the stage with their smooth vocals and charisma, our publicity director Kassie swooned when a member took her hand as he sang to her. In the 12 years that have passed since Kollaboration began, the presence of Asian Americans in the entertainment industry has grown tremendously with much credit to the online community, the new frontline in vying for fame, publicity, and recognition. In an age of where \u201cvirality\u201d and \u201cblowing up\u201d have become more synonymous with YouTube success than biology exams, it\u2019s no wonder that rising Asian American artists have turned to the Internet \u2013 our perennial outlet of exchange \u2013 to express and share their talent. The guest judge for Kollaboration SF, Jeremy Passion \u2013 popularly known as just \u201cPassion\u201d \u2013 is undoubtedly one of the first Asian American Youtube artists to embrace the video site as a means of accruing widespread recognition. Passion noted that his first video \u201cLemonade\u201d became viral online and helped \u201cto start the acoustic movement of artists on the Internet.\u201d He was accompanied by a slew of up-and-coming artists, including folk pop darling Clara C and the effervescently dreamy Joseph Vincent. Although unsigned, these YouTube sensations have played a vital role in encouraging young musicians and artists to embrace social media as the status quo. They tour constantly. They tweet pics on the road. They update their v-blogs and chic websites. But perhaps most importantly, they remind us of their courage and unyielding passion to pursue their artistic dreams, and show us how much fun they can have in the process. One of the competitors, singer Dustin Ako, notes that \u201ceven though [my songs have] really cool rhythms and a lot of soul in them, [I try to] reach out to people\u2019s emotions, so we try to reach out to a very broad demographic. We do that through YouTube, Facebook, things like that.\u201d Kollaboration SF succeeds not only on the virtue of its meaningful message to the Asian American community, but also on its openness and accessibility to the most impressionable members of our community \u2013 teenagers and young adults. The snark ebullience and tongue-in-cheek charm of host Paul \u201cPK\u201d Kim perhaps best encapsulates the tone of Kollaboration SF: that yes, it\u2019s a significant performance arts event that showcases the best and brightest up-and-coming talents from around the state. But don\u2019t get it twisted: this is as much a celebration and night on the town as it is a time for honorifics.\u00a0 Hilarious banter, arena-concert cadences, and a strong sense of community pride dominate the vibe of Kollaboration SF. It\u2019s a place where we come to not only support members of the community trying to make it, but also to unite under a larger consciousness of artistic representation. Unlike a summer music festival or MTV awards show, material indulgence and celebrity boorishness are replaced by an unwavering sense of determination. To these artists, even if a record deal or nation-wide tour isn\u2019t on the immediate horizon, their very existence is remarkable. Clara C mentioned in an online interview with The Other Asians that \u201cI believe that independent artists are going to have a lot of things going for them. My dream is to sell out the Staples Center. I think it\u2019s possible without a label.\u201d As the YouTube view counts and retweets continue to increase, so does our confidence in this new generation of conscious, meaningful artists. To us, they\u2019ve already found success. \u00a0\n\n\n","html":"by christian ting and sam lai\r\n\r\nAs soon as the curtain lifted to reveal Clara Chung onstage at Zellerbach Hall, the crowd went wild with cheers.

Prop. 30 raises the income tax on those making more than $250,000 per year and raises the state sales tax by 0.25%, and the funds all go to education. While K-12 education and community colleges face the most cuts if Prop. 30 does not pass, the University of California faces a $250.0 million cut as well, no small number given the many cuts in the past few years. There is also a competing proposition to raise taxes for education, Prop. 38. It is expected to raise more money for education than Prop. 30 will because it increases taxes on those making over $7,316. However, none of that money will go to community colleges or public universities, so the UC would still face a $250.0 million cut. What\u2019s worse, if Prop. 38 passes, voters would be less likely to agree to a tax increase for community colleges or public universities in a future election. After all, voters do not want to raise taxes on themselves two elections in a row. The consequences are dire if Prop. 30 does not pass. Course offerings may be cut. Students will not be able to enroll in required classes or electives that they want to take, and while some people may say that electives are not important, having a specialized field of knowledge can be the difference between a job and unemployment in this tough economy. It can be the difference between staying an extra semester and graduating early to save money. It can be the difference between fulfilling all the requirements for a double major or an honors program. But Prop. 30 matters for API students in particular. In 2010, APIs comprised 13% of California\u2019s population, but comprised 39% of UC Berkeley\u2019s undergraduate student population. Similar stories hold true at other UC schools such as UCLA and UC Irvine. Looking around UC Berkeley, one probably figured out that APIs are overrepresented on campus, but 62% of API students in California are also enrolled in community colleges. Yes, that\u2019s right, a majority of API students in California do not directly enroll in four-year universities. We are much more complex than the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth ascribed to us. That generalization unfairly ignores those who do not fit the stereotype. Many APIs attend community colleges because they want to save money, because they want to be closer to home, because they are new immigrants, or simply because they screwed up in high school. Tina Savong \u201913, a Geography major in the Berkeley Cambodian Students Association, says, \u201cPeople whom I know from my hometown\u2014Long Beach, CA\u00ad\u2014[which has] a very high concentration of Cambodians, usually want to go to a city college first to save money or because they have that desire to help their parents financially. This means that instead of working towards a degree, they would rather work to form a source of income along with their parents.\u201d In addition, many community college students are recent immigrants. I personally know many hardworking students from Hong Kong who study at community colleges and transfer to UCs. They are not citizens yet and cannot vote, but they want to remain in this country and become productive citizens. Compared to other ethnic groups, Asian Americans do not possess as much social and political capital, partly because the United States heavily restricted their immigration before the Immigration and Naturalization Act in 1965. Education, therefore, is essential for them to succeed in our society. When API college students mobilize the API community, they can influence whether Prop. 30 passes. They can inform their parents and relatives about Prop. 30 and encourage them to vote. They can use their language skills to volunteer at community organizations and inform non-English speakers about Prop. 30 and the importance of voting. Lastly, they can band together and vote in a bloc. Even if they are unsuccessful, their actions will show politicians that they need to respect the interests of APIs and college students. APIs and college students are two often-ignored groups in the political process partly because of their lack of voting in comparison to other groups. Voting will empower the API community to become more influential in politics, because it will tell politicians that APIs do vote and that politicians can gain many votes if they help a group that the American political process has largely ignored. On Election Day, support Prop. 30 and vote against Prop. 38, in hope of preventing further cuts to community colleges and public universities but also in hope of advancing API goals in American politics. We CAN change our future. We CAN change this country. \u00a0\n\n<div><\/div>\n","html":"by donald chan\r\n\r\nStudents have a chance this November to show Sacramento that they will not stand for any further cuts to public education by voting in favor of Prop. 30.\r\n\r\nProp. 30 raises the income tax on those making more than $250,000 per year and raises the state sales tax by 0.25%, and the funds all go to education. While K-12 education and community colleges face the most cuts if Prop. 30 does not pass, the University of California faces a $250.0 million cut as well, no small number given the many cuts in the past few years.\r\n\r\nThere is also a competing proposition to raise taxes for education, Prop. 38. It is expected to raise more money for education than Prop. 30 will because it increases taxes on those making over $7,316. However, none of that money will go to community colleges or public universities, so the UC would still face a $250.0 million cut. What\u2019s worse, if Prop. 38 passes, voters would be less likely to agree to a tax increase for community colleges or public universities in a future election. After all, voters do not want to raise taxes on themselves two elections in a row.\r\n\r\nThe consequences are dire if Prop. 30 does not pass. Course offerings may be cut. Students will not be able to enroll in required classes or electives that they want to take, and while some people may say that electives are not important, having a specialized field of knowledge can be the difference between a job and unemployment in this tough economy. It can be the difference between staying an extra semester and graduating early to save money. It can be the difference between fulfilling all the requirements for a double major or an honors program.\r\n\r\nBut Prop. 30 matters for API students in particular. In 2010, APIs comprised 13% of California\u2019s population, but comprised 39% of UC Berkeley\u2019s undergraduate student population. Similar stories hold true at other UC schools such as UCLA and UC Irvine. Looking around UC Berkeley, one probably figured out that APIs are overrepresented on campus, but 62% of API students in California are also enrolled in community colleges.\r\n\r\nYes, that\u2019s right, a majority of API students in California do not directly enroll in four-year universities. We are much more complex than the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth ascribed to us. That generalization unfairly ignores those who do not fit the stereotype. Many APIs attend community colleges because they want to save money, because they want to be closer to home, because they are new immigrants, or simply because they screwed up in high school.\r\n\r\nTina Savong \u201913, a Geography major in the Berkeley Cambodian Students Association, says, \u201cPeople whom I know from my hometown\u2014Long Beach, CA\u00ad\u2014[which has] a very high concentration of Cambodians, usually want to go to a city college first to save money or because they have that desire to help their parents financially.

Whether Aoki was really an informant and to what extent, I don\u2019t know. But, what I do know is how callously Rosenfeld sensationalized something so impactful not only to those who knew and respected Aoki, but to the Asian American community. To Rosenfeld, perhaps, it is media fodder, but to so many others, it means a lot more \u2013 and that is something Rosenfeld was clearly aware of and manipulated. Why else would he choose to make a documentary of Richard Aoki \u2013 and drop the bombshell without sufficient evidence \u2013 just days before his book was published? To treat such a revelation with such little respect is not just disrespectful of Aoki, but of the entire API community. As a student journalist and former member of a constitutional team, I believe strongly in the press\u2019s responsibility for revealing the truth and would defend, had someone found comprehensive, solid evidence of Aoki\u2019s involvement with the FBI, his right \u2013 his responsibility, even \u2013 to publish it. It is even understandable, given that Aoki is not the focus of his book, that Rosenfeld cannot give a comprehensive image of the truth surrounding Aoki\u2019s involvement with the FBI. But, he purposely chose to stir up controversy with only a partial understanding, making it seem like Aoki is a much larger part of his book than he is. And honestly? I think that demonstrates a complete lack of empathy and respect to the community he purposely targeted for a little extra publicity. An Asian American Studies professor at UC Berkeley and close friend of Aoki, Harvey Dong pointed out that \u201cRosenfeld should have asked people who knew Richard.\u201d Truth is, Rosenfeld had never even met Aoki in person and only talked to him in two phone conversations in 2007. Those who *did *know Aoki met the news with disbelief and outrage. Diane Fujino, who published Aoki\u2019s biography, *Samurai Among Panthers*, earlier this year, was among the first to respond, pointing out that Rosenfeld relies on unconvincing evidence and provides neither motives nor conclusive evidence. Fred Ho, who worked with Aoki during the 90s, also spoke out in defense of Aoki. \u201cIf Richard was a FBI agent, how did he help the FBI? By training the Panthers in Marxist ideology, socialism? By leading drill classes at 7 a.m. daily and instilling iron discipline in their ranks? By being one of the leaders to bring about Ethnic (Third World) Studies in the U.S.?\u201d Fred challenged. To a community often stereotyped as compliant and passive, Aoki is representative of what Asian Americans are capable of. Aoki\u2019s legacy lives on, in the Ethnic Studies department here, in this paper, even, and nothing should detract from what he has done for this campus and for both the Asian American movement and the African American movement \u2013 especially when there is no conclusive evidence he helped to sabotage either. The impact of his activism is clear, the impact of his alleged informant identity much less clear and regardless of the truth, what he fought for \u2013 solidarity and understanding between minorities, for one \u2013 remains important. Ultimately, we must remember, as Dong said so aptly during his meeting with interns in APASD\u00a0 (Asian Pacific American Student Development) on September 25, that \u201cstories like this shouldn\u2019t discourage us from making social changes.\u201d Yes, I think the evidence is inconclusive at best, yet in the end, no matter what Aoki may have chosen to do in the past, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that what he stood for \u2013 and what I still believe he truly believed in \u2013 is still worth striving for. As Newton once told Aoki, \u201cthe struggle for freedom, justice, and equality transcends racial and ethnic barriers.\u201d That struggle is universal, and it continues to this day. If anything, Rosenfeld\u2019s insensitive actions towards the API community only prove that.\n\n- - - - - -\n\n by janice wong As Berkeley students, it is our responsibility to find the truth \u2013 no matter how difficult it is for us to acknowledge. This means that the \"facts\" that Seth Rosenfeld presents in his book *Subversives* are not going to be accepted without a thorough investigation and analysis from community members. Rosenfeld's claims rest primarily on the testimony of deceased FBI agent \u00a0Burney Threadgill, heavily redacted FBI documents on Richard Aoki, and M. Wesley Swearingen, a former FBI agent. A portion of the conversation Rosenfeld has with Threadgill is available online, and we are only able to hear what we are told is Threadgill's voice, saying \"Oh yeah, he was a character. He said 'I don't have any interest in communism,' and I said, 'Well why don't you just go to some of the meetings and tell me who's there and what they talked about?'\" We have no way of knowing whether or not it is actually Threadgill speaking, and the context of the conversation is only provided by Rosenfeld. Additionally, Rosenfeld claims that Threadgill brought up Aoki after seeing his name on an FBI document in 2002; however, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) states that it does not disclose any information about any person in their records, unless that person is already deceased. Aoki passed away on March 15, 2009 \u2013 which means that Aoki's name should not have been included in the FBI document that Rosenfeld claimed he possessed. Redacted information in the released FBI files on Aoki clearly demonstrates the type of censorship and level of privacy provided for people that are still living. While we are still on the subject of the FOIA and redacted information, I would like to point out that because of the heavy censorship throughout Aoki's FBI file, we are unable to conclude what kind of information Aoki supposedly furnished, and who was actually involved. Because of this, it's hard to say whether Aoki was actually an informant \u2013 or being informed on. There are inconsistencies throughout the FBI file that make it appear as if Aoki were being informed on, rather than being the informant. For example, on page 53 of the FBI file, it states that Aoki is of \"Korean\" descent, incorrectly listing his ethnicity. A second example is on page 242, or AOKI-246, dated December 29, 1972. Rosenfeld states that on this particular report, Aoki is reminded to report his income from the FBI on his tax return in a hand-written notation, which is not actually present on the document. Along with the incorrect references throughout the document, Rosenfeld constructs data that never really existed. During his short interview with Aoki, he claims that Aoki stated, \u201cPeople change. It is complex, layer upon layer,\u201d in response to Rosenfeld\u2019s question about whether or not he was an FBI informant. Upon listening to the actual recording, one finds that what Aoki may have been referring to is ambiguous. Although Rosenfeld claims that the words were in the exchange immediately before the others, the transcript of the conversation never has Aoki saying that at all, despite Rosenfeld\u2019s claims. Instead, listening to the recorded conversation gives it different context than what his book makes it out to be. It is clear that Rosenfeld is at least somewhat guilty of manipulating his findings in order for them to resonate with his arguments. Rosenfeld\u2019s self-proclaimed evidence has too many cracks for it to be considered admissible. Twisting the information on Aoki only serves to increase the sales for his book, *Subversives* \u2013 which, admittedly, piqued the interest of many students and community members alike. It is unfair for Aoki\u2019s legacy to be damaged in such a way, and Rosenfeld\u2019s information is barely circumstantial evidence at best. While Rosenfeld\u2019s research may have come to the conclusion that Aoki worked as an FBI informant, it is inconclusive in determining whether or not this had an impact on the most important aspects of Richard Aoki\u2019s legacy. The 1960s was a period where the government was obsessively suspicious of any and all \u201cradical\u201d groups, and considering that FBI agent Burney Threadgill claimed that he first found out about Aoki via wiretap, it is very possible that Aoki was being monitored long before he supposedly became an informant. Today, the notion of being an FBI informant may seem absurd, but back in the sixties, it was likely that it did not bear the same weight. Aoki\u2019s legacy should continue to live on, despite the negative media surrounding the allegations brought up in *Subversives*. - - - - - -\n\n by jenny lu No one knows. No one knows, for sure, if Richard Aoki was a FBI informant. So how do we come up with a conclusion as to whether or not to believe Seth Rosenfeld\u2019s claims? Our Asian Pacific Islander American community is torn. There are avid believers who defend Aoki\u2019s image; there are believers who completely disagree with and refuse to understand Rosenfeld\u2019s claims. Bobby Seale, one of the Black Panther Party\u2019s founding fathers, wholeheartedly believes in Aoki\u2019s innocence. Seale stated, \u201cThis\u2026 is about a defamation of my old colleague\u2026 Richard Aoki being a so-called snitch? Bullshit.\u201d Then there are those who are disappointed, confused, and lost\u2014who is this man we had once deemed an honorable figure who stood for justice? Aoki became the icon of API activism at Berkeley\u2014his image screamed \u201cThird World Liberation\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther Party.\u201d Aoki was an educator; his dedication to supporting diversity helped land Ethnic Studies classes on this very university. We cannot let go of a hero who has defined and strengthened the activism in the Asian American community. We cannot let incoherent claims damage the work Aoki has done for social justice and equality. We, as a community, will not allow a simple story to take away the legacy, history, and pride of the Asian American identity that Aoki helped to create. This controversy has riled a lot of attention, but we can take power in that. We can use this to shine light on the good that Aoki has done, all the contributions he made for our community, especially on the UC Berkeley campus. In an interview I conducted with Harvey Dong, professor of Asian American Studies at UC Berkeley, he shared his personal experiences and memories of Aoki, his longtime friend since they met in their undergraduate days at Cal. Dong said, \u201cIf Richard Aoki was an informant, [the FBI] did a lousy job. Richard did exactly the opposite [of what the FBI wanted]. Richard brought unity. He didn\u2019t do things that would sabotage the university, but it changed the institution of the university for the better\u2026With Richard\u2019s involvement, he bridged solidarity between Asians and Blacks.\u201d Aoki walked through the same paths we are walking today, he fought for some of the classes we have here today, he fought for education, opportunity, and understanding. He brought attention to the Asian Pacific Islander community; he showed society that we are not just the \u201cmodel minority.\u201d He showed everyone that we have a voice and that we must be heard. Most importantly, he fought for us\u2014the future. Aoki was an activist who wanted a better society, a more inclusive community; he wanted a positive change. Dong shared, \u201cRichard\u2019s motivation was to inspire others to continue the struggle\u2026 Coming together as a community, people being involved and using knowledge and using it for the community. Revolution of the mind.\u201d After so many years of his continued fight for us, how can we turn our backs on him now? We may never know if Richard Aoki was truly a FBI informant, but his actions in history never betrayed us. Throughout history, the API community has faced racism in the eye: we have been oppressed, we have been worked, stripped and exploited, and yet we have remained quietly resilient. Aoki may have been only one of few who have gained attention as an API American leader, but we will not be silenced anymore. As an Asian Pacific Islander American community, we must stand by Aoki\u2019s history and image. We will not let anyone take Richard Aoki away from us.\n","html":"by katherine wang\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s much to say about Seth Rosenfeld\u2019s new book, I\u2019m sure, but so far, all I\u2019ve heard is about ten pages of it.

(Why was F.A.M.E. started? What does F.A.M.E. stand for?)** F.A.M.E. is an acronym that stands for: fashion, art, music, exhibition. The way we see things is that we\u2019d rather have people from the community doing things for the community as opposed to people outside of it such as well....business folks. **Who or what is \u201cthe community\u201d?** The people: you, us, them, we, him, her, etc. **Why is it important for the community to do events like F.A.M.E. instead of business folks?** It is important because we know what is missing and what is needed so whatever we produce will be more genuine and of course more welcomed. **How long is the planning and implementation process? How much time is devoted to F.A.M.E.?** Since the inception of the first F.A.M.E., March 2010, the planning process has extended from 3 months out to at least 6 months out. It might not sound realistic but we are planning around the clock always searching for new ideas and building with veterans in the scene. **What\u2019s the poison of choice for those late nights working on F.A.M.E.? Coffee? Energy drinks? Water? Food? Food? More food? Bacon?** Ha, good question. We\u2019ve tried all of the above and so far it seems that mixture of 5-Hour Energy and coffee work best. Next up is probably 5-Hour Energy and Vietnamese coffee. **Where did the the theme \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d come from?** It came from one of the women\u2019s fashion magazines in a bookstore we happened to stop by. **I noticed that there were a lot of APIs (Asian\/Pacific Islanders) attending F.A.M.E.. Was this expected?** Yes, because we\u2019re the Bay Area and San Jose has one of the largest Vietnamese populations. Secondly, because we\u2019re heavily involved in the street dance community as well. **Were APIs specifically in mind when creating the event?** No, because we knew the API community would come out to support. **What do you think the large API turn-out says about the API community in the Bay Area?** It seems that the API community likes to stick together and support one another. **When people leave, what should they be walking out with?** A smile and inspiration. **Where would you like to see the community and F.A.M.E. be 10 years from now?** In 10 years time, we would like to wake up to a community of people doing what they love. Hopefully by then, F.A.M.E. would be a destination for aspiring as well as seasoned creatives. **What can people expect for the next F.A.M.E.?** You can always expect us to reinvent ourselves somehow someway.\n\n\n","html":"by kassie pham\r\n\r\n<strong>So\u2026 you\u2019re Bobbi Vie?<\/strong>\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who or what exactly are you?<\/strong>\r\nWe\u2019re a group of people that do what we love.\r\n\r\n<strong>And what is it that you love doing?<\/strong>\r\nAll things dance and all things fashion, more specifically in the hip hop\/street side of things.\r\n\r\n<strong>What\u2019s the purpose of F.A.M.E.?

Suffice it to say, Aoki was pretty iconic for the Asian American activist community. After all, not only was he an activist in the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), but also helped start the Black Panther Party. For me, Aoki was a hero. He stood with other great activists like Martin Luther King Jr., or Cesar Chavez Jr. He was a badass. Not only did he join the military to serve his country, fought for equality for people of color via Third World Liberation Front but he was also involved with the Black Panther Party. In August, when Seth Rosenfeld was getting ready to release his book, *Subversives: The FBI\u2019s War on Student Radicals, and Reagan\u2019s Rise to Power*, he released information that Aoki was an informant for the FBI. The Asian American community was confused. I know I was. News sources at the time were only reporting the same information: Aoki was an FBI informant. Dismayed, I was hoping that his friends could give me insight whether or not this information was true. So I sought out Harvey Dong, a friend of Aoki. He was interviewed by Seth Rosenfeld and started his own research when he found about Rosenfeld\u2019s allegation. Harvey had only scratched the surface in finding out information about Aoki. I got to see a couple of pages of the papers that implied that Aoki was an informant. These pages were mostly redacted (thick lines that cover up information) and therefore a bit confusing to interpret. Without hard evidence that Aoki was an informant, I hoped that the allegations were false. A couple of months have passed since the allegations. The Asian American community, especially those who knew Richard, demanded more information and more information is becoming available. There are many files that have not been released to the public and are going through a process so that they can be made available, particularly after November 1st. The information that is currently out there tends to confirm Aoki as an informant. When more information becomes available, who knows how the story will change. Maybe he really was not an informant, or the information will reaffirm that he was. Let us assume he was one. What kind of informant was he? Was he one that truly believed that the movement that he was a part of truly malicious, or was something else going on? I will have a harder time believing the former, as he became, as described by a chapter in Diane Fujino\u2019s *Samurai Among Panther*, an \u201cadvocate for the students.\u201d \u00a0Regardless of his informant status, he taught critical social issues, provided academic counseling to marginalized students and leadership to his colleagues.

It's the way I leave the stress and burdens of daily life and escape into the depths of my own mind. When I first started breaking I thought it would make me look cool to other people, but everyone has that moment when they realize it has become something more real. As a Berkeley student, I bear the responsibility of helping push forward society's frontier. As a son I bear the responsibility of carrying on a legacy of intelligent and beautiful people, both inspiring and aspiring. As a human being I burden of living my life to the fullest, and I guess that's where breaking plays a key role. I certainly bring these responsibilities onto myself, and by no means am forced to play any of these roles. Yet, at the same time, I need something to go to when the stresses of the world become too much to handle, and that's when I turn to the dance. I know this seems really cheesy but it's literally that best friend I could turn to if I have to. It's also a way to better learn myself. When you challenge yourself and really become in touch with yourself you grow, because you learn about every little aspect of your body. And your mind--when you think creatively you look into the little nooks and alleys of your brain, and this is what breaking allows me to do. Lilly Sedaghat, Question 1: What does breaking mean to you? To me, b-boying is more than just a physical art form that expresses power, creativity, and finesse. While on a visual surface it embodies all of these aspects, it is a way of life that harbors love, pain, frustration, and soul. In transcending three different plains of movement, in being so close to the earth, the sky, and the middle ground, it is an avenue that enables you to share light, express darkness, and grow. B-boying is a force field that protects me from the external difficulties of this world and also the harbinger of love and community into my life. Question 2: What does Dwinelle Hall mean to you? Dwinelle Hall is my home. It is my safe haven. It is the only space where I can truly be me without worrying about all the external factors that plague my spirit outside of that space. When I walk through the glass doors and step onto that floor, feel the energy of the folks around me, and listen to the music, every problem, every source of pain that I have dissipates into thin air and I'm just able to move. It means the world to me because without that space, I wouldn't have been able to find my family and without my family, I wouldn't have been able to be the person I am today. Andy Hu, 3rd year What does breaking mean to you? To me breaking is two things. Breaking is a means for learning how to empower, understand, and express myself. Since I've started, I've found that gaining full ownership of your body and movement teaches you a lot about yourself and lets you carry a special confidence. Breaking is also about community and connecting with people. Almost anywhere I've gone at Cal, I've been asked to introduce myself with my major, year, and a few fun facts about myself. With breaking, it's been pretty different for me. I get a sense of who someone is just from watching them dance, and others get to know me by watching me, too. Given all the accolades to accredit to breaking, community and the people I've met through the dance is are without a doubt two of the main reasons why I enjoy it so much and want to continue with it. What does Dwinelle Hall mean to you? Dwinelle Hall has been where almost all the magic happens. It's a laboratory for creating and expressing ideas and a hot spot for having a good time. As a student who's had classes and meetings in Dwinelle for three of the last four semesters, spending time dancing and practicing in Dwinelle at night makes Dwinelle more than what many people may think of it as. It can be a little grungy sometimes on the weekends in Dwinelle, but surely I've felt a little less than myself by not practicing in there. Dylan Tong 3rd year What does breaking mean to you? When I was first learning how to break dance, I always thought it was just a spectacle. It always seemed like a dance based on how many tricks you could do. However, as I began to learn more about the history, culture, and dance, my thoughts rapidly changed. Breaking has become a lifestyle to me. It isn't just a dance, but it is a culture. Breaking means community. It represents all the people out there that are connected by this thread of destiny. It acts as a universal language that helps us communicate our emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Breaking means respect. It represents our ability to overcome adversity in the circles. It shows the respect we have for each other when we throw ourselves out there in the circles, leaving ourselves out there as vulnerable yet proving ourselves stronger than that. Breaking means education. We are never teachers but students of the art. We always strive to learn from our elders about the community and history then share it with everyone else. We grow day by day with knowledge and develop ourselves for others to learn from. Arthur Savangsy I dance because it\u2019s fun and I specifically break because it challenges me holistically! Physical, mental and spiritual character! It\u2019s the way I tell my story and stories through movement without words. I respond stories to the way the music tells its story to me so I also become a channel for music. I dance because it is freedom and physical freedom at its finest! Nobody can tell me how to move or judge my movements. I move as I please and as I feel! \u00a0\n","html":"<em>Some b-boys (and girls) educated us on the merits of break dancing and their use of Dwinelle Hall.<\/em>\r\n\r\nRahul Doraiswami, 2nd year\r\n\r\nBreaking is my escape.

Breaking has become a lifestyle to me. It isn't just a dance, but it is a culture.\r\n\r\nBreaking means community. It represents all the people out there that are connected by this thread of destiny. It acts as a universal language that helps us communicate our emotions, thoughts, and feelings.\r\n\r\nBreaking means respect. It represents our ability to overcome adversity in the circles. It shows the respect we have for each other when we throw ourselves out there in the circles, leaving ourselves out there as vulnerable yet proving ourselves stronger than that.\r\n\r\nBreaking means education. We are never teachers but students of the art. We always strive to learn from our elders about the community and history then share it with everyone else. We grow day by day with knowledge and develop ourselves for others to learn from.\r\n\r\nArthur Savangsy\r\n\r\nI dance because it\u2019s fun and I specifically break because it challenges me holistically! Physical, mental and spiritual character! It\u2019s the way I tell my story and stories through movement without words. I respond stories to the way the music tells its story to me so I also become a channel for music. I dance because it is freedom and physical freedom at its finest! Nobody can tell me how to move or judge my movements. I move as I please and as I feel!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":27,"created_at":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 17:08:29 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 17:12:20 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":2629,"title":"issue 16.2","slug":"issue-16-2","markdown":"\n![](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/16.2.jpg)[Download the pdf](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/16.2.pdf) or read it online: - [Telling My Story](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/tel\/ \"Telling My Story: adopting asian\") by jason huynh | layout by katherine wang\n- [YouTube Famous](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/youtube-famous\/ \"YouTube Famous\") & [Just Another Hollywood](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/just-another-hollywood\/ \"Just Another Hollywood\") by jenny lu & sam lai | layout by katherine wang\n- [Affirmative Action Case](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/speak-now-or-forever-hold-your-peace\/ \"Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace\") by nate lee | layout by janice wong\n- [MSD Directors](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/the-perks-pains-of-student-advocacy\/ \"The Perks & Pains of Student Advocacy\") by sam lai | layout by sam lai\n- [PAHC Org Spotlight](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/one-heart-one-beat\/ \"One Heart One Beat\") by pahc & jessie kong | layout by jessie kong\n- [The Racist Fashionista](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/the-racist-fashionista\/ \"The Racist Fashionista\") by stacey nguyen | layout by adelyn chan\n- [White-Washed](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/white-washed\/ \"White-Washed\") by alex lee | layout by janice wong\n- [Represen-Asia](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/reprensen-asia\/ \"Reprensen-Asia\") by christian ting | layout christine tran\n- [The Breaking Point](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/the-breaking-point\/ \"The Breaking Point\") by kassie pham | layout by christine tran\n- [A Sweet Confession](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/ASweet.jpg)\u00a0by adelyn chan | layout sam lai\n\n\n","html":"<img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/16.2.jpg\" width=\"503\" height=\"636\" \/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/16.2.pdf\">Download the pdf<\/a> or read it online:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"Telling My Story: adopting asian\" href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/tel\/\">Telling My Story<\/a> by jason huynh | layout by katherine wang<\/li>\r\n\t<li><a title=\"YouTube Famous\" href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/archived-issues\/issue-16-2\/youtube-famous\/\">YouTube Famous<\/a> &amp;

I accept the possibility of these amazing stories; however, I see the many ugly truths that exist behind layers of misleading media portrayals and perpetuate in the everyday lives of adoptees, many of whom who still cope with the underlying faults of today\u2019s adoption process. I must add this caveat before I continue: Every adoptee has their own experiences, whether positive or negative, and my personal experiences cannot dictate how another adoptee feels about the same situation. I share my story because there are underlying themes that affect us all. Adoption, in itself, is extremely complex and becomes even more so in transracial adoptions where parents, usually white, adopt a child of another ethnicity\/\"race.\" Between the Korean War in 1950 and up until today, there has been an extraordinary increase in transracial adoptions from Asia; hundreds of thousands of orphaned children from South Korea, Vietnam, China, and other Asian countries have been physically displaced among Western countries into the possession of white parents. The increase in orphans as a result of war-torn countries in Asia coincides with the seemingly philanthropic view of Western countries to adopt helpless children. A statistic that still surprises me is one that describes: 10% of Koreans residing in the United States are adoptees. In Berkeley, it is difficult to imagine that 1 out of every 10 Korean-identified student is an adoptee. In fact, it is unlikely to be true, at least in a place like Berkeley, because many adoptees are adopted into predominantly white communities in the Midwest. For the many transracial adoptees growing up in predominantly white communities, they lose the ability to learn and identify with their own ethnic backgrounds because their connection has been severed on two fronts: their adoptive family and their community are unable to properly prepare them for experiences of discrimination and prejudice as a person of color, even within the family unit or community itself. There are many cases where parents approach adoption as \u201ccolor-blind\u201d, where the adoptee\u2019s ethnicity is completely disregarded. It is unacceptable to pretend that ethnicity does not matter when adoptees will be judged by that very same factor for all their lives. Nearly every day, they will be confronted with Asian stereotypes that they will be unable to cope with in the white community. Within the Asian American community, Asian transracial adoptees often have difficulty \u201cfitting in\u201d because they did not grow up with the same cultural familiarity. Although I am physically Asian and can blend in, I had considered myself mentally \u201cwhite\u201d and acted as such. My connection to my own ethnic background was severed, and I was unable to fully fit in with neither the white community nor the Asian community because of the dichotomy between my physical side and my mental side. As a result, I personally went through a variety of identities, none of which fully represented who I was. I remember thinking in middle school that I considered myself white, while fellow schoolmates would consider me as Asian. I didn\u2019t know what Asian really meant, and so I naturally believed all of the stereotypes I heard because I didn\u2019t know the truth. For example, I became good at math just because other people inferred that about me. Once in high school, where there was a larger population of Asian American students, I didn\u2019t know how to fully connect with them because I still didn\u2019t know what \u201cAsian\u201d meant. I would think, \u201cI look like you, but I have no idea what you are.\u201d At that point in time, I was desperate to learn what \u201cAsian\u201d really meant and I wanted to be able to \u201cfit in.\u201d I took classes in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. I learned how to use chopsticks. I watched Asian dramas. I listened to K-pop. And over many years of learning what \u201cAsian\u201d meant and disentangling what I had initially believed, I was finally indistinguishable from any other Asian. Yet even though I got what I always wanted, to \u201cfit in,\u201d I found myself stumbling over residual issues as a product of my adoption. Although I did not initially consider my adoption as the source, there were recurring issues involving identity, abandonment, perfectionism, issues with my own adoptive family, and thoughts of my own birth family\u2026 Over the past two years I went through a \u201cbirth family search,\u201d which I would consider one of the most emotional times of my life. I was born in Hawai\u02bbi in 1990 and adopted by a Caucasian family at the age of 4. We then moved to Washington D.C. where I grew up in a community where I was the only Asian person up until high school, where it was slightly more diverse. After high school, I decided to move to sunny and diverse Los Angeles, California, where I attended various community colleges. Then, before I transferred to UC Berkeley, I went back to Hawai\u02bbi because I felt an intense internal pull for me to learn about the circumstances of my past. There is something special about knowing where you come from that is only intensified under circumstances where it is inaccessible or ambiguous. There are special experiences of being an adoptee, which I feel makes it an identity in itself. I am currently trying to define and empower the word \u201cadoptee\u201d; however, it is difficult when adoption has become a huge taboo in today\u2019s society. It is not talked about within friends, families, and communities, and all that is known are the Cinderella-like stories shared widely by the media. When all I wanted was to \u201cfit in,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t disclose my adoptee identity to my friends, and much less to myself. There was a stigma against it, but in retrospect, being an adoptee was influential in so many of my experiences. Currently, I am still in the process of connecting with other adoptees to share and learn from our experiences. It is extremely difficult to connect to other adoptees because of the stigma against it; however, I am hoping that by sharing my story, it will inspire other adoptees to do so. I am in the midst of starting a new organization at Berkeley named \u201cAdoptee University,\u201d which I am trying to get the word out about. I am also involved in a large theatrical production of Operation Babylift, which was the airlifting of thousands of Vietnamese orphans at the end of Vietnam War to the United States where they were adopted into white families. With all of these projects, I am pushing for the empowerment of adoptees to strengthen our own futures, to end the silence of our scattered community, and to shape the futures of younger adoptees.[]()\n\n\n","html":"by jason huynh\r\n\r\nThey call me an \"Angry Adoptee.\" It is because I speak out against the widely believed stereotype of a miraculous, happily-ever-after, and rags-to-riches story of a poor, ethnic orphan adopted by wealthy, white parents.

Even today, we are continuously misrepresented with stereotypes that neither voice nor represent us. Countless Asian characters in media don\u2019t even properly portray Asian Americans, but instead perpetuate the same stereotypes that degrade our community. Although Asian Americans are underrepresented in mass media, we have found a new source to showcase our talent: YouTube. Famous Asian Americans\u2014from singers and dancers to comedians and filmmakers\u2014are taking YouTube by storm. Even though YouTube doesn\u2019t guarantee a massive audience, that audience is important. With independent channels boasting millions of subscribers each, success would be an understatement. The YouTube community shines a spotlight on many Asian Americans who want to pursue entertainment as a career or just as a hobby, such as singer David Choi and comedians David So, Kevin Wu (KevJumba), and Ryan Higa. YouTube even allows already famous Asian Americans, like basketball player Jeremy Lin and artist Jay Park, to update their fans through a personal outlet. Through collaborating with each other, these YouTubers have created a tight-knit community of talented Asian American artists who aspire to make a difference through music, film, and acting as well as inspire others to pursue their dreams. Another famous YouTube group is Wong Fu Productions, a group of three Asian American men from California who write, film, edit, and produce their own shorts, series, and videos. Their videos range from love stories and humorous shorts to video logs of their lives. Wong Fu Productions often casts other Asian Americans in their videos, giving these artists an opportunity to display their talents as well as connect the Asian American Youtube community through their collaborative efforts. Although Wong Fu Productions has the talent and potential to address Asian American issues through their work in order to progress toward change, their presence is already enough to pave the way for and encourage other Asian Americans in media. The existence of famous YouTubers like Ryan Higa and Wong Fu Productions is vital to our community. They represent Asian Americans in a way that society isn\u2019t accustomed to seeing: as normal people with no stereotypical baggage to carry. Yes, some of Ryan Higa and WFP\u2019s humor is senseless and stupid, but they\u2019ve broken down barriers for Asian Americans. We don\u2019t have to always be represented in cultural or ethnic ways. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, WFP is the perfect example of Asian Americans who are straying from the stereotype of becoming doctors, lawyers, or engineers, and achieving their own dreams. The very presence of Asian Americans who are experiencing success in media and passionately doing what they enjoy is breaking down the model minority myth. After the history of oppression and silencing our people have endured, we are challenging the silence that once held us back in the past. We are able to pave our way into walks of life that often aren\u2019t welcoming to us. The best part is, you can look at Wong Fu Productions and enjoy their work simply for their work, not for whether or not they accurately portray Asian Americans.\n\n\n","html":"by jenny lu\r\n\r\nAsian Americans have often been misrepresented in popular culture, whether it be in TV, film, or music videos.

None of the videos I watched induced any sort of fangirling in me, and if any of my friends burst into adoration for Wong Fu, I could only look on passively. After avoiding the hype for years, I decided to give WF another chance at impressing me. \u201cThe Last\u201d opens to Kina Grannis (hapa singer\/songwriter) and Harry Shum Jr. (the only cute guy on *Glee*) lying blissfully in bed, the afternoon light making their flawless skin glow. After Shum whispers \u201cI love you\u201d to Grannis, she sits up and drops the question, \u201cHow many were there before me?\u201d Then Shum goes down the list of five questionably-named women: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. I won\u2019t spoil the ending, but the short predictably finishes on a happy (more like sappy) note. To be honest, I could not even watch the full video continuously. I had to stop once or twice and shake my head in confusion before exclaiming, \u201cSeriously, what the hell?!?\u201d The lengthy, scripted confession of love made my eyes roll. Everything in the short film, from the lighting to the female characters, looked airbrushed. However, what upset me the most about \u201cThe Last\u201d wasn\u2019t just the way it glamourizes and objectifies Asian Pacific American women because the rest of Wong Fu\u2019s work repeats the same old clich\u00e9s. The short confirmed why I\u2019ve felt so disappointed with Wong Fu\u2019s work: applauded for raising the profiles of APA entertainers, Wong Fu focuses too much on the young, privileged, and educated. Essentially, they flatter the well-off population of APAs who don\u2019t deserve any more attention in independent media like Wong Fu\u2019s than they already get in Hollywood. Yes, Wong Fu does get credit for their artistic talents, but their unoriginal pieces only reinforce the model minority stereotype that has limited APA representation in the first place. By emphasizing a predominantly upper-middle class, heterosexual, East Asian population, Wong Fu Productions lose out on the potential of their art to tell stories about struggle and conflict. Founded by Philip Wang, Wesley Chan, and Ted Fu, the independent production company now attracts an international fanbase spread across the United States and the rest of the globe. In addition to creating short films, videologs, and music videos, Wong Fu also co-founded a concert called ISA, or International Secret Agents, with pop\/hip-hop stars Far East Movement. Phil, Wes, and Ted also receive rock star treatment in their own right on their tours to universities, including UC Berkeley. Their online store sells a series of \u201cAwkward Animals\u201d toys that go for up to $45, and I\u2019ve seen several people who own an Awkward Panda keychain or Awkward Turtle plush. Wong Fu\u2019s popularity has turned into a phenomenon that mainstream media has taken note of: CNN interviewed them on television, and AT&T worked with them on a web series. What has their \u201csuccess\u201d amounted to, though? No doubt when Phil, Wes, and Ted first set out to produce their own videos in their undergrad days at UC San Diego, they wanted nothing more than to express their own views of life. They explored stereotypes, awkward situations, girl problems, guy problems, and girl-guy problems. I admit I haven\u2019t watched every single piece by Wong Fu, but I also argue that you need only see \u201cThe Last\u201d to know who their target audience is: heterosexual, most likely underage\/twenty-something hopeless romantics. As someone who previously fit into that category, I know how Wong Fu draws in its fans: through shiny-looking actors like Shum, cheeky humor, and a pro makeup and hair team. The videos that Wong Fu produce aren\u2019t groundbreaking or politically conscious, preferring to parody rather than directly critique misconceptions about Asian Americans. The videos that do attempt to present a more sensitive depiction of APAs do so only for a limited group: the straight couples who get together, frolic around, and then tragically break up. I can forgive Wong Fu for their absent political agenda: plenty of filmmakers in Hollywood who hope to make some sort of commentary about equality end up perpetuating problematic images of APIs (e.g. white savior movies). To be real, though, as much as I gag whenever I watch Phil and another recycled actress from other videos go through a doomed relationship yet again, I realize that my own biases color how I perceive Wong Fu\u2019s work. I grew up in San Gabriel Valley where Wong Fu keeps its offices, and I know too well the luxuries of suburban life for the US-born Asian Americans who live there. I\u2019m sick of seeing them. Their life, my own, belong to an exclusive group, and all that Wong Fu reflects is that existence, not what the APA community has struggled through and still does. Wong Fu functions the same way Hollywood does by featuring the people who have the privileges that everyone wants: education, economic status, and damned good looks, if not a girlfriend or boyfriend who has them too. In a blog post from November 5, Wong Fu commented on the amount of press that their latest video \u201cThe Last\u201d had received since its debut: \u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to have such an amazing fan base, and that technology can keep us all connected, and most of all, that people can still understand and be open towards content like ours.

None of the videos I watched induced any sort of fangirling in me, and if any of my friends burst into adoration for Wong Fu, I could only look on passively. After avoiding the hype for years, I decided to give WF another chance at impressing me. \u201cThe Last\u201d opens to Kina Grannis (hapa singer\/songwriter) and Harry Shum Jr. (the only cute guy on <em>Glee<\/em>) lying blissfully in bed, the afternoon light making their flawless skin glow. After Shum whispers \u201cI love you\u201d to Grannis, she sits up and drops the question, \u201cHow many were there before me?\u201d Then Shum goes down the list of five questionably-named women: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. I won\u2019t spoil the ending, but the short predictably finishes on a happy (more like sappy) note.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I could not even watch the full video continuously. I had to stop once or twice and shake my head in confusion before exclaiming, \u201cSeriously, what the hell?!?\u201d The lengthy, scripted confession of love made my eyes roll. Everything in the short film, from the lighting to the female characters, looked airbrushed. However, what upset me the most about \u201cThe Last\u201d wasn\u2019t just the way it glamourizes and objectifies Asian Pacific American women because the rest of Wong Fu\u2019s work repeats the same old clich\u00e9s.

She says, \u201cJust being in a network of UT graduates would have been a really nice thing to be in. And I probably would have gotten a better job offer had I gone to UT.\u201d She has called upon the Asian American community, a group often seen as a victim of affirmative action measures, to support her cause. \u00a0 To some, the white-Asian partnership to bring down affirmative action makes sense. Isn\u2019t affirmative action just \u201creverse racism?\u201d Didn\u2019t whites and Asians, after all, *earn* their way into the top universities? And if the proportion of Asians in the top colleges actually outpaces the proportion of Asians in society, don\u2019t Asians have something to lose if affirmative action is upheld? \u00a0 To answer the questions: no, not really, and no. \u00a0 My hope for this article, however, is not to break down the nuances of affirmative action, but to address the ugly underside of an iceberg of which affirmative action is just the tip. Racism has its grip on the very roots of this country and the Asian American community, if it refuses to buy into the dominant culture ethos, has the opportunity to reconfigure and challenge the racial landscape. \u00a0 Asian Americans find themselves in what some have called the \u201cracial middle.\u201d While black communities may readily identify as oppressed and white communities privileged, Asian Americans have some sorting out to do. Yes, we are oppressed; yes, we are also privileged. In many ways, the Asian American community finds itself floating around on a continuum between white and black, unsure of our own identity, of what we offer to the conversation, unsure even if the term \u201cAsian American\u201d really gives us extra capital as a social bloc if it actually ends up silencing the diversity contained within itself. And if we are unsure of our identity, unable to agree on what it is exactly that makes us who we are, then we are very susceptible to lies. Lies that, if not confronted, start to sound more and more like truth the longer they persist. \u00a0 And so we believe them. We believe Abigail Fisher when she says that we stand to benefit from the annulment of affirmative action. We believe dominant culture when they call us the model minority. We internalize the belief that we actually do work harder than other minorities, we do deserve more than those who are poor, and we\u2019ve earned our way here in a vacuum without any structural or external forces to push our sails. In the end we believe that we are worthless, because these lies are nothing more than colonizing compliments, fake praises that chain us down more than they uplift us. \u00a0 We may even believe other marginalized groups when they say that Asian Americans are just like them, that we can be included too in fighting for equality. And it seems like this is the route of choice for progressive Asian Americans, but what often ends up happening is that we simply latch onto a black or brown movement; either way, we still lose our voice. \u00a0 And what breaks my heart is that whether you\u2019re complicit in the American machine or not, whether you\u2019ve bought into the model minority myth or not, whether you\u2019ve sided with the white community or the black community, many of our stories have still been swept away under the tide of someone else\u2019s. And I believe this country will never see wholeness as long as the Asian American community does not know the power of its own voice. \u00a0 Mari Matsuda, in her famous speech \u201cWe Will Not Be Used,\u201d says, \u201c[The racial middle] can reinforce white supremacy if the middle deludes itself into thinking it can be just like white if it tries hard enough. Conversely, the middle can dismantle white supremacy if it refuses to be the middle, refuses to buy into racial hierarchy, if it refuses to abandon communities of black and brown people, choosing instead to form alliances with them.\u201d And Matsuda is right\u2014if we are to challenge racism in America, we cannot abandon other communities of color, but I think we can even transcend this dualistic way of thinking about minorities. \u00a0 The Asian American community does not exist on a continuum where one side is white and the other is black, and where we are forced to pick a side. If that is the case, whatever choice we make, we still end up having our voices trampled beneath the feet of someone else\u2019s march to power. Instead, the Asian American community must challenge the black-white binary itself and imagine a space where black, white, and Asian American (and other minority) communities each have an equal say in the conversation, a space where our stories are not just a footnote on someone else\u2019s agenda. \u00a0 But America will not give us this space. We must claim it for ourselves. We must first identify the lies that we have so readily consumed and begin to challenge even our own conceptions of who we are. We must be able to look at our history and determine our own names, our own identity, and our own voice. And when we have that foundation, when we understand who we were created to be, we will be able to move with courage to challenge the insufficient labels and structures that society has offered us. We will stop being puppets for other people\u2019s causes, mere commodities to be used and thrown away whenever convenient.

Chavez Center don\u2019t know what goes on there. The daily foot traffic that flows through the hallways rarely takes a moment to stop and read the signs on each door: Native American Advisory Council (NAAC), Chicano\/Latino Student Development (CLSD), African American Student Development (AASD), and Asian Pacific American Student Development (APASD). When I fill in office hours as an APASD intern, once in a while someone will wander in asking for directions to another part of the building, not bothering to ask what our section does. On a regular basis, APASD interns tend to see familiar faces from student organizations that relate to Asian Pacific Islander culture or identity. Not often do we get to know the interns in the other offices, except for a brief \u201chello\u201d when they come into pick up something from the printer. For the cohort of interns who organize events for APASD, the mission is clear: to serve the diverse and changing needs of the API community through programming that promotes cross-cultural relations and advocates for civil rights and social justice. Yet to the broader on-campus student population, for those who have never heard of APASD (pronounced ah-pahz-dee) or been involved in API groups, the offices mean little. As a current APASD intern, I hope to give an insider\u2019s account of the challenges and privileges that the position brings, at least for me. The history of APASD begins with the struggle in the 1990s for the establishment of programs that aimed to support ethnic minorities. In 1989, when API students made up 26% of the Berkeley campus, a report titled \u201cAsian Americans at Berkeley\u201d and compiled by a task force looked at changes in admissions policies over the past seven years and concluded that no long-term systematic bias had been shown towards APIs. The report looked at the impact of decisions in 1984 that halted the guaranteed admission of low-income students who had the academic qualifications, and while it hinted at the possibility of \u201canti-Asian\u201d policies, no concrete evidence for the deliberate exclusion of APIs could be found. Spurred on by the findings in this report, students pushed to have staff and resources at the administrative level that directly addressed API issues. Eventually, communities of color merged to form the Multicultural Action Team (MAT) including the Native American Advisory Council, Chican@\/Latin@ Agenda, African American Agenda, and the Asian Agenda. Towards the mid-1990s, each office remained focused on its respective community but added \u201cStudent Development\u201d to show solidarity and a shared purpose to support students who continued to be marginalized. By bridging the gap between the scholarly work done in Ethnic Studies and activism in the community, the MSD offices aim to recognize and fulfill the needs of minorities on-campus. Today, the MSD offices operate as an administrative unit, with directors overseeing students who provide staff support through internships. For APASD specifically, the major programs that interns plan are CAPAW (Celebration of APA Womyn) in the fall semester and APIICON (API Issues Conference) in the spring. Interns also can initiate their own projects or events, such as book signings, film screenings, panels, etc. In addition, interns act as liaisons to student orgs and on-campus agencies to work with students, faculty, and administrators on issues such as retention or career counseling. APASD\u2019s director, Jere Takahashi, has been a part of Berkeley for over 30 years, and for new interns like myself, his insight has proven instrumental in my own growth as a student and aspiring activist. With a background in Asian American Association, this APA newsmagazine, and Cal Queer & Asian, I entered APASD with the hope that I would be able to fuse together my experiences into a project or event that addressed the intersections of identity: gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity. What could be more appropriate for an Asian American Studies major than an internship in an office that shared the history of ethnic students\u2019 struggle to gain equity? What I\u2019ve realized this far along into my first semester in APASD is that I have much to learn about the dynamics of those identities and what role they play in API activism. First, the perks of being an APASD intern: I have found a new home in the office, where interns take care of logistical tasks but also study or hang out between classes. Now a 5th-year Psychology major, fellow intern Alyssa Ablao recalls attending APIICON while in her second year at De Anza Community College in Cupertino. Alyssa says, \u201cIt was a life changing event that influenced my decision to pick UC Berkeley.\u201d After being involved with the organization APA Student Leadership (APASL) at De Anza, she wanted to find out more about the planning team for APIICON and join a committee. Now Alyssa also sees the office as a second home: \u201cEveryone there is a representative from a different community, so I\u2019m constantly exposed to the events and interests of a variety of spaces. I also get to interact with everyone who comes in and out of the office, so I feel like I\u2019m always connected to the rest of the API community.\u201d The best part about being an intern for me is that it doesn\u2019t feel like work: besides the regular events like CAPAW and APIICON, interns have the freedom to come up with and implement any ideas for activities they want. From collaborating with interns and other students outside of MSD to help plan CAPAW (a semi-formal banquet which took place on November 18), we built a bond through our shared interest in illuminating the stories of womyn who have struggled in silence. I\u2019m proud of the small but strong team of womyn who put in hours late at night to make CAPAW happen, and it was inspiring to hear activists like Mia Nakano and Julia Rhee tell their stories. Ruby Lim, a 4th-year Anthropology major in her first year at APASD, summed it up best: \u201cThis year\u2019s cohort is actually smaller than in the previous years, creating a more intimate space. Each one of us all come from different groups and organizations that helped mold this unique cohort. This space helps build cultural awareness not only in just API and APAs, but also cross-culturally because APASD is one of the Multicultural Student Development offices.\u201d Let\u2019s be real though: events like CAPAW are a privilege to put on and attend. Not everything that happens in student advocacy work looks that glamorous, and it never should appear that way. Interns sit through weekly meetings that sometimes end past 10 pm, often after a long day of classes. For those who were involved in either CAPAW or APIICON, that meant additional meetings throughout the week. We have our disagreements, and we\u2019re not all best friends with each other or our neighbors in MSD. Few people outside of the space make use of the mental health services provided by API Connect, a counseling resource for students seeking support either in academics or personal life. Last-minute complications will often arise the day of events we plan, and we just do our best to deal with whom and what we\u2019ve got. And therein lies the beauty of APASD: we make the most of what we have because our predecessors did the same in order for us to have a foundation on which to build.\n\n\n","html":"by sam lai\r\n\r\nMore often than not, the people who pass by the Multicultural Student Development offices in the Cesar E.

Not often do we get to know the interns in the other offices, except for a brief \u201chello\u201d when they come into pick up something from the printer.\r\n\r\nFor the cohort of interns who organize events for APASD, the mission is clear: to serve the diverse and changing needs of the API community through programming that promotes cross-cultural relations and advocates for civil rights and social justice. Yet to the broader on-campus student population, for those who have never heard of APASD (pronounced ah-pahz-dee) or been involved in API groups, the offices mean little. As a current APASD intern, I hope to give an insider\u2019s account of the challenges and privileges that the position brings, at least for me.\r\n\r\nThe history of APASD begins with the struggle in the 1990s for the establishment of programs that aimed to support ethnic minorities. In 1989, when API students made up 26% of the Berkeley campus, a report titled \u201cAsian Americans at Berkeley\u201d and compiled by a task force looked at changes in admissions policies over the past seven years and concluded that no long-term systematic bias had been shown towards APIs. The report looked at the impact of decisions in 1984 that halted the guaranteed admission of low-income students who had the academic qualifications, and while it hinted at the possibility of \u201canti-Asian\u201d policies, no concrete evidence for the deliberate exclusion of APIs could be found.\r\n\r\nSpurred on by the findings in this report, students pushed to have staff and resources at the administrative level that directly addressed API issues. Eventually, communities of color merged to form the Multicultural Action Team (MAT) including the Native American Advisory Council, Chican@\/Latin@ Agenda, African American Agenda, and the Asian Agenda.\r\n\r\nTowards the mid-1990s, each office remained focused on its respective community but added \u201cStudent Development\u201d to show solidarity and a shared purpose to support students who continued to be marginalized. By bridging the gap between the scholarly work done in Ethnic Studies and activism in the community, the MSD offices aim to recognize and fulfill the needs of minorities on-campus.\r\n\r\nToday, the MSD offices operate as an administrative unit, with directors overseeing students who provide staff support through internships. For APASD specifically, the major programs that interns plan are CAPAW (Celebration of APA Womyn) in the fall semester and APIICON (API Issues Conference) in the spring. Interns also can initiate their own projects or events, such as book signings, film screenings, panels, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, interns act as liaisons to student orgs and on-campus agencies to work with students, faculty, and administrators on issues such as retention or career counseling. APASD\u2019s director, Jere Takahashi, has been a part of Berkeley for over 30 years, and for new interns like myself, his insight has proven instrumental in my own growth as a student and aspiring activist.\r\n\r\nWith a background in Asian American Association, this APA newsmagazine, and Cal Queer &amp; Asian, I entered APASD with the hope that I would be able to fuse together my experiences into a project or event that addressed the intersections of identity: gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity. What could be more appropriate for an Asian American Studies major than an internship in an office that shared the history of ethnic students\u2019 struggle to gain equity?\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019ve realized this far along into my first semester in APASD is that I have much to learn about the dynamics of those identities and what role they play in API activism. First, the perks of being an APASD intern: I have found a new home in the office, where interns take care of logistical tasks but also study or hang out between classes.\r\n\r\nNow a 5th-year Psychology major, fellow intern Alyssa Ablao recalls attending APIICON while in her second year at De Anza Community College in Cupertino. Alyssa says, \u201cIt was a life changing event that influenced my decision to pick UC Berkeley.\u201d After being involved with the organization APA Student Leadership (APASL) at De Anza, she wanted to find out more about the planning team for APIICON and join a committee. Now Alyssa also sees the office as a second home: \u201cEveryone there is a representative from a different community, so I\u2019m constantly exposed to the events and interests of a variety of spaces. I also get to interact with everyone who comes in and out of the office, so I feel like I\u2019m always connected to the rest of the API community.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe best part about being an intern for me is that it doesn\u2019t feel like work: besides the regular events like CAPAW and APIICON, interns have the freedom to come up with and implement any ideas for activities they want. From collaborating with interns and other students outside of MSD to help plan CAPAW (a semi-formal banquet which took place on November 18), we built a bond through our shared interest in illuminating the stories of womyn who have struggled in silence. I\u2019m proud of the small but strong team of womyn who put in hours late at night to make CAPAW happen, and it was inspiring to hear activists like Mia Nakano and Julia Rhee tell their stories.\r\n\r\nRuby Lim, a 4th-year Anthropology major in her first year at APASD, summed it up best: \u201cThis year\u2019s cohort is actually smaller than in the previous years, creating a more intimate space. Each one of us all come from different groups and organizations that helped mold this unique cohort. This space helps build cultural awareness not only in just API and APAs, but also cross-culturally because APASD is one of the Multicultural Student Development offices.\u201d\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s be real though: events like CAPAW are a privilege to put on and attend. Not everything that happens in student advocacy work looks that glamorous, and it never should appear that way.\r\n\r\nInterns sit through weekly meetings that sometimes end past 10 pm, often after a long day of classes. For those who were involved in either CAPAW or APIICON, that meant additional meetings throughout the week. We have our disagreements, and we\u2019re not all best friends with each other or our neighbors in MSD. Few people outside of the space make use of the mental health services provided by API Connect, a counseling resource for students seeking support either in academics or personal life. Last-minute complications will often arise the day of events we plan, and we just do our best to deal with whom and what we\u2019ve got. And therein lies the beauty of APASD: we make the most of what we have because our predecessors did the same in order for us to have a foundation on which to build.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":27,"created_at":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 17:36:31 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 17:37:45 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 17:36:31 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2650,"title":"One Heart One Beat","slug":"one-heart-one-beat","markdown":"\nby jessie kong For many students, the end of fall semester ushers in the usual season blues and holiday spirit, but for the student organization PAHC, the Pilipin@ Association for Health Careers, it brings forth a different vibe\u2014a feeling of compassion and passion to give back to the community. Since 1998, PAHC has held the Annual Medical Mission Benefit Concert in an effort to raise funds for PMSNC\u2019s (Philippine Medical Society of Northern California) Annual Medical Mission to a province in need. This year\u2019s theme is One Heart One Beat, a phrase that emphasizes the collaborative efforts of the community, both within PAHC and beyond the UC campus, to raise enough funds for the select few individuals to embark on the medical mission. Beyond the obvious student effort that goes into the process, the support of local businesses and collaboration between professionals in the health field make this Medical Mission a reality in changing the lives of those in need. Long before the 15-year history of the Medical Mission Benefit Concert held at Cal, PAHC and PMSNC have been working together with the Medical Mission. In the beginning, past PAHC members were oftentimes related to doctors within PMSNC. Emily Cabebe, the first PUMP (Pilipin@ Undergraduate Mission Program) Coordinator, describes, \u201cThe mission is very much coordinated by these doctors who were born in the Philippines, and they knew the provinces.\u201d Students on the mission were able to go to areas where the doctors had actually practiced before, and the development of a familial bond helped shape the care given in previous medical missions. Fifteen years later, Cal alumni on the medical mission still work to serve underserved communities, preserving the tradition of familial connection. Last year\u2019s PUMP coordinator Melanie Dumalag relates, \u201cI think every time you see patients it\u2019s refreshing to be able to connect with people in your homeland and have similar stories in terms of how their family lives. Every minute you\u2019re there it\u2019s rewarding because you\u2019re out of your comfort zone and vulnerable to change. You\u2019re allowing yourself to change your mind, outlook, and perspective, and that\u2019s the most rewarding part of it all.\u201d The impoverished conditions and rural areas within the Philippines were of no surprise to past Medical Mission volunteers Mark Esguerra and Patricia Mora. However, the extent of their contribution and compassion behind their efforts were surprisingly unexpected. As Patricia expresses, \u201cIt blew my mind\u2026 there were so many people, and we were there for only four days.\u201d The volunteers provided a number of medical services addressing a wide range of health conditions, including vitamin deficiencies, coughing, cyst removal, tumors, and other common conditions found amongst a large population of patients in the provinces. Unfortunately, setbacks such as the depletion of supplies called for improvements within the program, including intervention of preventable diseases through proper nutrition and increased education. Despite these setbacks, every volunteer gained a unique, enlightening experience. Mark and Patricia both expressed a reinforced desire, motivation, and force in pursuing a health career. Overall, the impact of the medical mission was emotional and heartfelt for the volunteers. The Medical Mission Benefit Concert held during the fall semester calls for awareness and support for the Medical Mission and selected candidates. This year, the two PUMP coordinators in charge of organizing the Medical Mission Benefit Concert, Mark Arganda and Michael Valerio, will partake in the Medical Mission to Pangasinan. Before applying, Mark was already familiar with the health and community issues that he will face on the Medical Mission.\u00a0 According to Mark, although different provinces have different issues, \u201cmany have the same similarities such as lack of access and resources... Because these communities lack access to health care or medication, they probably have conditions that are not very prevalent [in the United States], such as the large tumors that many patients were seen with last year.\u201d Although the Medical Mission is only a temporary bandage to the greater issues of health care in the Philippines, as the same problems from 15 years ago recur today, the PMSNC\u2019s Medical Mission serves as a vehicle for change in many reinforcing ways. Despite thousands of miles in ocean, Pilipin@s in their homeland receive the warm compassion of care from their \u201ckababayan\u201d fellows who are there to effect change, including a change in the life of a mother who gets a five-pound tumor removed from her neck. The students are the mobilizing forces of the future who will learn from these experiences and continue to change the lives of their fellow people in the Philippines. Other than the Medical Mission Benefit Concert, in the spring semester PAHC, along with the Chicanos\/Latinos in Health Education (CHE) and Black Students in Health Association (BSHA), holds the Minorities in Health Conference to inspire minority high school and college students to pursue careers in health. PAHC also has an internship program that provides professional and emotional development for students to pursue a career in the healthcare community. Beyond all the wholesome work PAHC does, it is important to remember that 27 years ago PAHC started off as an actual family of brothers and cousins, and to this day PAHC continues as a space for a group of people to feel that familial aspect. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n","html":"by jessie kong\r\n\r\nFor many students, the end of fall semester ushers in the usual season blues and holiday spirit, but for the student organization PAHC, the Pilipin@ Association for Health Careers, it brings forth a different vibe\u2014a feeling of compassion and passion to give back to the community.

Opinion articles exploded on the Internet, spreading the controversy like wildfire. Since then, the company has decided to close the \u201cGo East\u201d collection, redirecting users who search for the product to the Victoria\u2019s Secret homepage. \u00a0 Seldom tasteful, Victoria\u2019s Secret reached a new low by releasing a product without being sensitive to a history of messy racial politics, in which Asian women faced exploitation, colonization, and sexualization by Western culture. These racial obstacles are clear in the portrayal of Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s outfit; the diction of the product description and the way that the product is modeled is charged with negative racial and gender connotations toward Asian women. These two problems stem from a history of European colonization in Asia and a paradigm of white (male) privilege in our society, which often go unnoticed because of the degree to which they are culturally normalized. \u00a0 First of all, the product\u2019s intention is to make the wearer feel like a \u201cSexy Little Geisha.\u201d Through sexualization, Victoria\u2019s Secret waters down the history of Japanese geishas, who offered much more artistically and culturally than just sex. This particular incident shows us how Asian women are portrayed as mindless objects of eroticism in Western culture. Rarely do we see intelligent, gumption-filled Asian female characters like Cristina Yang from the television show *Grey\u2019s Anatomy*. The media glorifies the perfect Asian female as docile and submissive in both the white and Asian communities. \u00a0 In addition to the way the product description is worded, the portrayal of the outfit also raises a concern. Note that a white woman modeled the \u201cSexy Little Geisha\u201d outfit. The painful implication is that the outfit is only \u201csexy\u201d on a white female body, or what our nation normatively deems as the universal woman citizen. Western fantasies cannot involve women of color even if they are the ones being directly exploited; the fantasy must be executed by a white woman. This brings the issue of race to the table\u2014why is Asian so often considered \u201cforeign\u201d? \u00a0 Upon hearing about this controversy, I was reminded of an observation paper I had to write for my Gender and Women\u2019s Studies class here at Cal, in which I studied cosmetic product arrangements at Walgreen\u2019s. Unfortunately, the subjugation of Asian women is not a new idea. When I entered Walgreen\u2019s, I analyzed the arrangement of beauty products and how well they were divided into social categories. When I passed by the cosmetic and hygiene products, I noticed four shelves of hair dye that featured primarily Caucasian models\u2014there were very few Latina, Black, and Asian models. Interestingly, the hair dye boxes with the non-Caucasian models were placed together. What does this show us? Asian women, and more broadly, women of color, are seen as less important within our culture, and the number of nonwhite models displayed on beauty products reflects this claim. Women of color do not fit the heteronormative standard of white beauty. When they are visible in the media, they are rarely celebrated because of a long, negative history of sexualization. The \u201cSexy Little Geisha\u201d outfit is a primary example of this history\u2014the fact that the outfit is sported by a white woman insinuates that white is associated with beauty, while color is associated with promiscuity and cultural inferiority. Such a pattern of racist body politics repeats endlessly in the beauty industry through the commercial promotion of different garments and cosmetic products. \u00a0 The idea of a sexually and mentally submissive Asian woman is so culturally and historically ingrained in Western culture that the notion of the \u201cSexy Little Geisha\u201d outfit seemed immediately harmless, maybe even funny or hot. But the very notion of the \u201cSexy Little Geisha\u201d operates on power dynamics between race and gender. Products like this render people of all different races and genders insensitive to a history of Orientalism, which has reinforced xenophobia against Asians throughout history. The concept of Orientalism implies that people of Asian descent do not belong within Western culture, that they are foreigners who should remain silent and submissive. If issues like the \u201cSexy Little Geisha\u201d outfit aren\u2019t addressed, Asian stereotypes will be recycled throughout many more generations. \u00a0 By capitalizing upon stereotypes, companies like Victoria\u2019s Secret reproduce negative ideas about Asian women in mainstream society, portraying them as \u201cexotic\u201d and sexually attainable. And this isn\u2019t the first time the culturally-insensitive fashion industry has capitalized on racist and sexist stereotypes; the controversies not only extend to Asian women, but also other women of color. Issues revolving around the portrayal of African women and Native American women also sparked up in the fashion industry lately through, interestingly enough, Victoria\u2019s Secret. These controversies are relevant to the Asian community because it too has suffered from cultural objectification on top of many negative stereotypes. Communities of color must work together and strive to deconstruct many hackneyed portrayals of people of color. \u00a0 Why is it so important to address the racism and sexism in this particular item as well as other countless products that convey similar messages? One might say that this controversial product is an innocuous caricature of a long-worn stereotype, and that it is about as racially harmful as a French maid costume. While people do have individual sexual desires, the social construction of sex, along with race and gender, have an intricate relationship, in which they are created through each other through historical and social reinforcement. With more and more reinforcement, Asians and Asian cultures are belittled and caricaturized to entertain Western audiences. \u00a0 It\u2019s hard for me not to cringe or feel indignant when racially-insensitive portrayals appear in mainstream media. The \u201cSexy Little Geisha\u201d costume is harmful not in what it shows, but in what it implies about the role of Asian women in our culture. When we buy into racialized stereotypes, we help reinforce negative cultural norms and we strip people of their dignity. Racism today differs greatly from the racism that people of color experienced 60 years ago, but it is still very much alive today in politics, media, and even daily interactions.\n\n\n","html":"by stacey nguyen\r\n\r\nTasteless, trite, and troubling, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s release of its \u201cGo East\u201d collection with the notorious \u201cSexy Little Geisha\u201d outfit on its website sparked an online controversy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRecently, the lingerie company released an \u201cEastern-inspired\u201d cutout sheer mesh teddy\u2014with matching removable obi belt, fan and chopsticks\u2014describing it as a \u201cticket to an exotic adventure.\u201d Many considered the outfit racially insensitive and objectifying of Asian culture.

While my parents and sister converse with each other in Korean, I pick at my food, completely ignorant of the conversation because I never learned how to speak my parents\u2019 native language. In some ways, it\u2019s sad to acknowledge that I am every bit the twinkie or banana (yellow on the outside, white on the inside) some of my fellow APIs have called me, as the basic root of my heritage\u2014a language that connects me to my family at home and abroad\u2014has never established itself into my being. \u00a0 I have no explanation for this. Perhaps it was the fact that I went to schools where, most of the time, I was the only Asian kid. It\u2019s not like my parents didn\u2019t try to teach me. They enrolled me in Korean Saturday schools that we had to drive for an hour to attend, where the teachers taught me basic words and phrases and were upset when I spoke to them only in English. Somehow, I never made that jump to fluency. And I can\u2019t blame my environment either. I only have to look at my sister to see that a lack of Asian peers doesn\u2019t stop someone from learning another language. One possibility is that my sister was more outgoing, while I was an introvert who shied away from his own parents. \u00a0 Still, for the most part I grew up more or less alone in my ethnicity, having neither peers nor family to whom I could really connect. Whatever void I had from not being truly Korean was filled with Americanization. I grew up liking punk rock. I ate pizza and would try to skip Korean dinners. I played football in high school. In essence, I was \u201cwhite-washed.\u201d \u00a0 I suppose the only real Asian thing about me was my parents\u2019 insistence that I go to college, which meant a great deal of scrutinizing my academics. Although there was perpetual difficulty in communicating with my parents, my mother knew enough English to tell me why an education was important, and frequently checked in on my academics. On the contrary, my father was a specter in the background who would only have something to say in Korean, so my mother or sister would have to translate for me to understand. \u00a0 So now here I am, a Berkeley student, and all of a sudden there are fucking Asians everywhere. It\u2019s strange, it\u2019s frightening, it\u2019s new, but most of all, it\u2019s exciting. Coming to college was my first real experience with Asian diversity. Yet I soon came to realize how different I was from many of my fellow Asian peers, especially the Koreans. \u00a0 For starters, most of the other students knew how to speak their heritage language to some degree. Many also seemed to have a strong sense of community with fellow Asians in general\u2014connections that had been built since childhood. These are the same people who are incredulous when I tell them how, in my high school of two thousand students, only twenty were APIs across all four grade levels. In particular, I am reminded of the time a group of Korean American students and I were inebriated, and the group decided to start singing the Korean national anthem. I just stood there with a blank expression, not knowing what the hell was going on, and I felt a bit ashamed for not knowing the words. \u00a0 To be ignorant of the culture and to not be able to identify with it is an interesting challenge. I am in a perpetual state of limbo between two cultures in which I can never fully participate. On one hand, I am an industrious working citizen who is a product of the American education system. But I'll never be just American. On the other hand, I have an obligation to a culture that is undeniably connected to me through my ancestry, and marks my physicality. But I'll never be just Asian. \u00a0 So how can a person participate within the Asian American community when he feels like a white guy with Asian skin? \u00a0 It's hard. It's a day-to-day process that requires proactive involvement by educating myself about the struggles and issues the Asian American community faces, and the history from which those struggles come. But only through participation have I been able to overcome the cultural gap separating me from the greater Asian American community. \u00a0 Despite all the gains I\u2019ve made by becoming more active with the political struggles of the API community, there is still something lacking in my life, something that continues to deeply unsettle me. \u00a0 The greatest fear in my life is this haunting scenario that I wish to never face. It involves my father on his deathbed, and he is struggling to explain how much he loves me, giving me last-second life advice in his broken English because he knows I won\u2019t understand his Korean. He desperately translates his Korean thoughts into fractured English, and when he\u2019s said all that he can, he\u2019ll smile, close his eyes, and then pass away, gone forever. \u00a0 I know I won't cry at first. The shock will be too much, but eventually it will sink in. When it does, I will break into pieces, cursing myself for not knowing enough Korean to understand my father completely and hear him speak uninhibited by the cultural barriers that have long separated us. \u00a0 This is not a fear that I\u2019ve kept secret from my peers. Yet somehow, the response comes to me as callous. \u00a0 *\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal, just learn it.\u201d* \u00a0 I can. I\u2019m trying. But what saddens me is that I\u2019ve lost the opportunity to have that fluency option available only to kids. I will be more like a foreigner trying to learn Korean, and will always sound like a foreigner every time I speak it. I will never truly be that \u201cKorean\u201d in Korean-American. \u00a0 As depressing as this truth is, I refuse to give up.

However, *Cloud Atlas *distinguishes itself from the recent glut of bombastic mainstream cinema. For one thing, it\u2019s not even a product of Hollywood. The Wachowski and Tom Tykwer triple-directed mega-feature is actually a German-produced film, and stands as one of the most expensive and thematically ambitious independent films of all time. For another thing, there is one ingredient in *Cloud Atlas* that has stirred up controversy since the release of the 2012 sci-fi film: Yellowface. Accusations of Yellowface have been issued by MANAA (Media Action Network for Asian Americans). Racebending.com defines Yellowface as \u201cthe practice of applying prostheses or paint to simulate a crude idea of what \u2018Asians\u2019 look like; it is non-Asian bodies (usually white) controlling what it means to be Asian on screen and stage, particularly in lead\/major roles.\u201d Here we\u2019ll examine just exactly what\u2019s up with Yellowface, a system of codes and practices that has left a tainted presence on the representation of Asian American culture ever since Warner Oland first donned the Fu Manchu moustache in 1929. However, I\u2019m going to pump the brakes on the all-out barrage against this unsettling portrayal of Asians in a big-budget feature like *Cloud Atlas*\u2014not because I don\u2019t care, but because I feel like a more substantiated approach toward examining the film must be taken in order to find the merits and even the reason behind this controversy. Therefore, I contend that the use of Yellowface in *Cloud Atlas*, while visually problematic and occasionally bizarre, should not be seen as overtly racist and\/or discriminatory, but rather as a testament to the complexity of the casting process for film adaptation. This article will provide a spoiler-free overview of performance within the film, with an emphasis on Jim Sturgess, a man who has increasingly become the yes-man for Yellowface. I have nothing against Jim Sturgess as an actor, or as a person for that matter. I\u2019ve enjoyed his performances in *Across the Universe* (2007) and *The Other Boleyn Girl* (2009)*. *But it\u2019s become clear that Hollywood is gearing him to be the go-to guy to represent Asia\u2014through the body of a brunette, green-eyed English male. Sturgess was cast as the lead in *21 *(2009), a film based on the story of a primarily Asian American group of MIT students who take Las Vegas by storm. I mean, sure it was disappointing to watch Hollywood once again white-wash a true story and reinforce stereotypes for the sake of higher box office returns, but it was still an entertaining movie. The film was a veritable missed opportunity to launch the career of an aspiring AA actor or actress, and a shame at that, but the economy of entertainment is such a prominent force in driving the studio system. \u00a0 So what\u2019s up with *Cloud Atlas*? As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s not a Hollywood film. But even so, after viewing the three-hour epic, I was still able to identify how deeply embedded some ideologies about race, cultural exclusion, and perfunctory stereotypes are from the perspective of white directors and screenwriters. Sturgess is one of eight main characters in *Cloud Atlas*, in which he dons roles ranging from Adam Ewing, an American lawyer whose health begins to deteriorate as he journeys home to San Francisco during the gold rush on a ship, to Hae-Joo Chang, the charismatic leader of a rebellion set in futuristic, dystopian \u201cNeo-Seoul.\u201d \u00a0 Without ruining any of the plot points, I would like to say that it\u2019s lamentable that Hae-Joo Chang had to be portrayed by a white actor. It really is. Chang kicks ass. He saves the leading lady Sumni (played by Doona Bae) multiple times. He brings Sunmi to his perfectly quaint Oriental home (where he proceeds to have sex with her). He\u2019s incredibly intelligent and thoughtful. Not a single thread of his fake black hair is out of place. This character is a genuine action hero, in the same vein as Ethan Hunt or James Bond. Chang could have been a true revolutionary in his own right with respect to breaking the glass ceiling on the limited roles available to actors of Asian descent, yet all of our community\u2019s media dreams and aspirations are discounted when Sturgess puts on the prosthetics and his meek, yet firm take on a Korean man\u2019s voice and mannerisms. \u00a0 The Wachowskis have come to their film\u2019s defense by urging audiences to reflect on their own viewing biases and asking us to see that \u201chumanity is the true character of the story.\u201d I do respect that perspective, but I can\u2019t help but feel cheated when I see such a well-developed and significant role fit for an Asian (because the character *is* Asian) go to someone who doesn\u2019t really need this kind of screen credit. Sturgess already claimed his mainstream breakthrough with 2007\u2019s *Across the Universe*, and his screen credit as Hae-Joo Chang will likely go down as yet another controversial casting decision mired in his young but successful career. But I digress. The \u201cinter-connectivity\u201d of the film\u2014having the same actors play different characters and bodies throughout\u2014makes \u00a0it hard to thematically justify having an Asian actor replace Sturgess (as that same actor would have to play five other characters, likely resulting in Whiteface). Therefore, one can argue that Yellowface was an unavoidable byproduct of the source material\u2019s cinematic ambition. \u00a0 Well\u2026it could have at least been done well. My goodness, Hugo Weaving as a Korean consulate member looks like Spock. And why the heck did they have to yellowface African American actor Keith David? They didn\u2019t even bother lightening his skin pigment! He literally just had black hair and slanted eyes! Come on! \u00a0 Doona Bae\u2019s character Somni in *Cloud Atlas* continually references the fact that she \u201cwill not be subjected to criminal abuse.\u201d Though our viewing of *Cloud Atlas* is hardly seen as an abusive experience, the (poorly done) use of yellowface sure feels criminal. Somni repeatedly asks Sturgess\u2019s Hae-Joo Chang, \u201cWho are you?\u201d throughout the course of their encounter and romance, to which he replies: \u201cOur lives are not our own.\u201d Clearly, the actor didn\u2019t realize the irony of such a statement.\n\n\n","html":"by \u00a0christian ting\r\n\r\nWith a budget of over 100 million dollars and boasting an international ensemble cast ranging from Tom Hanks and Halle Berry to Doona Bae, Zhou Xun, and Hugo Weaving, <em>Cloud Atlas<\/em> may appear to contain all the elements of the standard Hollywood blockbuster.\r\n\r\nHowever, <em>Cloud Atlas <\/em>distinguishes itself from the recent glut of bombastic mainstream cinema.

They talk about how it\u2019s home to many campus and Bay Area breakers, or break-dancers, and how you\u2019ll find yourself weaving your way through flying limbs when they train on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. For over a decade, Dwinelle Hall has been a hot spot for seasoned and budding breakers all over the Bay Area, a large number of whom are Asian Pacific American. These practices attract breakers from all over California as well as other states and have even attracted international dancers. Dwinelle Hall is a space where hip-hop dancers of all styles have congregated and built a community and is part of the UC Berkeley culture. Throughout the years, these dancers have encountered numerous issues with campus administration over use of the space\u2014the building managers and janitors did not like the scuff marks left on the hallway floors by the dancers nor the loud music being played. Despite their long history and visibility on campus, the community was never an official organization and thus would often be kicked out of Dwinelle without warning. In the hopes of settling the issue of using Dwinelle, 3rd-year Political Economy student and b-girl Lilly Sedaghat found a faculty sponsor and filled out all the paperwork to legitimize the Dwinelle Hall Breakers as an ASUC student group this past year. By becoming an official campus organization and following all safety rules, the Dwinelle Hall Breakers thought they would finally be recognized by the administration. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case at all. In October, they were kicked out of Dwinelle Hall and barred from dancing there once again. The new building manager, Rubin Mejia, expelled the breakers from their home despite the fact that the Dwinelle Hall Breakers followed all fire and safety regulations. Without Dwinelle Hall, there would no longer be a space for these dancers to come together as a community. Dwinelle Hall is a space where people have come together to dance, study, hang out, and in some instances\u2026sleep. If the Dwinelle Hall Breakers were kicked out and banned from using the space to dance, all other students who use the hall would be susceptible to vacating the space as well. After all, the Dwinelle Hall Breakers are not the only ones throughout the school year who use Dwinelle Hall to dance, sing, and hang-out. This fight\u2014at its core\u2014is not just about giving Dwinelle Hall back to the Dwinelle Hall Breakers. It is about the basic right every student and person who walks onto this campus has to use public spaces. Breaking is more than a hobby for these individuals. It is an art, a culture, a community. For this community, breakdancing is a form of empowerment and self-expression. It is a creative outlet and can even be an escape from stress due to school or home. Losing Dwinelle Hall wasn\u2019t the loss of an arbitrary space for the dancers. It was the loss of home and their identity. For dancers of all styles, a place to train, practice, and hone their craft is essential. Taking away Dwinelle Hall for the breakers would be equivalent to taking away a photographer\u2019s camera or a writer\u2019s pen and paper, the mediums that make their passion possible. But why Dwinelle Hall? Why not go to another campus building? Why not go to Hearst Gym or the RSF? It\u2019s simple. Dwinelle Hall is their home. It is where they began and where they want to continue to be. Dwinelle is a public space and a large number of those who had come there to dance are not students at UC Berkeley. Most of the dancers would never be able to go into Hearst Gym or the RSF in the evenings because they either do not have a Cal ID or cannot afford to pay ridiculously pricey gym membership fees. Also, moving to another open campus building would result in the dancers being kicked out anyway. Dancing in the gyms would make practices inherently exclusive. That is not what this community is about nor is it what the administration should be indirectly trying to impose. Dancing at Dwinelle Hall has always been open to the public. It has always been a free, all-inclusive, and multicultural environment. The color of your skin, your age, your school, your economic background, the skill level and style of your dancing, even your preference in socks and shoes\u2014none of this matters when you walk into Dwinelle Hall to dance. That is how it has always been and how it should continue to be. In an effort to demonstrate just how important Dwinelle Hall is to the dancing community, bill SB 167 was created. SB 167 is a ASUC Senate bill in opposition to the removal of the Dwinelle Hall Breakers from dancing in Dwinelle Hall and was unanimously passed in the Senate meeting held on November 7 this month. When presented to the ASUC the bill was unanimously supported by all senators and was even sponsored by senators across all party lines. Although the bill has passed, the struggle is not over. The bill wants ASUC President Conner Landgraf to work with the dance community advocate, Senator Rosemary Hua, to write letters to Vice Chancellor Harry LeGrande, the LEAD Center Interim Director Jeff Woods, and the ASUC Auxiliary Director Kelsey Finn, urging them to have Dwinelle Hall building manager Rubin Mejia lift the ban on the Dwinelle Hall Breakers. This campus is famous for the 1960\u2019s Free Speech Movement, a movement where students fought and protested for their right to free speech and by extension, the right to free expression\u2014one of the most fundamental purposes of breakdancing. By denying the Dwinelle Hall Breakers an open, all-inclusive space to dance in, the administration is going against one of its greatest legacies. Because of their presence and contributions to this campus over the years, the Dwinelle Hall Breakers more than deserve Dwinelle Hall has a dancing space. This community of remarkable dancers and individuals deserve recognition and respect at all levels.

They talk about how it\u2019s home to many campus and Bay Area breakers, or break-dancers, and how you\u2019ll find yourself weaving your way through flying limbs when they train on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.\r\n\r\nFor over a decade, Dwinelle Hall has been a hot spot for seasoned and budding breakers all over the Bay Area, a large number of whom are Asian Pacific American. These practices attract breakers from all over California as well as other states and have even attracted international dancers. Dwinelle Hall is a space where hip-hop dancers of all styles have congregated and built a community and is part of the UC Berkeley culture.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years, these dancers have encountered numerous issues with campus administration over use of the space\u2014the building managers and janitors did not like the scuff marks left on the hallway floors by the dancers nor the loud music being played. Despite their long history and visibility on campus, the community was never an official organization and thus would often be kicked out of Dwinelle without warning. In the hopes of settling the issue of using Dwinelle, 3rd-year Political Economy student and b-girl Lilly Sedaghat found a faculty sponsor and filled out all the paperwork to legitimize the Dwinelle Hall Breakers as an ASUC student group this past year. By becoming an official campus organization and following all safety rules, the Dwinelle Hall Breakers thought they would finally be recognized by the administration.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the case at all. In October, they were kicked out of Dwinelle Hall and barred from dancing there once again. The new building manager, Rubin Mejia, expelled the breakers from their home despite the fact that the Dwinelle Hall Breakers followed all fire and safety regulations. Without Dwinelle Hall, there would no longer be a space for these dancers to come together as a community.\r\n\r\nDwinelle Hall is a space where people have come together to dance, study, hang out, and in some instances\u2026sleep. If the Dwinelle Hall Breakers were kicked out and banned from using the space to dance, all other students who use the hall would be susceptible to vacating the space as well. After all, the Dwinelle Hall Breakers are not the only ones throughout the school year who use Dwinelle Hall to dance, sing, and hang-out. This fight\u2014at its core\u2014is not just about giving Dwinelle Hall back to the Dwinelle Hall Breakers.

The Eta Prime chapter of Kappa Sigma sent a racist email to their listserv where they mocked the stereotypical Chinese\u00a0accent as seen in movies and television shows. They used phrases such as \u201cHerro\u201d and \u201cChank You\u201d in their email in place of \u201chello\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d.[[1]](\/Users\/Patty\/Documents\/hardboiled\/patty%20duke%20final.docx#_ftn1) This email invited the addressee to attend their \u201cAsia Prime\u201d party. When recipients of this email reported it to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, Kappa Sigma sent an email the following day cancelling the \u201cAsia Prime\u201d party and announced that they would host an \u201cInternational Relations: A celebration of all cultures and the diversity of Duke\u201d instead.[[2]](\/Users\/Patty\/Documents\/hardboiled\/patty%20duke%20final.docx#_ftn2) \u00a0The pictures taken at the party displayed partygoers wearing Asian-themed costumes, such as a sumo suit, a rice paddy hat, and kimonos.\n\n After news spread about this party, the national headquarters of Kappa Sigma suspended this chapter as it holds an investigation while the Duke University administration did not respond at all. Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs, dismissed this incident as nothing more than a \u201cboorish and foolish\u201d fraternity party.[[3]](\/Users\/Patty\/Documents\/hardboiled\/patty%20duke%20final.docx#_ftn3)\u00a0The university did suspend the fraternity, but for non-related undisclosed issues. The Asian Student Alliance (ASA) organized a rally and several members of ASA placed posters all over campus containing pictures taken at the party with descriptions that draw attention to the racism present in the partygoers\u2019 outfits. ASA demanded an \u201capology of action\u201d from the fraternity and called for a Group Bias Task Force.[[4]](\/Users\/Patty\/Documents\/hardboiled\/patty%20duke%20final.docx#_ftn4) That night, ASA and the Duke Student Government hosted an open discussion where 10 Kappa Sigma brothers attended.

First, it repeats the historical pattern of enforcing an Orientalized identity on and presentation of Asian and Asian Americans as the racial \u201cOther\u201d that separates them from the general American society. Second, it has a material effect on the lives of Asian and Asian Americans who have to resist the media\u2019s reductive portrayal of their identity and culture. The partygoers distilled various Asian cultures into select orientalized images of Asians as the racial \u201cOther\u201d. They have reduced an entire plethora of Asian cultures into a stereotypical display of the Chinese and the Japanese culture as representative of all Asian cultures, an assumption held by many. They have placed an entire culture and identity on a display as the \u201cOther\u201d for everyone to look at as an object of ridicule. While it may seem as if these college students were participating in harmless fun by putting on these costumes, they are illustrating how they see Asians as separate from the partygoers\u2019 normalized view of the world. They put on these exoticized garbs as a way of marking the different Asian cultures as homogenous and radically distinctive from the rest of the American public. They have reduced the term \u201cAsian\u201d to only refer to Japanese and Chinese ethnicities while furthering reducing these cultures by implying that the entirety of the Chinese culture can be summed up to rice paddy hats and the Japanese culture to sumo wrestling costumes. By dressing in this manner, they have displayed why Asians are so different from the \u201crest\u201d of America. The partygoers present Asian cultures as costumes fit for the drunken antics of a college fraternity party thus stripping these representations of Asians from its historical context. By orientalizing the Asian identity, they have drawn attention to the difference between Asians and Americans, thus presenting Asian Americans as different from \u201cnormal\u201d Americans.

By putting on these costumes and mocking the different Asian cultures, the partygoers\u2019 are reiterating this narrative that Asians and Asian Americans are irrevocably separate from the American society.

When I first got a hold of the article, oblivious to its author, my first reaction was a familiar one: \u201cWho is this white man writing about my people?\u201d As I started to read, I went from anger to confusion to eye-rolling to more confusion. Friends shared the article on Facebook, some clearly oblivious of the fact that it was a satire, defending their family\u2019s academic and professional success. I\u2019m still not sure if I\u2019m more upset that they didn\u2019t realize the article\u2019s irony or that their hurt is real. Let\u2019s just put it out there: McInnes\u2019 article is a satire. He is making a commentary on white privilege. While many of his readers may have taken his words at face value, I don\u2019t doubt that McInnes is a smart guy, that he is actually challenging the white privilege of many of his readers. But there is an irony behind the irony. The greater irony is that McInnes, in his hopes to highlight and challenge privilege, actually falls victim to the very thing he is standing against. McInnes can afford to write an ironic article that uses examples of \u201cAsian privilege\u201d as a rhetorical launching point, but not everyone has the luxury of seeing it thus. For my friends who read the article and immediately posted their 140-character rebuttal on Twitter, McInnes\u2019 article is not mere satire; it stings. The same holds true for other feeble attempts at racial satire. UC Berkeley students remember well the Affirmative Action Bakesale. Despite our value for free speech, there is a clear difference between good and thoughtful satire and a satire that is destructive and assholish. People who, even with the best intentions, do thoughtless things in the name of racial free speech must be willing to deal with the harm they cause, with the communities they insult. And \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke, stop taking it so seriously.\u201d does not count as an apology. McInnes\u2019 article hit too close to home and was not quite ridiculous enough. But why should I have expected him to anticipate how Asian Americans would feel about his article? He has no framework for our consciousness, no understanding of how his salty words fall into the open wounds of our community. Many of my friends went on the defensive after the first two paragraphs; of course I don\u2019t blame them for pushing back on their Facebook statuses and blogs. Gavin McInnes, you\u2019ve clearly done your research, I don\u2019t doubt your good intentions, but please do not use us as a chess piece in your exposition on privilege.

The pictures taken at the party displayed partygoers wearing Asian-themed costumes, such as a sumo suit, a rice paddy hat, and kimonos. After news spread about this party, the national headquarters of Kappa Sigma suspended this chapter as it to holds an investigation while the Duke University administration did not respond at all. Larry Moneta, Duke's Vice President for of Student Affairs, dismissed this incident as nothing more than a \u201cboorish and foolish\u201d fraternity party. The university also did suspended the fraternity, but for non-related undisclosed issues reasons . The Asian Student Alliance (ASA) organized a rally and several members of ASA placed posters all over campus containing pictures taken at the party with descriptions that draw attention to the racism present in the partygoers\u2019 outfits. ASA demanded an \u201capology of action\u201d from the fraternity and called for a Group Bias Task Force. That night, ASA and the Duke Student Government hosted an open discussion where 10 Kappa Sigma brothers attended. In this meeting, the Eta Prime chapter\u2019s president, Luke Keohane, stated that the fraternity did not wish to \u201cdefend\u201d their actions, but came to \u201clearn\u201d from this discussion. Later, he wrote in an email that Kappa Sigma should not have hosted this party after the initial backlash over its racialized theme. Almost two weeks after Kappa Sigma hosted this party, a coalition of student leaders, including members of Kappa Sigma, met with administrators to present a list of demands. They called for the formation of a Group Bias Incident Task Force, which would give students the power to \u201c\u2018collaboratively decide and implement accountability or reparative measures\u2019\u201d. They wished wanted to include of the phrase \u201cI will value others regardless of race, gender, class, sexual orientation or other identity\u201d in the Duke Community Standard and wanted the addition of three full-time Asian American studies Duke faculty members. Moneta believed that these changes would have a positive effect on the Duke campus, but does did not believe that such measures are were necessary and believes that this incident is was an anomaly that does not did not reflect the \u201chealthy culture\u201d at Duke. For those who hold a similar opinion to Moneta, that this incident does not warrant any punitive response or acknowledgement from the university, I would like to explain why this party, and others comparable to it, cannot be dismissed without any form of accountability. First, it the racially themed party repeats the historical pattern of enforcing an Orientalized identity on and presentation of Asians and Asian Americans as the racial \u201cOther\u201d that separates them from the general American society. Second, it has had a material effect on the lives of Asian and Asian Americans who have to resist the media\u2019s reductive portrayal of their identity and culture. The partygoers distilled various Asian cultures into select Orientalized images of Asians as the racial \u201cOther\u201d. They have reduced an entire plethora of Asian cultures into a stereotypical display of the Chinese and the Japanese culture as representative of all Asian cultures, an assumption held by many. They have placed an entire culture and identity on a display as the \u201cOther\u201d for everyone to look at as an object of ridicule. While it may seem as if these college students were participating in harmless fun by putting on these costumes, they are illustrating how they see Asians as separate from the partygoers\u2019 normalized view of the world. They put on these exoticized garbs as a way of marking the different Asian cultures as homogenous and radically distinctive from the rest of the American public. They have reduced the term \u201cAsian\u201d to only refer to Japanese and Chinese ethnicities while furthering reducing these cultures by implying that the entirety of the Chinese culture can be summed up to rice paddy hats and the Japanese culture to sumo wrestling costumes. By dressing in this manner, they have displayed why Asians are so different from the \u201crest\u201d of America. The partygoers presented Asian cultures as costumes fit for the drunken antics of a college fraternity party, thus stripping these representations of Asians from its historical context. By orientalizing the Asian identity, they have drawn attention to the differences between Asians and Americans, thus presenting Asian Americans as different from \u201cnormal\u201d Americans. This narrative has been reiterated throughout the centuries and has had substantive consequences for Asian immigrants and Asian Americans. Since the arrival of the first major Asian immigrant group in the 19th century, Americans have marked the Asian body as the racial \u201cOther\u201d, which Americans have used as justification for the exclusion of excluding different Asian immigrants and barring them from the naturalization process, thus further hindering their ability to function as productive members of the American society. They justified the legal, social, political and economic discrimination against Asians by emphasizing the differences in their cultures and in their appearances. By putting on these costumes and mocking the different Asian cultures, the partygoers\u2019 are reiterating this narrative that Asians and Asian Americans are irrevocably separate from the American society. While this party is not unique in its racial insensitivity, it draws attention to the need for the inclusion of Asian American history in our textbooks and the need for the recognition of Asian American history to ensure that our history is not swept aside or forgotten.

The Eta Prime chapter of Kappa Sigma sent a racist email to their listserv where they mocked the stereotypical Chinese accent as seen in movies and television shows. They used phrases such as \u201cHerro\u201d and \u201cChank You\u201d in their email in place of \u201chello\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d. This email and invited the addressee to attend their \u201cAsia Prime\u201d party. When recipients of this email reported it to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, Kappa Sigma sent an email the following day cancelling the \u201cAsia Prime\u201d party and announced that they would host an \u201cInternational Relations: A celebration of all cultures and the diversity of Duke\u201d instead. The pictures taken at the party displayed partygoers wearing Asian-themed costumes, such as a sumo suit, a rice paddy hat, and kimonos.\r\n\r\nAfter news spread about this party, the national headquarters of Kappa Sigma suspended this chapter as it to holds an investigation while the Duke University administration did not respond at all. Larry Moneta, Duke's Vice President for of Student Affairs, dismissed this incident as nothing more than a \u201cboorish and foolish\u201d fraternity party. The university also did suspended the fraternity, but for non-related undisclosed issues reasons . The Asian Student Alliance (ASA) organized a rally and several members of ASA placed posters all over campus containing pictures taken at the party with descriptions that draw attention to the racism present in the partygoers\u2019 outfits. ASA demanded an \u201capology of action\u201d from the fraternity and called for a Group Bias Task Force. That night, ASA and the Duke Student Government hosted an open discussion where 10 Kappa Sigma brothers attended. In this meeting, the Eta Prime chapter\u2019s president, Luke Keohane, stated that the fraternity did not wish to \u201cdefend\u201d their actions, but came to \u201clearn\u201d from this discussion. Later, he wrote in an email that Kappa Sigma should not have hosted this party after the initial backlash over its racialized theme. Almost two weeks after Kappa Sigma hosted this party, a coalition of student leaders, including members of Kappa Sigma, met with administrators to present a list of demands. They called for the formation of a Group Bias Incident Task Force, which would give students the power to \u201c\u2018collaboratively decide and implement accountability or reparative measures\u2019\u201d. They wished wanted to include of the phrase \u201cI will value others regardless of race, gender, class, sexual orientation or other identity\u201d in the Duke Community Standard and wanted the addition of three full-time Asian American studies Duke faculty members. Moneta believed that these changes would have a positive effect on the Duke campus, but does did not believe that such measures are were necessary and believes that this incident is was an anomaly that does not did not reflect the \u201chealthy culture\u201d at Duke.\r\n\r\nFor those who hold a similar opinion to Moneta, that this incident does not warrant any punitive response or acknowledgement from the university, I would like to explain why this party, and others comparable to it, cannot be dismissed without any form of accountability. First, it the racially themed party repeats the historical pattern of enforcing an Orientalized identity on and presentation of Asians and Asian Americans as the racial \u201cOther\u201d that separates them from the general American society. Second, it has had a material effect on the lives of Asian and Asian Americans who have to resist the media\u2019s reductive portrayal of their identity and culture.\r\n\r\nThe partygoers distilled various Asian cultures into select Orientalized images of Asians as the racial \u201cOther\u201d. They have reduced an entire plethora of Asian cultures into a stereotypical display of the Chinese and the Japanese culture as representative of all Asian cultures, an assumption held by many. They have placed an entire culture and identity on a display as the \u201cOther\u201d for everyone to look at as an object of ridicule. While it may seem as if these college students were participating in harmless fun by putting on these costumes, they are illustrating how they see Asians as separate from the partygoers\u2019 normalized view of the world. They put on these exoticized garbs as a way of marking the different Asian cultures as homogenous and radically distinctive from the rest of the American public. They have reduced the term \u201cAsian\u201d to only refer to Japanese and Chinese ethnicities while furthering reducing these cultures by implying that the entirety of the Chinese culture can be summed up to rice paddy hats and the Japanese culture to sumo wrestling costumes. By dressing in this manner, they have displayed why Asians are so different from the \u201crest\u201d of America.\r\n\r\nThe partygoers presented Asian cultures as costumes fit for the drunken antics of a college fraternity party, thus stripping these representations of Asians from its historical context. By orientalizing the Asian identity, they have drawn attention to the differences between Asians and Americans, thus presenting Asian Americans as different from \u201cnormal\u201d Americans. This narrative has been reiterated throughout the centuries and has had substantive consequences for Asian immigrants and Asian Americans. Since the arrival of the first major Asian immigrant group in the 19th century, Americans have marked the Asian body as the racial \u201cOther\u201d, which Americans have used as justification for the exclusion of excluding different Asian immigrants and barring them from the naturalization process, thus further hindering their ability to function as productive members of the American society. They justified the legal, social, political and economic discrimination against Asians by emphasizing the differences in their cultures and in their appearances. By putting on these costumes and mocking the different Asian cultures, the partygoers\u2019 are reiterating this narrative that Asians and Asian Americans are irrevocably separate from the American society.\r\n\r\nWhile this party is not unique in its racial insensitivity, it draws attention to the need for the inclusion of Asian American history in our textbooks and the need for the recognition of Asian American history to ensure that our history is not swept aside or forgotten. This fraternity did not mean to offend anyone, but their ignorance does not excuse their behavior. I commend Kappa Sigma for being open to what the ASA had to say. I give a standing ovation to ASA and their affiliates who promptly resisted Duke\u2019s refusal to react appropriately to this incident. I fully support the demands made by the coalition and urge the Duke administration to handle this situation appropriately and to set a precedent that such racially insensitive behavior will not be tolerated.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":93,"created_at":"Fri, 08 Mar 2013 13:38:28 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 08 Mar 2013 13:38:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":2813,"title":"Being Contrary to the Minority Population","slug":"temp-slug-364","markdown":"\nI'm progressive on most issues.

I recently interviewed Dean and Jordan from Made In Asia NYC, two Filipino-American entertainers from New York City. You can check out their videos [here](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/MadeInAsiaNYC\/)! http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WHJC7Cy7kVs *Tell us a little about yourselves.***Dean**: I\u2019m Dean Banting. I graduated from the City College of New York with a Bachelors Degree in Fine Arts and Film and Video production. I\u2019m a filmmaker and some of my favorite directors are Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, and Martin Scorsese. I love to make all kinds of films, but if you\u2019ve seen our channel, Made In Asia NYC, a lot of it deals with relationships and girlfriends. **Jordan**: My name is Jordan De Los Reyes. I actually handle all of the marketing and PR stuff so any of the posts that you see on Facebook or Twitter\u2014 that\u2019s me right there. *How did you two meet?***Jordan**: I\u2019ve known Dean for a long time. He\u2019s actually a good friend of my brother\u2019s. I\u2019m turning 29 next week and Dean is turning 24; he and my brother are the same age. **Dean**: Yeah, I think [we\u2019ve known each other since] we were six years old. *How did you come up with Made In Asia NYC?***Jordan**: The name itself, well it\u2019s pretty funny, we really didn\u2019t know what we were going to call ourselves and were going through a couple of names. While Dean was working on a script or something he was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up with a list of names?\u201d So I gave him a list and it was a whole bunch of different things like \u201cDean and Jordy TV\u201d, \u201cFilipino Guys\u201d, \u201cAdobo Boys\u201d and stuff like that. One of the names was Made In Asia NYC and that was the one Dean picked. He felt like that it was the best one and the one that stuck out to him. **Dean**: I checked the iPad and scrolled down the list of names and it just rolled off the tip of my tongue. I felt that I could hear other people say \u201cMade in Asia NYC\u201d and [that] it fit perfectly. We started the channel because in December of last year, I quit my full time job though I was doing video editing. At my old job I wasn\u2019t meeting any of my personal goals, like to become a feature film director. Filmmaking was really my passion. With the full time job, even though it was a 9-5, living in NY it was more like 8-7 because the commute was crazy\u2014 it was an hour away. I didn\u2019t have the time to do my own filmmaking so I decided to quit my own job and do freelance. Around the same time, Jordan was laid off of his job at Superdry as a Project Manager. I was watching those \u201cInside the Actors\u201d videos and doing research on what was going on in the current industry. One of the stars up there was Bradley Cooper so I put up a status saying\u00a0 \u201cI want to work with Bradley Cooper in the future.\u201d Jordy commented saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you work with me first?\u201d I sent him a message, \u201cHey man let\u2019s meet up and discuss what you want to do.\u201d So this whole YouTube thing, we talked about a long time ago, maybe three or four years ago; we had great ideas but our ideas never pulled through. In January we met up and were meeting up almost everyday that month to work on our stuff. That\u2019s how Made In Asia NYC was born. **Jordan**: It was all destiny, fate, and the perfect timing. Everything just kind of fell together *Why YouTube?***Dean**: A friend of mine who is also on YouTube, (his name is *Vijay Nazareth*, his channel is AVByte) mentioned to me that in his opinion, YouTube was the new platform for independent filmmakers. Instead of going the traditional route, he felt that there was an audience there that was just waiting to be tapped into. Being a filmmaker myself, I decided that maybe this was a good platform for people to see our work. Lo and behold, our first views reached 3,000 people. I was like, \u201cWow, my first short video I did for school didn\u2019t even reach a thousand people until I got it into festivals.\u201d I see YouTube with so much potential; YouTube is big in the Asian community, so I thought it was good to show people that we are Asian filmmakers. *Are there any other YouTube artists that influence your work?***Jordan**: Actually a lot of people. We received tons of comments that say we remind them of Wong Fu. Wong Fu does a lot of lighthearted short films and skits, and we take that as a compliment. There is no one here in the East Coast that does the same work that we\u2019re doing, so people consider us as the Wong Fu of the East Coast, but actually they\u2019re our biggest inspiration **Dean**: Ryan Higa, KevJumba. Their humor also definitely inspires us, [because] aside us from doing short films about love and all that, we also want to incorporate the same kind of humor that Ryan Higa and KevJumba have in their channels too. *Who do you want to collaborate with and why?***Dean**: Definitely Lana Mc Kissack, [who is] a YouTuber as well. We think she\u2019s fantastic as an actress and [has] personality. She\u2019s definitely one I would like to collaborate with. **Jordan**: I would love to get Kina Grannis to be in one of our videos. She was also on Wong Fu, and she\u2019s really good. She\u2019s a good singer and can act. **Dean**: And every A-list actor and actress out there. **Jordan**: Yeah, we\u2019ll just take them all.\n","html":"<em><\/em>Hey <strong>hardboiled<\/strong>!

Perry* and* United States v. Windsor*<ins cite=\"mailto:Christian%20Ting\" datetime=\"2013-04-15T20:42\">, <\/ins>the issue of same-sex marriage has captured the public\u2019s attention once again. According to SCOTUSblog, *Perry* challenges the constitutionality of California\u2019s Proposition 8 and *Windsor *challenges the constitutionality of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). On the first day that the Supreme Court heard arguments in *Perry* and *Windsor*, controversy over the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s (HRC) red equal sign campaign on Facebook led to fervent debates between those who supported and those who opposed this campaign. Dissenters posted a picture of the \u201cgreater than\u201d sign to illustrate their disapproval of HRC\u2019s anti-transgender stance and\/or their belief that the issues in the queer community transcend this fixation on same-sex marriage. Some felt that the attention on same-sex marriage deferred needed publicity on more pressing issues within the queer community, such as queer youth homelessness, while others characterized same-sex marriage as a way for politicians and media outlets to increase their popularity. While I see their arguments as valid, I did not agree with them. I participated in the red equal sign campaign because I believe in the American creed that all citizens have the same privileges and rights, not because I support the HRC. I agree that the struggles of the queer community surpass the issue of same-sex marriage, but that does not take away its importance. I started to notice that my Facebook friends who identify as allies limit their support for same-sex marriage to passive actions, such as posting Facebook statuses declaring their support. Few allies join organizations that include advocating for the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. My frustration with this trend led me to reflect on my involvement with this issue. I interned at API Equality, an Asian Pacific Islander LGBTIQ (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Intersex Queer) organization based in Chinatown, San Francisco, to put my beliefs to the test. Even though I had never interacted with anyone who identified as queer and API before this internship, I wanted to become an active participant in this fight. As I look back on my decision to join an organization that combines API and queer issues, I realize that I never considered what people would infer about my sexual preference based on where I chose to intern.\u00a0 I saw those who identified as API and queer as people of my community, which led me to conceptualize my involvement as advocating for the API community as well as the queer community. To this day, I proudly tell people that I interned at API Equality with no concern about the implications of this statement. I think many allies do not participate in queer organizations because they do not want others to label them \u201cqueer\u201d, as if that was an insult. I find this a very weak argument against allowing the disenfranchisement of American citizens by their own government. I am confident enough in my sexual preference to accept these implications without offense and I am sure others can do the same. As an intern at API Equality, I soon realized that this organization advocated for issues that went beyond queer issues. At a Chinatown event, I asked people on the street to fill out a survey on their thoughts concerning Proposition 8 and their opinions on what they viewed as the most important issue in the API community, among other questions. This survey highlighted API Equality\u2019s ability to conceptualize identity beyond the fixed and socially constructed categories of race and sexual preference. While API Equality primarily advocates for LGBTIQ acceptance within the API community and racial justice within the LGBTIQ community, it embraces the intersectionality of the queer identity with other foci of identity. For example, they are currently pushing for immigration reform. (To learn more about API Equality, visit www.norcal.apiequality.org\u00a0 and donate at\u00a0www.norcal.apiequality.org\/donate). I think the API community can learn from the inclusive nature of API Equality\u2019s advocacy work. Sometimes we forget that a queer person is not only queer but a conglomeration characteristics that define who they are as a person. In the same way that, a person who identifies as API is not defined by their ethnicity, a person who identifies as queer is not defined by their sexual preference. The purpose of mobilizing based on ethnicity is not to separate ourselves from society, but to assert our voices in a dominant narrative that has consistently excluded our stories. The narrow focus of API organizations should not transfer over to its agenda. A person\u2019s identification with the queer community does not negate their membership in the API community. Furthering the unity of the API community is as important as representing all members of the API community when we talk about API issues. We need to represent those in our community and deal with the issues that affect them even if it does not directly affect us. Every member of this community has their own story that organizations and leaders who claim to represent us need to recognize and accept as part of the API narrative in America. For those in the API community who cry out, \u201cBUT I\u2019M STRAIGHT!!!\u201d I\u2019m happy for you. That\u2019s great, but there are citizens who have been barred from receiving the same privileges as everyone else because a select group of individuals think negatively of them. This issue is still relevant and important to the API community even if it does not affect every member. We all come from different backgrounds, but that shouldn\u2019t be a point of separation. API organizations and collations exist due to the lack of representation in mainstream society, so it\u2019s not okay to treat members of our own community that way. As we assert our voice, we need to put forth an inclusive story that portrays the lives of every member of the API community.\n\n<div><\/div>\n","html":"With\u00a0the Supreme Court <del datetime=\"2013-04-15T20:42\">is <\/del>currently proceeding with <i>Hollingsworth v.

It was my first time attending such a meeting, which may or may not be a surprise since I do not identify ethnically as South East Asian (if so, surprise!). On the other hand, as a physics major who is really not at all politicized, I have spent a considerable amount of time in API-progressive spaces over the last several years (for various reasons) despite having little reason to do so, and yet last week's meeting was different. \u00a0 It was different because when we were split up into small groups for an activity, two of the other students in my group were of mixed heritage. One was half Chicano, while the other was half Black. Surely this could be abnormal simply given the context of the meeting, but it was especially different for me. As someone who is mixed, I oftentimes find myself underrepresented even in communities that call for greater representation. I rarely feel that special sense that others in these spaces feel, that sense of belonging, the sense that they are part of a greater community even as they fight for more presence in greater society. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It doesn't necessarily mean I feel left out.

To counteract it, some might grasp for things to claim as API, like boba and karaoke bars. These examples are symbols of the hybrid identity that API youths experience while growing up. It\u2019s an identity that refuses to fit neatly into the labels of just \u201cAsian\/Pacific Islander\u201d or just \u201cAmerican.\u201d Neither the non-API kids in my high school nor my cousins in China knew what boba is. None of those high school peers ever associated karaoke with bars, and none of my family in China sang mainstream English songs at those karaoke bars. But the cultural symbols we create for the API community are not the only API cultural symbols we have. In a nation where discussion around race often focuses on a dichotomy of being black or being white, I never felt a sense of security in my identity as an API. In a society where growing up with a hybrid identity means you\u2019re different from those around you, and where straddling multiple nations and ideas within our ethnic identities means not fitting into any one place, developing a place of our own is a way to have a sense of home. Identifying boba as an Asian American cultural symbol means identifying boba cafes as Asian American spaces. As a result, the people, conversations, and drinks at these boba cafes then transform that space into an Asian American place. However, creating a cultural home means identifying things as culturally API against things that are not. Whenever Clara C, a famous API YouTube musician, came out with a new album or song, I would immediately identify it as API. Subconsciously, it meant Asian American artists became the standard by which I judged if a work of art is Asian American. Consequently, the newest album or song by Mariah Carey or Macklemore would not be Asian American by those standards I created. For the longest time, this is how I viewed my sense of my Asian American self. Soon enough, symbols like the Far East Movement, boba, and YouTube cover songs wove together into the cultural space by which I lived an Asian American identity I could never express in the past. Only recently did I realize that this process of Asian American placemaking, while necessary, is insufficient for explaining how I developed my Asian American cultural identity. I came into this perspective when I dwelled on how I interpreted media in different situations. With my immigrant parents who mostly consume media from mainland China, I would always share the latest movies or music from mainstream black or white artists to contrast with the Chinese movies and music they always engaged with. With my white peers in high school, I would always share Chinese cultural products that I never admitted I liked to my parents. For years, I thought I was just being a hypocrite. It never occurred to me that this seemingly contradictory behavior might actually be consistent with how my ethnic identity formed. It all goes back to that feeling of not belonging in either America or Asia. For me, counteracting that isolation meant establishing the fact that I am Asian American, and that my identity is hybrid. In the context of my home, any piece of American media I referenced, regardless of whether its producer is API, engages with my environment to symbolize the \u201cAmerican\u201d part of my Asian American identity. Similarly, even though anime and Jay Chou aren\u2019t produced by APIs, these cultural symbols of Asia emphasize the distinctly \u201cAsian\u201d part of my Asian American identity for those white peers in high school. In effect, they say, \u201cI am not fully part of you, but the other side of me is legit, too.\u201d The role they play in reinforcing the fact that my ethnic identity is hybridized means the latest Mariah Carey song or album could actually be an Asian American cultural symbol. When I saw an Asian American cultural space growing around me through YouTube cover songs and people like Yul Kwon (the winner of Survivor when teams were split by race), I set its foundation as the starting point for the cultural expression of my Asian American identity. However, that cultural expression started from the moment I set foot in America. It was evident when I told my parents Kelly Clarkson sound just as good as Liu Huan and when I told my peers that Wang Lee Hom would look better in a boy band than Justin Timberlake. Which is true. Also, my cultural symbols aren\u2019t just limited to boba or AIM usernames with AzN in them. Wang Lee Hom and Kelly Clarkson count, too, because of the context in which they appear and how they further articulate my hybridized API identity. Knowing this gave a more accurate picture of what being API meant for me and a more nuanced perspective of what that identity means on a cultural level. It really goes to show how songs, movies, books, and so forth can be racialized differently when they are placed in different racial contexts. More importantly, it showed how my Asian American identity still had space for expression even when an Asian American space did not yet exist. <\/div>\n","html":"<div title=\"Page 3\">\r\n\r\nA reflection on how the things in my life crafted and reinforced my Asian American identity\r\n\r\nby steven cong\r\n\r\nThat feeling of not belonging in either America or Asia is familiar to many Asian Pacific Islanders (APIs).

Our daily experiences and family history bound us together and in the words of a famous Asian American activist, Helen Zia, \u201cAsian Americans need to stop being so fucking polite.\u201d<\/p><p>All these years, we\u2019ve faced discrimination and oppression and we\u2019ve come a long day since then but it\u2019s the time to start speaking up.<\/p><\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 01:47:06 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 21:37:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 01:47:06 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3217,"title":"Group Spotlight: \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcPartnership For Pre-professional Pilipinos (P4)","slug":"%ef%bf%bc%ef%bf%bc%ef%bf%bc%ef%bf%bcpartnership-for-pre-professional-pilipinos","markdown":"\nby isiah regacho\n\n<div title=\"Page 3\"> Imagine yourself at an interview for a job or an internship. At that moment, there are several questions rushing through your head. Is my resume top-notch? Have I piqued the employer\u2019s interest? Have I appeared confident enough? Going through an interview can be excruciating, especially for people with no experience. Luckily, for those who feel they need help entering the professional world, P4 is there to lend a helping hand. P4 is a Haas-sponsored group whose aim is the advancement of Pilipinos in the professional world (law, business, etc.), although people of all backgrounds are welcome to join, regardless of race, gender, and so on. The members of P4 are split into two groups: partners (the senior members) and associates (the recruits). Founded back in 2001, the group aids Berkeley students by instilling them with skills needed to enter the professional world, such as how to create the perfect resume, how to ace interviews, and so on. In fact, the group is modeled after law firms and corporations, which is why the members are called associates. However, it is also a community and the members see themselves as a family, helping each other succeed. Being in P4 has been quite the experience for the newer members. According to 2nd-year Shanelle Nebre, who is in her first semester in P4, she was initially very nervous joining the group since she felt she was disconnected from the Pilipino community and the fact she came into this group as a stranger. She joined since she wanted to be part of a group that not only helped bring her back to her Pilipino roots but also shared her interest in law. In her first days in P4, she found it was all she had hoped it to be, \u201ca perfect amalgamation\u201d of people who celebrated the Pilipino culture and the world of law. As the youngest of the seven Pilipino-orgs on campus, P4 is also the smallest. According to the P4 Executive Director, 3rd-year Keizzel Camacho, this is actually an advantage. The small numbers allows the group to be more close-knit and allows the partners to give more attention to associates and make them feel more comfortable in the group. In fact, the reason why she chose to join P4 back in her freshman year was how open it was and how the group took the time to know her. In addition, P4 is more interested in retention; the group would rather have a small group of people willing to come back next semester than a large group where many of the members would drop out. P4 as a group take their time to help out in the Berkeley and Pilipino communities. According to one of the Directors of Internal Affairs, 3rd-year Richard Tallungan, P4 regularly contributes to charities and one charity that the group participates in each year is a golf tournament, where the money made would go to a charity. This year, the golf tournament will be aiding \u201cBooks for the Barrios\u201d, which packages books and supplies to low-income areas of the Philippines. Richard says that his goal is to become a resource, someone people can turn to for mentorship and guidance. Despite the group\u2019s mission being the advancement of Pilipinos in the professional world, the group is generally open to the public. Diversity is key and the group is filled with people who have majors not affiliated with law or business and people who are not Pilipino. For P4\u2019s Director of External Affairs, 3rd-year Brandon Wong (who is half-white, half-Chinese), despite recognizing that non-Pilipinos would naturally feel disincentivized from joining, he says that ultimately it does not matter what ethnicity you are since the group is so welcoming. Anyone who is interested in the professional world can join P4 and P4 is there to lend a helping hand, no matter who you are. P4 is a professional group first. During meetings, the members take their work seriously. However, outside the group, they are your average, everyday college students; Shanelle dedicates her time to volunteer work, Keizzel is a member of Cal Hawai\u2019i, Richard works for Cal Performances, and Brandon classifies himself as a \u201cpolitical junkie\u201d, regularly following current events. The partners and associates regularly hang out with each other, as both friends and associates. While professionalism does come first, in the end, the group is a family, open to all. *For those of you who are interested in joining or you want to know more about P4, follow the group on Facebook (look up \u201cPartnership for Pre-Professional Pilipinos\u201d), Twitter (@thep4life), Wordpress (calp4.wordpress.com), or Tumblr (thep4life.tumblr.com).\u00a0 *<\/div>\n","html":"by isiah regacho\r\n<div title=\"Page 3\">\r\n\r\nImagine yourself at an interview for a job or an internship.

However, with this summer\u2019s installment of *Big Brother*, it is quite hard to defend such programming. In a nutshell, *Big Brother* is a reality competition show that pits 16 Americans from across the country against each other for a $500,000 grand prize. While competing for power in the game and attempting to evade eviction, these houseguests are sequestered in a house without contact with the outside world for three months, with no idea how they are being perceived. In a context like this, it is expected that not everyone will get along, but this year\u2019s contestants took things to a whole new level. Several of the houseguests have uttered racial epithets and homophobic slurs, igniting a media firestorm that brought the controversy to national attention and triggered a discussion on the tolerance of prejudice. Aaryn Gries, the houseguest at the forefront of the controversy, lost her modeling job in real-life as a result of her comments. Some of her more infamous remarks were directed toward Korean American houseguest Helen, whom she referred to as \u201csquinty-eyed.\u201d Aaryn also told her to \u201cshut up\u2026go make some rice,\u201d and she went on a tirade mocking Asian nail salon workers. Not only are these comments derived from overplayed stereotypes, they were made in a spiteful tone meant to denigrate the API community. Coincidentally, the host of *Big Brother*, Julie Chen, is also of an Asian background and was personally offended by the remarks. She went on *The Talk *\u2013 her daytime talk show \u2013 and criticized Aaryn\u2019s comments, relating them to the insults she endured growing up. It is no laughing matter when the host chooses to remove herself from her obligation to remain objective and denounce this kind of bigotry. When Aaryn was finally evicted in late August, she was roasted by Chen and was held accountable for her behavior. Initially, she tried to deny ever making racial remarks, but Chen repeated her words back to her verbatim. Aaryn half-heartedly apologized and asserted that her comments were taken out of context. It\u2019s an excuse that doesn\u2019t really have credence, as the brunt of her racism was shown on the 24-7 live stream to the Internet to thousands of viewers. And does an apology ever just sweep all of the prejudice and discrimination under the rug? Words have been said, people have been offended, and lines have been crossed \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to just forget it all happened. Aaryn also blamed her Texan upbringing for her insensitivity and ignorance. In her attempt to apologize for her offensive words, she ended up offending yet another group of people in her generalization of Texans as bigots. (Later, she claimed that the jeers and boos from the crowd caught her off guard, hindering her from articulating her real feelings.) Even though Chen did not let Aaryn off the hook and dealt with her derogatory comments instead of saving face for CBS by ignoring them, Chen should definitely not be canonized as a saint. A few weeks following Aaryn\u2019s eviction, Chen revealed that she had gotten eyelid surgery to \u201clook less Asian,\u201d after much prompting from her boss. She was convinced that her career would never amount to anything and that she would never get the big break she needed. \u00a0\u00a0The fact that Julie Chen would get surgery to further her career adds insult to injury, because it demonstrates that Aaryn\u2019s words \u2013 and likely the attitudes of many other uninformed people \u2013 have a degree of truth to them. Her response to the racism she faced in the workplace showed her complacency; she was willing to fit with the mold instead of break free from it. The most alarming thing about this whole episode is that the houseguests made those derogatory comments fully aware they were being taped and streamed to the Internet. What else would they say behind closed doors? Ignorance still runs rampant in this country, especially in areas that aren\u2019t ethnically diverse. In particular, the lack of exposure to Asian people probably restricts their perspectives \u2013 what they know and presume about Asians is probably limited to stereotypes. Take how Aaryn feigned surprise at Helen being a political consultant rather than a manicurist as an example. \u00a0In her mind, there was no way an Asian could take on a job that requires eloquent and articulate speech. This raises the question of how tolerant we should be of racially charged jokes, particularly when they may affect the perception of an entire ethnicity. With YouTubers like Peter Chao in the spotlight, their \u201cfunky accent\u201d or \u201coverachieving Asian\u201d jokes straddle a thin line between good-natured humor and distasteful insults.

Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice, opening that Pandora\u2019s Box. I could have never met her, never let her teach me about the ugly side. Maybe it would have been better that way, because ignorance is bliss. There would have been no pain, no suffering, no self-doubt, and no realization that the world is still a messed up place filled with messed up people.

For the first time in my life, others treated me as a thing rather than a person. You didn\u2019t recognize my humanity, only my ethnicity.

I held my tongue because I had to be around all of you 24\/7 for a month, but that limitation no longer holds true. So let me share some of the thoughts I kept to myself. Ahem. Fuck you for mocking my culture. Fuck you for asking me stupid questions that you knew were offensive and fuck you for making me feel like a sideshow act rather than an actual human being. It feels so good to get that off my chest. I never said it to any of your faces because I knew that you would never understand and you would never try to understand my words or my anger.

I could\u2019ve screamed and yelled at the top of my lungs to express my anger and hurt, but I know that would not have changed a thing. I realized all of this after telling one of you how offensive you were and you told me that you knew you were offensive, but you consciously chose to keep doing what you\u2019re doing because you didn\u2019t believe that you needed to change. You actually had the nerve to tell me that you recognized your ignorance, but you planned to keep being ignorant. At that point, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ignorance or just arrogance. You said that everyone should become more tough-skinned and take things less personally, but how can I take your constant attacks on my identity without taking it personally? Most importantly, I wanted to say something to someone specifically in the group of racists I met. To the fellow Asian American who sent me a farewell text stating that you usually didn\u2019t like Asians but I was the exception, I know you meant this as a compliment, but your internalized racism shocked me. You implied that it was a negative thing to be who we are. I am honestly your anti-thesis. I love being Asian American. I take pride in my heritage and culture because that has shaped who I am today and I do not automatically dislike others based on their ethnicity or race. It saddened me that you felt this level of dislike toward our community, but it showed me that racism is not only a white-on-people of color issue. Even though you chose to separate yourself from our community, I still consider you a member of my community because you are. Regardless of how much you may dislike Asians, you are still an Asian American. In the same way that you imposed this idea of who an Asian American \u201cshould\u201d be, others will do the same to you because of your Asian appearance. I hope you realize one day that how you perceive others does not actually reflect who they are and that you learn to withhold judgment on another person until you actually get to know them. I don\u2019t know your stories. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been through in life, and I don\u2019t know you enough to make any judgments about you based on our limited interactions, even if you did not extend the same courtesy to me. While I treat my lack of knowledge about you as a fact, you reacted to your lack of knowledge about me by filling this empty space with unreasonable, archaic and misguided notions of my identity based on my ethnicity. After experiencing this type of treatment, I know how harmful it can be to an individual\u2019s sense of identity. Luckily, I came out of this experience still proud of my Asian American identity because I already had a strong identification with this part of my identity. At the same time, I can understand how others would internalize these interactions as reasons to feel ashamed of their ethnic identity. I don\u2019t expect an apology from any of you. I doubt any of you will read this, but I hope those who read this reflect on how they treat others and the potentially negative effects it will have on their well-being.

We can choose to treat others based on their actual being rather than on these contrived notions that we, as a society, have created and forced upon others.

The occurrence becomes so inevitable that one eventually turns into a token of the other. What most people fail to realize as they don their \u201cOriental Delight\u201d or their \u201cDragon Mistress\u201d is the effect that these costumes have on the people they intend to represent. And, when it comes to the aforementioned costumes of Asian women (which do exist, by the way), these people choose to turn a blind eye to the ways that they affect Asian American women and the Western perception of them. Where were these stereotypes developed? For many, the stereotypical Asian woman has long been accepted as quiet, demure, shy, and exotic. These traits, however, stem from the long developed roots of orientalism and colonialism between the Western world and Asia. The Orient, which is now regarded as an antiquated term stirring up sentiments of racial discrimination, painted a picture of exotic locations and equally exotic women. Conquering Asia became a priority for the West as an attempt to spread their influence over these new lands. Conquering Asia meant conquering its women. This occurred in two ways: the widespread sexual violence displayed towards women which was typically involved in colonialism, and the validation of the \u201csuperior traits\u201d assumed of Asian women through literature and art. Colonialism relegated Asian women to property which colonizers desired. This created the image of desire for the sexual conquest and exotification of these women which lingers in the perceptions of Asian women today. Indeed, the Asian fetish we know today can be traced back to this desirability of these women as prizes of conquest. The rest exists in the early works of media which portrayed Asian women. Travel journals, plays, and novels praised the desirable qualities that their various writers, who were usually white men, perceived to exist in Asian women. Amongst these traits, the most prevalent were those which mentioned submissiveness and sexual abilities, especially in comparison to Western women. These stereotypes pressed on over the years and continue to exist today. This combination of colonialism and orientalism has led to racist Halloween costumes. The geisha girls and China dolls of the costumes department play upon the stereotypes long set in place by history. Short skirts, deep necklines, and exposing cut outs characterize these outfits as they attempt to imitate what people perceive to be the traditional garb of the general blur that is the \u201cFar East.\u201d\u00a0 By immersing completely into these stereotypes, these costumes aid the perpetuation of the misconceptions of what it means to be an Asian American woman, thereby damaging the perception of women who are indeed Asian and not simply donning an inaccurate costume for a few hours. The image of the submissive and hypersexualized woman exists in part through the continued use of these costumes, and their return every Halloween encourages the normalization of this form of casual racism. Stereotypical costumes restrict Asian women into conforming to one of two categories; they can either be the submissive, objectified doll who bends to a suppressor\u2019s every will, or they can be the sexual, untrustworthy dragon lady. Asian American women represent neither category, of course, as these representations present not only inaccurate descriptions but also outdated ones. These expectations placed upon Asian women have existed ever since the West discovered Asia, and yet they have barely budged from their original incarnations. Racist Halloween costumes do nothing to aid in the removal of these perceptions; instead, they do quite the opposite. Keeping these costumes around essentially keeps these negative perceptions around as well. While the existence of the outfits themselves present problematic implications, the ways that companies model them also proposes negative effects on Asian American women. Without a doubt, these costumes appear more likely, if not nearly always, on Caucasian models; very rarely, if ever, will an Asian woman appear modeling them. By imposing these appearances on what is generally perceived as the Western standard of beauty, these costumes bring a sense of distance from the \u201cexotic Asian,\u201d instead taking it to a platform which is more easily deemed acceptable and desirable by the masses. This creates a culture which is palatable to Americans while also dehumanizing Asian women into objects. In a sense, these costumes impose what are seen as desirable traits onto Caucasian women. Additionally, these models always express one of two things: shyness or sexuality. The way that companies choose to represent these outfits perpetuates these ideals of stereotypical traits and associations of the submissive, hypersexual Asian woman. Even the names of these costumes prove problematic. By using such labels as \u201cdoll,\u201d \u201csexy,\u201d and \u201cmistress,\u201d Asian women become objectified and dehumanized; no longer individuals, the perceptions of them degenerate into merely objects for the use of others. The decision to label geishas as girls rather than women reveals the infantilization involved in racial conceptions of Asians. The outdated and racially charged term \u201coriental\u201d attaches itself to many costume titles as well, such as \u201cOriental Delight\u201d and \u201cOriental Princess,\u201d both of which paint Asian women as exotic and sensual objects to obtain. Asian costumes certainly don\u2019t appear to be going anywhere any time soon, and they will therefore continue to damage the image and perceptions of Asian American women. With every Geisha Girl costume which is created, with every Caucasian model that shyly casts her gaze downwards, and with every outfit which butchers some vague resemblance of an actual traditional costume, Asian American women continue to struggle even harder to fight the stereotypes displayed before them. An end to these costumes means an end to another means of pushing these negative misconceptions, and the only way to stop them is to stop it as it\u2019s happening. So, the next time that blind eye turns away from the racist displays before it, turn the other direction and call them out. <\/div>\n","html":"by patricia williams\r\n<div title=\"Page 7\">\r\n\r\nWith autumn comes the annual tidings of Halloween and everything that it entails: candy, late nights, themed parties, and, without fail, racist costumes.

It was where I could get cheap goods and great food, but I always thought that the lanterns, pagoda architecture, and dragon statues were a bit dramatic, maybe even tacky. However, I finally understood the cultural significance of Chinatown after becoming involved with the Chinese American Museum two summers ago. Chinatown was never meant to be a place of tourism; it just happened to end up that way. In 1849, the first wave of Chinese immigrants entered the West Coast. These predominantly male immigrants intended to strike it rich with gold, and then leave immediately. The Chinese men who were contracted to work on the Transcontinental Railroad had the same goals in mind. Chinatown sprung up to provide goods and services that were tailored to this community of laborers and former gold miners. For most Chinese immigrants, Chinatown was meant to be a temporary settlement until they could finally return to China with their dreamt-of fortunes. However, dreams of fortune came at a price\u2014discrimination and mob violence. The Chinese faced backlash from the white labor community for supposedly taking away their jobs. According to Bristol-Kagan\u2019s Harvard dissertation, the Chinese were much preferred over their white labor counterparts because the former did not unionize, were not as prone to disease from the harsh railroad environments, and worked for much lower wages. Anti-Chinese sentiment became steadily more violent, reaching its apex in the Chinese Massacre of 1871, in which 19 Chinese men and boys were killed by a white mob in Los Angeles\u2014the largest mass lynching in this country\u2019s history. Discrimination based on economic and racial factors ultimately led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first exclusionary practice that limited immigration based on nationality. These instances of discrimination slowly shifted Chinatown\u2019s purpose from being a temporary settlement to a safe haven, as it was difficult for the Chinese to trust outsiders. In an attempt to protect community members, leaders of Chinatown formed associations and de-facto gang-led police systems, according to Yong Chen\u2019s *Chinese**San Francisco*. From here on, Chinatown became a means of protection and survival to Chinese immigrants. Nonetheless, the existence of Chinatown has always been precarious. Whites vehemently advocated purging these communities. In 1880, LA Chinatown was demolished to make way for Union Station, forcing Chinese residents to move elsewhere. Similarly, SF Chinatown faced the prospect of relocation after the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. The whites vehemently opposed the rebuilding of Chinatown on \u201cvaluable land next to the Financial District\u201d according to the KQED documentary *Chinatown*, and thus it was difficult to secure the resources for reconstruction. However, this opposition motivated Chinatown community leaders to strategically transform their cultural centers into tourist traps in order to make profits and consequently guarantee Chinatown's preservation. This idea was almost fail-proof because wealthy and middle-class whites were fascinated by the by Chinese \u201cexoticism.\u201d Even before the destruction of these West Coast Chinatowns, whites had actively engaged in \u201cslum tourism\u201d to experience firsthand ethnic poverty. According to Raymond Lou, other whites visited Chinatown because they wanted to buy Chinese style goods. While redeveloping these Chinatowns, Chinese community leaders used this curiosity to their advantage. The Chinatowns we see in San Francisco and Los Angeles today, with the touristy architecture and knick-knack stores, are the fruits of this strategy. Today, Chinatown has become increasingly integrated into the larger American society, while still retaining its cultural character. Events like Chinese New Year celebrations and mainstream music festivals are becoming more and more visible in Chinatown. Some argue that this integration is not beneficial. In LA Chinatown, the proposed construction of corporate chain stores threatens the community members whose livelihoods depend on sales from their shops, while new luxury apartments introduce a different generation of residents into Chinatown. These new projects may damage the cultural cohesion has tied the community together. On the other hand, some believe that these investments could \u201cinject life\u201d into Chinatown, helping it reach what LA blogger Brigham Yen calls \u201curban maturity.\u201d These opposing views clearly demonstrate the divided opinion regarding the direction in which Chinatown should be headed. My journey into Chinese American history has fostered my deep appreciation for Chinatown. I no longer see it as a tourist attraction, but a community that began as a temporary settlement and ultimately became a symbol of resistance. It strategically changed with the times to ensure its survival, and I respect Chinatown even more because of that. Chinatown empowered the Chinese to stay strong even when the larger American public saw them as unworthy of basic social and political rights. Within that flashy exterior today lies a community that welcomed their members and fought to preserve their dignity. And if you ask what I think about those tacky decorations now, I\u2019d say that they are absolutely brilliant. <\/div>\n","html":"<div title=\"Page 6\">\r\n\r\nFrom Temporary Settlement to Ethnic Enclave\r\n\r\nby melissa hu\r\n\r\nGrowing up, I had always considered Los Angeles Chinatown a tourist attraction, a place of spectatorship.

This idea was almost fail-proof because wealthy and middle-class whites were fascinated by the by Chinese \u201cexoticism.\u201d Even before the destruction of these West Coast Chinatowns, whites had actively engaged in \u201cslum tourism\u201d to experience firsthand ethnic poverty. According to Raymond Lou, other whites visited Chinatown because they wanted to buy Chinese style goods. While redeveloping these Chinatowns, Chinese community leaders used this curiosity to their advantage. The Chinatowns we see in San Francisco and Los Angeles today, with the touristy architecture and knick-knack stores, are the fruits of this strategy.\r\n\r\nToday, Chinatown has become increasingly integrated into the larger American society, while still retaining its cultural character. Events like Chinese New Year celebrations and mainstream music festivals are becoming more and more visible in Chinatown. Some argue that this integration is not beneficial. In LA Chinatown, the proposed construction of corporate chain stores threatens the community members whose livelihoods depend on sales from their shops, while new luxury apartments introduce a different generation of residents into Chinatown. These new projects may damage the cultural cohesion has tied the community together. On the other hand, some believe that these investments could \u201cinject life\u201d into Chinatown, helping it reach what LA blogger Brigham Yen calls \u201curban maturity.\u201d These opposing views clearly demonstrate the divided opinion regarding the direction in which Chinatown should be headed.\r\n\r\nMy journey into Chinese American history has fostered my deep appreciation for Chinatown. I no longer see it as a tourist attraction, but a community that began as a temporary settlement and ultimately became a symbol of resistance. It strategically changed with the times to ensure its survival, and I respect Chinatown even more because of that. Chinatown empowered the Chinese to stay strong even when the larger American public saw them as unworthy of basic social and political rights. Within that flashy exterior today lies a community that welcomed their members and fought to preserve their dignity. And if you ask what I think about those tacky decorations now, I\u2019d say that they are absolutely brilliant.\r\n\r\n<\/div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 12:04:09 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 21:38:09 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 12:04:09 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3239,"title":"5150","slug":"5150-notes-from-the-psych-ward","markdown":"\nby mark lee I am not a morning person. One Friday morning this past August will be remembered as one of the most dreadful moments of my young life. My father woke me up at 8 am with the news that police officers were waiting for me downstairs. I think both he and I were thinking the same thing: \u201cWhat crimes did you commit last night?\u201d I definitely could not remember anything because my brain usually starts running around noon. When the questions came pouring in, however, things began to piece together. \u201cYes, I have had suicidal thoughts over the past few days.\u201d \u201cYes, I have intentions of hurting myself, and I am afraid I will lose control.\u201d For my safety, the four officers standing in our living room decided it was best to take me to a psychiatric ward for further evaluation. I had to relay the information to my father in Cantonese because he does not understand English. It was difficult without knowing how to say mental health terms in that language. Then the cops handcuffed me. At first, Dad looked flustered. He scolded me for not keeping these issues within the family circle and for not listening to him enough. Everything felt awful at that moment. The four officers then took me outside to their patrol car where four other officers were waiting for me. My father asked if I was cold or hungry. I told him I was fine and that I was sure there would be food wherever I was going. Both were lies. \u201cDad, they\u2019re taking me to the hospital because they know I want to hurt myself.\u201d I do not think there is one factor that causes someone to have depression, but rather a combination of family background and life experiences. I suppose I just hit the jackpot. My parents both lived rough and unfulfilling lives in Canton, around southern China. My father barely got any schooling and mainly worked on the farm. He often mentions having to watch over cows for some reason. He often will make assumptions about the world that are completely untrue but help him make sense of things. He never got the chance to be a scholar. My mother was assigned to be a factory manager despite having school grades that showed her potential for much more. She was forced to sacrifice her individual spirit early when her parents ordered her to watch over her two younger brothers when they were at work. She never got the chance to be a kid. Their decision to marry and come to the U.S. was hugely a business agreement. Part of the agreement was to have one child only; my father\u2019s previous marriage had him raising two kids on his own, and he did not have the strength for two more. I am not a child of love, and I wonder how many Asian Americans my age share that trait. When I was born, we moved into a house in the San Francisco Bayview District, which was riddled with crime but had some of the most affordable housing in the city. The neighborhood was often desolate and gloomy, not to mention dangerous, so I did not leave home much. It was well complemented by my mom and dad\u2019s parenting styles: cold, strict, hapless, stifling, and at best, inadequate. I learned to cultivate a strong hostility for the world around me and kept to my inner thoughts, which explains why I often appear aloof. \u201cYou should never have been allowed to raise children, mom.\u201d Two of the police officers drove me to SF General Hospital at around 8:30 am. The social worker that greeted me was named Susan. She told me to hand over any electronics and personal belongings, and the cops searched my pockets once more for any dangerous items. They pulled out a few Werther\u2019s Original candy wrappers, and I almost wondered if smuggling in delicious caramel hard candies was a crime. I eventually got to talk with a counselor named Brendan a bit past noon, so basically I was awake. I told him that I had been meeting with friends the day before and sharing my feelings with them, and that my mood had improved greatly since Wednesday, which is when I had my mental collapse. We felt confident I could leave by the end of the day. According to National Asian Women\u2019s Health Organization, Asian Americans typically have the lowest utilization rates for mental health services among all racial groups. This fact rang true from my observation in the rest area, where I noticed mainly white men and women occupying the makeshift beds. The NAWHO study argues that Asian Americans often suffer from the misperception that we are a \u201cmodel,\u201d healthy minority. This stereotype presents a false picture of mental and physical health for everyone, which hinders the pursuit of education, prevention, and treatment efforts for depression in our community. Hijioka and Wong of the Asian American Psychological Association find that Asian Americans aged 18-34 have the highest rates of suicidal thoughts, intentions, and attempts compared to other age groups. It is also the second leading cause of death for those in said age group. This is indeed an issue that needs to be addressed more aggressively. In order to raise Asian American participation rates in mental health services, The Office of Minority and National Affairs (from the American Psychiatric Association) stresses the importance of improving language accessibility for people with a weak grasp of English, better establishing the connection between poor mental health and chronic disease, and increasing the presence of Asian Americans in psychological research. I listed my half-sister, Angie, as my family contact, and I got a chance to speak with her at around 4pm. \u201cIf you ever have any trouble dealing with mom and dad, just let me know, and I\u2019ll see what I can do to help them understand what you\u2019re going through.\u201d I was discharged at around 6 pm after signing a few papers. I waited along Potrero Street where I had requested my mom to pick me up. The drive home featured a lot of her long-winding lectures on how I needed to just stop thinking negative thoughts and to stay positive, as well as how suffering is inevitable and universal. Way to cheer me up, Sherry. I remember my dad smiling when he saw that I was home at last. I had no idea what to expect from my parents, but I have received mostly compassion and support for my illness since the incident. I am currently looking for a Chinese-speaking doctor that can clarify the issues I am going through with my mom and dad, but the search has not been successful. In the meantime, unfortunately, they act like the incident had never happened. I am very disappointed that they have opted to continue in silence, but I remain persistent that finding a doctor will help open communications. I am actually glad I was taken to a psych ward. It helped my family get a clearer perspective on how much I suffer due to depressive symptoms. It also allowed me to open up about my depression with relatives beyond my parents, which is a monumental step towards removing the shame I feel from hiding these feelings.\n\n\n","html":"by mark lee\r\n\r\nI am not a morning person.

It\u2019s no surprise that the controversy has reached the UC Berkeley campus. In September 2013, the Daily Californian ran an ad that targeted the Asian and Asian American community. The ad read \u201cChase Lay, M.D.: Bay Area Asian Facial Plastics & Eyelid Surgery,\u201d offering a list of procedures, one of them including \u201cAsian Eyelid Surgery.\u201d Since when did \u201cAsian Eyelid Surgery\u201d become an actual cosmetic procedure? This issue isn\u2019t whether or not Asians should have plastic surgery. I firmly believe that cosmetic surgery is a personal choice. There are many reasons as to why a person may choose to get plastic surgery and I would never invalidate that. What\u2019s wrong about this advertisement is that it targets our community. This plastic surgeon, Chase Lay, has performed \u201cover 2,000 procedures\u201d with \u201cvast experience in Asian eyelid surgery.\u201d Lay specializes in working with Asians in plastic surgery procedures. In other words, Lay specializes in an industry that commercializes the stereotype of Asians and Asian eyes. This very ad reinforces the stereotypes that our community has faced for hundreds of years and Lay profits off of this. The fact that industries like this still exist tells us that Asians and Asian Americans are still the perpetual foreigner. Even after generations of Asians in America, our faces, facial features, and our image is still unaccepted in society. This ad pushes for change, for assimilation, to look more like the Western idea of what is deemed beautiful and attractive. Tuyen Nguyen, a junior at Cal, said, \u201c I was shocked that [Lay] made a business out of race. He knew that this was an insecurity of many people\u2026 He knows it and he\u2019s exploiting it.\u201d The most sickening part of this advertisement is that it clearly targets Asian and Asian American women. Lay is profiting off the insecurities of the women in our community; the same insecurities that mainstream culture perpetuates of Asian women. What does the existence of such industries tell the Asian women? It creates a reactionary effect on Asian and Asian American women; we feel uncomfortable in our own skin because Western society\u2019s idea of beautiful does not align with the way we look. We begin to feel like we are not enough, and that it is okay to want to change our features. This desire to look different, to change the features that are deemed Asian, become normalized. There is a thriving industry for \u201cfixing\u201d the way Asians look. We feel alienated from our own bodies, culture, and identity. This is not the type of message anyone should be receiving. Instead of teaching young women to embrace and love ourselves, these industries and stereotypes teach us how to change ourselves to even begin to accept ourselves. We need to create a healthy environment for the students on this campus to accept themselves for the way that they are, regardless of how society sees certain features. The placement of this advertisement does the complete opposite. The fact that the Daily Californian ran this advertisement is unacceptable. To think that this ad went through students on this campus and nobody stopped to think \u201chey, this could be really racist\u201d makes me extremely disappointed. It\u2019s a shame that no one in the Daily Cal recognized or stood up against the cultural insensitivity, offensive potential, racial and gender targeting, stereotype reinforcing, fucked up message in this advertisement. But this was also a good reminder as to why **hardboiled** was created in the first place. The founders of **hardboiled **felt that campus publications (such as the Daily Cal) did not fairly represent the API voice. **hardboiled** exists to speak up for the API community and take action against racist issues and we are not afraid to do so. Blatantly offensive race-centered ads like this still running in our campus newspaper shows that we need an API voice. Racist industries that target and commercialize our community need to be called out. The San Francisco Chronicle recently published an article in October 2013 addressing the controversy of eyelid surgery in the Asian community. Many Asians and Asian Americans were interviewed in this article to gain a wide spectrum of opinions and thoughts on eyelid surgery and a couple of **hardboiled** editors and staff members were involved in the interviews. I was fortunate and privileged in that my quote was featured in the article. **hardboiled** was able to extend the API student voice outside of campus and into the greater API community, speaking about issues that we find important.

At the time, I subscribed to a magazine called Teen Vogue, which looks exactly like it sounds: the spoiled daughter of the fashion bible Vogue. As someone whose idea of fashion meant hand-me-downs from my mother and sister, I was mind-blown by the glossy images in Teen Vogue of skinnyass white models prancing around in overpriced clothes. At that vulnerable age, I got sucked into the world I saw in Teen Vogue, where upper middle-class white privilege made all things possible as long as you had the right dress size and money. Fast-forward to today: Asian Americans have taken ahold of the fashion industry, as both consumers and producers. You may not have heard of Phillip Lim, Anna Sui, Thakoon Panichgul, or Vera Wang, but they all make millions of dollars from their name brand runway lines that have an international following. With this meteoric rise within the industry, what does the high profile of Asian American fashion designers tell about the community? The phenomenon of Asian Americans gaining more visibility in the high fashion industry says as much about their exclusion as their success. In a business heavily built on image and creative expression, Asian Americans have been held back by stereotypes that cast them as lacking artistic ability, relegating participation to only low-wage manufacturing jobs taken by Asian laborers. For Asian American fashion designers, the pressure to pursue more \u201ctraditional\u201d careers in medicine, law, engineering, or business presents a barrier to their representation. In her 2010 book *The Beautiful Generation*, author Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu found that the majority of people she interviewed intended to have careers outside of fashion, studying anthropology or biology. For the fashion designers whose parents worked in garment manufacturing, Tu found that the designers felt \u201cpressure from parents [\u2026] to do something more \u2018practical\u2019.\u201d The generation gap between the older immigrants who labored for their family\u2019s survival and the younger fashion designers who gave up college or switched professions speaks volumes about the opportunities given by class privilege. Of course, one cannot generalize that all Asian American fashion designers came from working-class backgrounds and chose to go into fashion because of an instinctive desire to rebel. In the Asian American community, an increasing acceptance of the arts as a viable career choice has resulted in families being more supportive of designers\u2019 choice to study fashion, reported the Wall Street Journal in a 2009 feature. This has led to the rise of Asian American students at prestigious fashion schools like Parsons the New School for Design in New York, where the attendance of API students tripled in number between 1998 to 2008 according to WSJ. Learning from their parents\u2019 values of self-sufficiency and familial roots, Asian American fashion designers got their relatives involved in their businesses. Taiwan-born and Parsons-dropout Jason Wu, the designer who catapulted to fame when First Lady Michelle Obama chose his dresses for both inaugurations, started his label in 2006 with his family\u2019s financial support. The direct contribution of family members to emerging fashion designers\u2019 enterprises kept alive their entrepreneurial spirit enough for the mainstream fashion industry to recognize their work. Given this, the success of Asian American fashion designers should be attributed more to the work that they and their families put in more than the people who wear their clothes, although the fashion press fails to reflect these narratives. The growing representation of Asian American designer names such as Jason Wu depicts a hopeful future for greater acceptance of the community. With all of these up-and-coming Asian American designers making big names for themselves, presenting runway shows that draw names like Kanye West and Rihanna, their success may be interpreted as an achievement given the challenges they faced. Certainly, it shows how Asian Americans embody a hybrid identity, but entering an arena populated by white designers and critics, these designers have to cope with working within a structure that more often than not exploits Asian labor. While the success of Asian American fashion designers foretells a bright future for the building more visibility of the community in creative sectors, they also tell a story of resilience within an industry that has historically excluded them.\n\n\n","html":"What does the rise of APA fashion designers say about the changing community?\r\n\r\nby sam lai\r\n\r\nMy interest in high-end fashion began at the ripe old age of 12.

For the fashion designers whose parents worked in garment manufacturing, Tu found that the designers felt \u201cpressure from parents [\u2026] to do something more \u2018practical\u2019.\u201d The generation gap between the older immigrants who labored for their family\u2019s survival and the younger fashion designers who gave up college or switched professions speaks volumes about the opportunities given by class privilege.\r\n\r\nOf course, one cannot generalize that all Asian American fashion designers came from working-class backgrounds and chose to go into fashion because of an instinctive desire to rebel. In the Asian American community, an increasing acceptance of the arts as a viable career choice has resulted in families being more supportive of designers\u2019 choice to study fashion, reported the Wall Street Journal in a 2009 feature. This has led to the rise of Asian American students at prestigious fashion schools like Parsons the New School for Design in New York, where the attendance of API students tripled in number between 1998 to 2008 according to WSJ.\r\n\r\nLearning from their parents\u2019 values of self-sufficiency and familial roots, Asian American fashion designers got their relatives involved in their businesses. Taiwan-born and Parsons-dropout Jason Wu, the designer who catapulted to fame when First Lady Michelle Obama chose his dresses for both inaugurations, started his label in 2006 with his family\u2019s financial support. The direct contribution of family members to emerging fashion designers\u2019 enterprises kept alive their entrepreneurial spirit enough for the mainstream fashion industry to recognize their work. Given this, the success of Asian American fashion designers should be attributed more to the work that they and their families put in more than the people who wear their clothes, although the fashion press fails to reflect these narratives.\r\n\r\nThe growing representation of Asian American designer names such as Jason Wu depicts a hopeful future for greater acceptance of the community. With all of these up-and-coming Asian American designers making big names for themselves, presenting runway shows that draw names like Kanye West and Rihanna, their success may be interpreted as an achievement given the challenges they faced. Certainly, it shows how Asian Americans embody a hybrid identity, but entering an arena populated by white designers and critics, these designers have to cope with working within a structure that more often than not exploits Asian labor.\r\n\r\nWhile the success of Asian American fashion designers foretells a bright future for the building more visibility of the community in creative sectors, they also tell a story of resilience within an industry that has historically excluded them.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 14:54:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 21:38:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 14:54:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3262,"title":"Fall 2013","slug":"fall-2013","markdown":"\n[Hardboiled dinner](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/photos\/fall-2013\/hardboiled-dinner\/) [Angry Asian Man](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/photos\/fall-2013\/angry-asian-man\/) [API Community Talent Show](http:\/\/wp.me\/P25G2z-S4)\n","html":"<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/photos\/fall-2013\/hardboiled-dinner\/\">Hardboiled dinner<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/photos\/fall-2013\/angry-asian-man\/\">Angry Asian Man<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/P25G2z-S4\">API Community Talent Show<\/a>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Fri, 01 Nov 2013 22:28:58 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 04 Dec 2013 19:12:43 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 01 Nov 2013 22:28:58 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3266,"title":"Angry Asian Man","slug":"angry-asian-man","markdown":"\n[nggallery id=3]\n\n\n","html":"[nggallery id=3]","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Thu, 07 Nov 2013 23:21:16 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 07 Nov 2013 23:21:16 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 07 Nov 2013 23:21:16 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3269,"title":"Hardboiled dinner","slug":"hardboiled-dinner","markdown":"\n[nggallery id=2]\n\n\n","html":"[nggallery id=2]","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Thu, 07 Nov 2013 23:23:00 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 07 Nov 2013 23:23:00 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 07 Nov 2013 23:23:00 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3276,"title":"say NO to stereotype, Stop categorization","slug":"say-no-to-stereotype-stop-categorization","markdown":"\nThere has been a long history that Asian Americans are stereotyped as hypersexualized, passive and quiet Asian American women and feminine, hard-working, socially awkward Asian American men, and it is still the case now.

In the Multicultural Community Center, I listened to a moving speech made by Eddy Zheng, a Chinese ex-convict who has become a vocal and\u00a0well-loved activistin the Asian American community upon his release. He started his speech by asking this question, \u201cWhere did you come from and where are you going?\u201d As he asked this, I thought of my past in terms of where the Asian American identity came from and what we still need to do to push for greater acceptance of our community by the American society. I come from a family of Chinese immigrants who worked relentlessly to provide for their loved ones and to achieve their American Dream. My story is not unique. My family follows the life path of many other Asian families who come to this country with dreams of more than material belongings or wealth. I come from the blood, sweat and tears of my ancestors that I will never meet and most of whom I will never know even existed. I come from the sacrifices made by the unknown Asian and Asian Americans who have opened doors for our community in the hopes that we will finally be able to reach the American Dream that has remained elusive for so many. I come from a history long forgotten. I come from the 19<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0century Chinese railroad workers in California,\u00a0*Yick Wo v. Hopkins*, Asiatic Barred Zones, Japanese and Japanese American internment, South Asian refugees, Vincent Chin, and a slew of critical moments of the past that have been ignored in American history books. I\u00a0come from the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) struggle that led to the creation of the Ethnic Studies Department at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State University (SFSU). I come from the creation of the Asian American self-identification created by the\u00a0TWLFactivists in 1969 as a way to organize American-born Asians in order to further racial equality. I come from a society that needs Ethnic Studies departments because those who write the commonly accepted version of history have excluded the history of people of color because it is seen as un-American or unimportant to know about their struggles and their contributions in America. Where are we going? That is an important question for the Asian American community as we are undergoing a change that differentiates us from our 1969 descendants. As time has passed, the \u201cAsian American\u201d label now covers many immigrants from more diverse Asian countries and their families than pre-1969. Because of the unique history of South and Southeast Asians in America, many do not readily accept the Asian American identity as representative of their story and their concerns, especially since the socioeconomic situation for Asian Americans have been masked by the model minority myth. This makes me question why we, as a society, force them to \u201cfit\u201d into this identity and whether South and Southeast Asians should be included in the Asian American identity. In 1969, politicized Asian Americans created this term to unify our community for political purposes. Because there is limited knowledge of Asian American history and the issues we face today, many in our community do not know of the political origins of the term \u201cAsian American.\u201d Instead, we are taught by society that we are Asian American. Some may later self-identify with Asian American while others do not. Asian American has become a term that is used as a way for outsiders to categorize and label people they perceive as \u201cAsian American.\u201d It is no longer simply a term used for us to self-identify our race-ethnicity. Now, \u201cAsian American\u201d is synonymous with \u201cmodel minority,\u201d the belief that Asian Americans no longer face any form of racism and that they now are doing as well as, if not better than, whites in educational and economic terms. As \u201cAsian American\u201d became a term familiar with society and became a commonplace term used by many who do not know of its historical origins, its radical and political beginnings\u00a0are forgotten. As new progressive organizations emerge under terms other than \u201cAsian American,\u201d such as Asian Pacific Islander (API) and Asian Pacific American (APA), we need to think about whether \u201cAsian American\u201d still fits its intended political purpose. It was meant to help us\u00a0couldcome together as a community to identify the issues that we endure due to our identification as Asian American and affect the necessary change to better our circumstances and treatment in America. It implied that those who identified as \u201cAsian American\u201d could create a cohesive agenda for the entire community, but that does not seem to be happening today. As racial-ethnic groups identify themselves as LGBTQIA, Republican, Democrat, Christian, Buddhist, etc., these groups inherently have different values from their fellow organizations leading to conflicting agendas. This impedes the ability for our community to work together and to create one cohesive \u201cAsian American\u201d identity with one agenda. With Asian Americans differing in opinion about whether racism is still alive today, a notion readily accepted by 1969 Asian American activists, it begs the question of whether we can create one coherent agenda pushing for greater racial equality in America. Right now, the Asian American community needs to create an understanding about who we are, what we represent, and what we want to fight for before we can move forward and use our political power to push our agenda forward. We need to decide whether \u201cAsian American\u201d is the best term available to represent our\u00a0identity\u00a0when its political origins have been disguised by the myth of the model minority. We need to see if there are issues that we face due to our race-ethnicity that can act as a unifying force to pull our community together as it did in 1969.\n\n\n","html":"by patty chen\n\nA few weeks ago, I had the privilege of attending the welcome reception for the Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies (AAADS) Department.

He started his speech by asking this question, \u201cWhere did you come from and where are you going?\u201d As he asked this, I thought of my past in terms of where the Asian American identity came from and what we still need to do to push for greater acceptance of our community by the American society. I come from a family of Chinese immigrants who worked relentlessly to provide for their loved ones and to achieve their American Dream. My story is not unique. My family follows the life path of many other Asian families who come to this country with dreams of more than material belongings or wealth. I come from the blood, sweat and tears of my ancestors that I will never meet and most of whom I will never know even existed. I come from the sacrifices made by the unknown Asian and Asian Americans who have opened doors for our community in the hopes that we will finally be able to reach the American Dream that has remained elusive for so many. I come from a history long forgotten. I come from the 19<sup>th<\/sup>\u00a0century Chinese railroad workers in California,\u00a0*Yick Wo v. Hopkins*, Asiatic Barred Zones, Japanese and Japanese American internment, South Asian refugees, Vincent Chin, and a slew of critical moments of the past that have been ignored in American history books. I\u00a0come from the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) struggle that led to the creation of the Ethnic Studies Department at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State University (SFSU). I come from the creation of the Asian American self-identification created by the\u00a0TWLFactivists in 1969 as a way to organize American-born Asians in order to further racial equality. I come from a society that needs Ethnic Studies departments because those who write the commonly accepted version of history have excluded the history of people of color because it is seen as un-American or unimportant to know about their struggles and their contributions in America. Where are we going? That is an important question for the Asian American community as we are undergoing a change that differentiates us from our 1969 descendants. As time has passed, the \u201cAsian American\u201d label now covers many immigrants from more diverse Asian countries and their families than pre-1969. Because of the unique history of South and Southeast Asians in America, many do not readily accept the Asian American identity as representative of their story and their concerns, especially since the socioeconomic situation for Asian Americans have been masked by the model minority myth. This makes me question why we, as a society, force them to \u201cfit\u201d into this identity and whether South and Southeast Asians should be included in the Asian American identity. In 1969, politicized Asian Americans created this term to unify our community for political purposes. Because there is limited knowledge of Asian American history and the issues we face today, many in our community do not know of the political origins of the term \u201cAsian American.\u201d Instead, we are taught by society that we are Asian American. Some may later self-identify with Asian American while others do not. Asian American has become a term that is used as a way for outsiders to categorize and label people they perceive as \u201cAsian American.\u201d It is no longer simply a term used for us to self-identify our race-ethnicity. Now, \u201cAsian American\u201d is synonymous with \u201cmodel minority,\u201d the belief that Asian Americans no longer face any form of racism and that they now are doing as well as, if not better than, whites in educational and economic terms. As \u201cAsian American\u201d became a term familiar with society and became a commonplace term used by many who do not know of its historical origins, its radical and political beginnings\u00a0are forgotten. As new progressive organizations emerge under terms other than \u201cAsian American,\u201d such as Asian Pacific Islander (API) and Asian Pacific American (APA), we need to think about whether \u201cAsian American\u201d still fits its intended political purpose. It was meant to help us\u00a0couldcome together as a community to identify the issues that we endure due to our identification as Asian American and affect the necessary change to better our circumstances and treatment in America. It implied that those who identified as \u201cAsian American\u201d could create a cohesive agenda for the entire community, but that does not seem to be happening today. As racial-ethnic groups identify themselves as LGBTQIA, Republican, Democrat, Christian, Buddhist, etc., these groups inherently have different values from their fellow organizations leading to conflicting agendas. This impedes the ability for our community to work together and to create one cohesive \u201cAsian American\u201d identity with one agenda. With Asian Americans differing in opinion about whether racism is still alive today, a notion readily accepted by 1969 Asian American activists, it begs the question of whether we can create one coherent agenda pushing for greater racial equality in America. Right now, the Asian American community needs to create an understanding about who we are, what we represent, and what we want to fight for before we can move forward and use our political power to push our agenda forward. We need to decide whether \u201cAsian American\u201d is the best term available to represent our\u00a0identity\u00a0when its political origins have been disguised by the myth of the model minority.

With the passage of this proposition, affirmative action was ultimately eliminated from the UC admissions process. To express the importance of these programs in diversifying our public universities, in 2000, bridges (which then was comprised of BRRC, NARRC, PASS, Raza and REACH!) boycotted Senior Weekend, an outreach event which recruits recently admitted Cal students of diverse backgrounds. This boycott resulted in a 50% drop in the enrollment of students of color, showing the significance of these programs to communities of color. According to the Office of Planning and Analysis of UC Berkeley, APIs made up 44% of the Fall 2012 undergraduate student population.

As a kid, I was obsessed with comic strips and animated cartoons. I would check out dozens of Garfield comics from the library at a time and read them all day long. I even brought them with me to the bathroom, where I once dropped a book in the toilet, and had to frantically fish it out and dry it before all the pages were ruined.

The latest in racist news? Not quite \u2013 because the band is entirely made up of Asian Americans. The Slants, a dance-rock band from Portland, Oregon, is currently in what has been a four-year struggle with the PTO, who insist that the name is unacceptable under patent laws because of its racist undertones. Yet, members of the band argue that the intent is something altogether. In their first application in 2009, the Slants argued that it was attempting instead to reclaim this term and that the word has so many other positive meanings that the band draws from \u2013 most notably the slant as a perspective on life. As they continue their legal battle, they bring to the forefront another battle \u2013 that of reappropriation and more broadly, the Asian American struggle to define themselves and their identities. To begin with, their fight mirrors that of others before them. In 2005, Dykes on Bikes won the right to use \u201cdyke,\u201d often used as an offensive term for lesbians, as part of a greater movement to reclaim the word. Many marginalized communities over the years have rallied to reclaim slurs as their own in the attempt to defuse the power of these words. Hell, the Quakers did it 350 years ago. But what does it mean to reclaim a word? And just *who* can use these reclaimed terms? When a voter called openly gay mayor candidate Christine Quinn a dyke in front of her opponent Anthony Weiner, there was much outrage over Weiner\u2019s mild response. Yet, Quinn has co-sponsored the Dyke March as director of Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project and marched in parades alongside Dykes on Bikes. What the woman said was clearly offensive, but then how do we judge when a word is being used inoffensively? Is it intent? Or can only people in the community, as some argue, be allowed to use words that have been reclaimed? But, perhaps the most pressing debate is something even harder to answer \u2013 whether reclaiming terms are powerful at all. Many would argue that reclaiming a term defuses its power \u2013 but if people can continue to use it as an insult, as the woman did with dyke, it is less clear whether this is really true. What implications then does the Slants\u2019 battle have for the API community? Sure, what the Slants are attempted to do is far from a full-fledged political movement. But it is important. Whether it is possibly to fully reclaim a term, there is no doubt that it can be powerful. It says: \u201cWe are not afraid of what you have to throw at us.\u201d Coming from a community that has been characterized for far too long as submissive and quiet, I think the Slants\u2019 actions are pretty loud \u2013 and most of all, it\u2019s being heard. What the members are trying to do \u2013 to challenge and to reclaim slurs and stereotypes with their name \u2013 has been done before (Bert Wang and his rock-rap group SuperChink, for example). But this time, its efforts are gaining national media attention. What\u2019s more, the Slants are just so unabashedly Asian American. It is in their name, in their style (Chinatown Dance Rock, it proclaims on the website), in everything they do. In fact, more and more, Asian Americans are defying stereotypes simply by what they do \u2013 Jeremy Lin in basketball, Margaret Cho in comedy, Far East Movement in rap\u2026and the Slants in dance-rock. Eighties\u2019 dance-rock band from Portland, Oregon? Yes, still Asian American, because Asian American doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t dictate occupation or personality or appearance, and it is people like these that challenge the belief that Asian Americans are all the same. Simon Tam, who manages and plays bass for the band, admits \u2013 he was once ashamed of being Chinese American, bullied and taunted as a child for being one. His fight with the PTO is the fight to define himself and his band and to take back a word that has been thrown at children just like him to be ashamed of who they are. It is a fight about identity and the ability to shape it for oneself \u2013 in the media and in everyday life. In his presentation here at Cal, Phil Yu, the man behind Angry Asian Man, talked about a time when the number of Asians on primetime television could be counted on one hand, and just last year, **hardboiled **covered the yellow face found in the movie *Cloud Atlas*. We have seen our identity shaped by others, our representation so often misrepresentation \u2013 and it\u2019s time to reclaim our identity. The Slants claim that the name is more than just a name, but an integral part of their music and their identity. It\u2019s also a word impossible for Asian Americans to escape, our \u2018slanty\u2019 eyes a glaring feature on the Asian caricature created by society. But just as the band says, the word has so many other meanings, and we use one of them right here in **hardboiled**. Here, we encourage our writers every issue to find their slant.

Of course, being born and raised in Los Angeles exposed me to all kinds of cuisines, but in Berkeley I was struck by how many vegetarian, vegan, dairy-free, and gluten-free options there were. Eventually I became friends with folks who are vegan, and I was curious to know their experience transitioning to the lifestyle since I have been vegetarian for a year. And well, I wanted to know good places to get vegan grub. \u00a0 Vincent Yin, 4th-year Mathematics and Art Practice double major *when did you become vegan?* I fully transitioned (more or less) to veganism last September, but the journey to get there lasted several months. Even I don\u2019t fully understand exactly why or how it happened! It used to be that I was just like most other people who think, \u201cOh, I could never be vegan!\u201d\u00a0But I have been repeatedly exposed to issues at the intersection of animal rights, food justice, and environmentalism, starting way back in high school when I watched one of those sensationalist but compelling documentaries that made me quit meat for a week, to college when I finally met people who practice vegetarianism and veganism. It was just bound to happen. Honestly, though, the first real step I took was that I decided to stop buying meat at the store because I started to think that it was a real hassle. I still ate meat and other animal products outside of my own place, though, because like most people, I was unwilling to give up homemade meals cooked by my family.** \u00a0 *what drove you to practice a vegan diet\/lifestyle?* I had already been vegetarian since July, and became vegetarian\/vegan because I had the thought that meat is just dead animals and I just decided that that was strange and that I'd stop eating them... of course, I had been reading about vegetarianism casually, so it wasn't just a sudden change. Personally, I tend to think of my veganism as a form of allyship or a a process and movement away from participation in a society based in animal cruelty, rather than as simply a dogmatic position. It\u2019s one thing to say that animal products are unethical and another thing to fully internalize that position and be an ally to animals. \u00a0For example, sometimes vegans forget that the goal of reducing animal suffering goes hand-in-hand with ensuring that vegan alternatives to animal products are accessible to everyone. \u00a0 *what do you love about being vegan?* It's become a lot easier to cook food, since you don't have to worry about cross-contamination. \u00a0It took a while before I got used to cooking and eating vegan dishes, and there are sneaky animal products hidden in some things (like whey or casein) that I hadn't realized were not vegan. I know that the circumstances and privileges that allowed me to become vegan include the example set by other vegetarians and vegans I know as well as the abundance of vegan options here in Berkeley. \u00a0 *what are some difficulties? are there many vegan options available in API dishes?* Especially for Chinese food or East Asian food in general, there are a lot of vegan API dishes, and it's surprisingly easy to find vegan Vietnamese food too, although not all Vietnamese restaurants have that. Also, since most of my friends are Asian and like to eat at Asian restaurants, I\u2019ve found that at almost every place we go to, I can find something to eat, usually a tofu or vegetable stir-fry dish. \u00a0 *favorite thing to order when eating out? favorite thing to cook when home?* My favorite dish is the vegan sesame chicken from Nature Vegetarian, and at home I my favorite dish is vegan mac and cheese, although usually I just make vegetable stir fries. _________________________________________________________________________ Kelsie Morioka, 2013 alum, *when did you become vegan?* I became vegan the day I moved out, once I was able to make decisions about what I consume in terms of food. (It's been a little over four years.) *what drove you to practice a vegan diet\/lifestyle?* I am vegan because I am fortunate enough to have had the resources to learn about veganism and because I am in a place, financially and otherwise, where being vegan is affordable and healthy for me. Given my privileges and circumstances, it makes sense to me to be vegan for both environmental reasons and animal welfare reasons. *what do you love about being vegan?* I don't know what I \"love\" about it, if there's anything that I love about it. As I said, I'm vegan because it makes sense to me - it makes sense to me to continuously work on myself to live\/eat more sustainably and consume less (not only in terms of veganism)... I would be very unhappy with myself if I weren't vegan; it's not something I do because I \"love\" it. I love food and baking, if that's relevant. \u00a0 *what are some difficulties?* Eating out can be difficult sometimes, depending on the environment. By far, though, the most challenging and frustrating thing that I've encountered is the assumptions people make. Some people assume that I care more about animals than people. Some people act as though because I'm vegan, I must not be invested in other issues. It's tiring hearing the \"You're vegan, but you know, to grow your vegetables POC are exploited,\" not only because it pushes aside the fact that this is true throughout our food system (in meat production, in growing crops to feed the animals we eat, in food manufacturing, in restaurant service, etc.), but also because it helps no one to be attacking each other about whose diet is less exploitative. People assume I'm not aware of food deserts and nutritional requirements... Also, a lot of mainstream pro-vegan stuff is problematic - calling animal testing-free products \"cruelty\"-free, for example (what about the people involved in production?), PETA's sexist\/sizeist campaign ads, etc. *are there many vegan options available in API dishes?* (I don't know if this was intentionally put on the same line as 'what are some difficulties' but I separated them...) Uhm? I'm not familiar enough with any specific API cuisine to be able to say... I eat Indian and Thai food the most, and it's easy in Berkeley to find amazingly delicious vegan options... elsewhere maybe not so much. \u00a0 *favorite vegan dish?* Currently it's lasagna, made with tofu \"ricotta\" and lots of veggies... and saag dal... and French fries.\n\n\n","html":"by sam lai\r\n\r\n*Veganism is a type of vegetarian diet that excludes meat, dairy products, and all other animal-derived products.

I would be very unhappy with myself if I weren't vegan; it's not something I do because I \"love\" it.\r\n\r\nI love food and baking, if that's relevant.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<i>what are some difficulties?<\/i>\r\n\r\nEating out can be difficult sometimes, depending on the environment. By far, though, the most challenging and frustrating thing that I've encountered is the assumptions people make. Some people assume that I care more about animals than people. Some people act as though because I'm vegan, I must not be invested in other issues. It's tiring hearing the \"You're vegan, but you know, to grow your vegetables POC are exploited,\" not only because it pushes aside the fact that this is true throughout our food system (in meat production, in growing crops to feed the animals we eat, in food manufacturing, in restaurant service, etc.), but also because it helps no one to be attacking each other about whose diet is less exploitative. People assume I'm not aware of food deserts and nutritional requirements... Also, a lot of mainstream pro-vegan stuff is problematic - calling animal testing-free products \"cruelty\"-free, for example (what about the people involved in production?), PETA's sexist\/sizeist campaign ads, etc.\r\n\r\n<i>are there many vegan options available in API dishes?<\/i>\r\n\r\n(I don't know if this was intentionally put on the same line as 'what are some difficulties' but I separated them...)\r\n\r\nUhm? I'm not familiar enough with any specific API cuisine to be able to say... I eat Indian and Thai food the most, and it's easy in Berkeley to find amazingly delicious vegan options... elsewhere maybe not so much.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<i>favorite vegan dish?<\/i>\r\n\r\nCurrently it's lasagna, made with tofu \"ricotta\" and lots of veggies... and saag dal... and French fries.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 22:12:42 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 22:12:42 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 24 Nov 2013 22:12:42 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3320,"title":"\"Asian\" Mushroom Soup","slug":"asian-mushroom-soup","markdown":"\nby clarabelle cheng-yue Last flu season, I decided to visit my friends, Anastasia and Veronica, for my weekly round of freeloading. As I patiently waited for my opportunity on their couch, I was told Anastasia\u2019s boyfriend had, on the previous night, graciously brought over what he called \u201cAsian mushroom soup\u201d to help ease Anastasia\u2019s \u00a0suffering from a very bad cold. Veronica chuckled at the retelling of the story. When the soup was brought out, Veronica let out another laugh.\u00a0 I smiled at my two friends, and they knew what I wanted. I excitedly grabbed a ladle and started filling my bowl with the soup. After the expected amount of time for an average person to lose interest in soup had passed, I noticed Veronica was still directing her smile back at me \u2013 a very wry smile. My ladle-ing slowed, and I became suspicious of what I was about to eat. I inspected the contents: Shiitake mushrooms, snow peas, and round rice-like things bobbing in reddish-brown broth. \u201cIs something wrong with the soup?\u201d I asked my creepy friend. Following a dramatic pause, she spews \u201cIt\u2019s not Asian!\u201d while, lifting her arms in amused frustration. She was right. Some of the ingredients were not of Asian origin, and, by Asian culinary standards, the Shiitake mushrooms, snow peas, broth, and the \u201crice\u201d were prepared incorrectly. I found myself gnawing through woody mushroom stems, spitting out inedible pea pod fibers, choking on the excessively briny soup, and thinking \u201cSHIIT-ake mushrooms! American ignorance is not bliss!\u201d No restaurant in all of Asia would serve a dish called \u201cAsian Mushroom soup.\u201d Why would they? It would be like denoting one\u2019s actions by ethnicity. Imagine Sally, a girl of Asian descent, skipping down a sidewalk. We would not describe the skipping as \u201cAsian.\u201d Sally has Asian components, but she does not precisely skip in an *Asian* way. A more accurate description would be that she skips *Sally\u2019s* way. On the same note, the soup self-proclaims that it\u2019s Asian, but fails to recognize its more proper name. It simply *is* a Shiitake mushroom soup. There is no need to tout its regional background. The discrepancy between what\u2019s perceived as the bona fide version of ethnic food and what\u2019s actually the Americanized derivative drives the successful commercialization of Americanized Asian ethnic food. The hiccup in understanding what traits translate to true Asian qualities stems from limited exposure to multicultural groups and scarce opportunities to learn about them. With all its diversity, Asia\u2019s regions continue to be inequitably represented in the States by the misrepresentation of their unique histories in the US, domestic media coverage, and, insidiously, food. Fast food chains are the most frequent and widespread culprits of selling \u201cassimilated\u201d food. Chinese fast food restaurants that dapple the States usually serve orange chicken, Beijing beef, and teriyaki coated, no, drowning in some sweet and sour sauce, none of which would be served in the same likeness in an authentic Chinese restaurant. Meat is rarely fried in traditional Chinese food and is frequently served in soups or stir-fry, accompanied by a healthy amount of vegetables. Oh, one more thing: teriyaki is Japanese. Get it right, Panda Express! Not only does American Asian fast food give the wrong impression of Asian cuisine, typical Chinese take-out restaurants in the US serve food that misrepresent traditional dishes. Dinner from Chinatown would predominantly showcase Cantonese dishes that have adopted American ingredients and styles of cooking to cater to American tastes. Moreover, MSG-riddled take-out from a Chinese restaurant would be considered fast food in China. Preparation of traditional food in China is more complex, utilizing special techniques and cookware that bring out subtleties Americanized foods lack. I am not saying all ethnic restaurants should start purchasing special ovens from overseas. That would be unreasonable. However, there exist dishes that don\u2019t require special techniques and stay true to its traditional form. It is true many of today\u2019s ethnic dishes are derived from its authentic counterpart, but by condoning the act of replacing traditional ingredients with ones readily available in America, we are losing cross-cultural ties that promote understanding amongst all groups in America. Perhaps it is commonplace for people to amalgamate ethnic groups into one because as long as it tastes good, keeps our wallets full, and quick to pack and go, we are content. But what will happen when our tasty Americanized food overshadows ethnic food and distorts how ethnic groups are perceived within our country as well as how Americans are perceived outside of our country? Stereotypes and racial slurs related to food have accumulated over decades of insularity. Fortune cookies are undeniably associated with the Chinese, but they are hardly served in China. \u201c Curry-Muncher\u201d is a derogatory term directed solely towards Indians even though curry is a traditional dish in many countries outside of India. These unfounded generalizations give the U.S. a bad name. A quick search on the web for how foreigners think of Americans would yield words such as \u201cstuck up,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cignorant,\u201d and \u201chate the rest of the world,\u201d all of which resonate with how our ethnic food is treated. A good portion of America is missing out on how Vietnamese dishes make use of their versatile *b\u00e1nh***, how people of Turkey love their meat, how the interplay of Thai spices contrasts with that of Indian spices, and how food culture cultivates a world of cultural acceptance.****A friend of mine from Singapore told me how food brings people of all backgrounds together and initiates the exchange of cultural awareness amongst them: \u201c**[Food] is a way of life. The most common conversation topic and the easiest to broach and what can often define friendships\u201d. Much like the United States, Singapore is culturally diverse. Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese folk all intermingle and eat food originating from their neighbor\u2019s homeland, yet the majority of these people are not confused about where their meals\u2019 influences correspond to which nations. I asked my friend \u201cDoes SG [Singapore] have racial discrimination issues? As big as the U.S.?\u201d She confidently responds with \u201cNope. They do exist, in some form or the other, but not bad like in the U.S.\u201d It may be that because Singapore is much smaller than the U.S., dissemination of information across the country is more manageable. Nevertheless, it is difficult to deny that social ties with food bring seemingly disparate groups closer together. The melting pot was a metaphor conceived in the 1780s in order to describe the assimilation of immigrants into a common culture. Overtime, the thought of losing our roots was unpalatable, so by the 1980s, the metaphor of the U.S. was changed to the salad bowl to celebrate the individuality of each cultural group. So why are many Americans still culturally illiterate? Perhaps it\u2019s the unwavering preference for the taste of Americanized food or the need to save a buck. Whatever the reason, I hope people will, whether it is once every ten years or three times a day, take the opportunity to go grab a bite at an unfamiliar ethnic restaurant and at least think about why the food is unique.\n\n\n","html":"by clarabelle cheng-yue\r\n\r\nLast flu season, I decided to visit my friends, Anastasia and Veronica, for my weekly round of freeloading.

The newer umbrella phrases, such as Asian Pacific American or Asian\/Pacific Islander, attempt to be more inclusive of a wide range of ethnicities and subcultures. However, as the migration of Asian communities becomes more complex, these labels do not reflect the scope of all our experiences.

There are many ways I identify with and appreciate our collective API identity. I find that ultimately our individual experiences help us understand it better, so let me share with you my story. I was born in Maryland and I grew up in California. During the middle of my junior high years, my parents decided to move our family overseas to Taiwan, a beautiful island east of China and nestled between Japan and the Philippines. But it wasn\u2019t as simple as trading hot dogs and fries for beef noodle soup and stinky tofu. No, it was physically leaving my childhood friends, home church, and the 5-1-0 suburbs for an entirely different environment, culture, and community of people. Sure, I knew the languages and had a fascination for the culture; I wished I could spend more time there during each visit. But those were the sentiments of an adventurous young girl who enjoyed (amazing) food-filled summer vacations with relatives overseas. To live there for five years, receive my bilingual education there, and be exposed to more Mandarin and Taiwanese than I did to English every moment \u2013 that was tough. This move seven years ago changed my definition of home, my worldview, and my perception of what it means to be an Asian American. I learned to adapt, albeit painfully slow. My new school in Taiwan was a private international school that followed an American curriculum, so I didn\u2019t suffer too much at first. I just wasn\u2019t used to the highly competitive and stressful academic environment in which many students sought to take Honors, AP, and IB classes. Seeking academic success was the norm, and having multiple tutors for multiple subjects was common. For 95% of my peers, summer meant taking a course from the Princeton Review in preparation for the SAT. Outside of school, it was always fun to speak near-perfect English in front of Taiwanese locals, who often looked up and stared at this group of \u201cTaiwanese Americans\u201d conversing in a loud, flamboyant manner. We were typical American foreigners; \u201cwai guo ren,\u201d they would call us. And so we were. We were as American as we could be on the small island of Taiwan, staying closely connected to American pop culture through social media, friends, our school\u2019s student body events and American administrators and staff. We had prom, winter formals, a cheerleading club; we granted Valedictorian and Salutatorian status upon graduation. Our laptops blasted songs by Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. While I was physically immersed into Taiwanese culture, I was still able to maintain my American identity; as far as everyone in Taiwan was concerned, I was an American. For this reason, when I came back to the States for college, I was not prepared to feel like an outsider. It was hard to pinpoint the reason for this; all I knew was that the country where I spent the majority of my childhood became rather foreign the moment I landed at SFO. To me, it didn\u2019t matter that I spoke the language and knew the street signs, the nitty-gritties, or the ins-and-outs of the area \u2013 something was missing and left me half-empty. I longed to express myself by alternating between languages and be fully understood, to have those annoyingly lively family reunions with relatives back in Taiwan and be fed like no other. I wanted my Eastern and Western worlds to fuse. I realized that during those years spent in Taiwan, I was shaped into a product of cultural hybridity, making it hard for me to identify as fully Taiwanese or American. It was the lack of the cultural mixing here in the States that left me feeling rather empty. Despite all of my efforts to \u201cAmericanize myself\u201d when I was in Taiwan, to be different, to stand out and maintain that American side of me, I neglected to love the emerging Taiwanese girl inside. Regardless of how others label me, whether Asian American, American Asian, Taiwanese American, American-born-Chinese\/Taiwanese, Third Culture Kid, or Banana, I am grateful to be blessed with two cultures.

I was one of a few Asians at a high school that was predominantly Latino and white, a splash of yellow amongst the racial majority canvas. I grew up fully aware that an Asian-centric culture was missing from my life, as Southern California politics engaged more on Latino issues and largely ignored Asians. I had no idea what it meant to be part of an Asian-oriented identity nor had my environment provided a reason to give a damn about it. \u200bIn transitioning from high school to college, I experienced a massive culture shock. The student body of Cal contains every API identity imaginable. For many this is completely normal, a mere duplication of their previous community. For those like me, I was dumbstruck by the fact not only this many Asians existed, but they are all in my generation. \u200bPerhaps that shock was too much for me my freshman year. I was reluctant to venture too far out of my comfort zone, and I meekly focused on my classes and tried to find that magical major that would land me a career. I was braver my second year at Cal and ventured to join a club. As I walked down the many tables of Calapalooza, I noticed a yellow banner that promoted Asian American journalism. That was when I was handed my first issue of **hardboiled**. \u200bIt was transformative. From the beautifully hand-drawn cover, to the passionately writen articles of Asian American student politics, I knew I had to join this club. All my life I had only seen myself as a minority without a cause. After joining, I became a writer that engaged with several student groups and obliterated my comfort zone as I was constantly exposed to new communities. \u200bBecoming a part of **hardboiled** taught me an important distinction. There is a difference between knowing your identity and caring about your identity. My local community had only gone so far as to differentiate me from the prevailing racial majorities, but never educated me on the struggles, the political causes or history of my own ethnic category. \u200bSure, I had a layman\u2019s understanding of the model minority myth, but there\u2019s so much more. Gender and sexuality is hardly discussed, except as jokes on the emasculation of API men, or the temptress API women. In schools, we are pointdexters expected to have a penchant for math and science and are ridiculed if we don\u2019t meet those expectations. From the Free Speech Movement to the LA riots, Asian Americans have had a place in history, but for me no space existed where I could engage in these topics safely. In high school, all I experienced was racist insults hurled at my expense, with no one around that could empathize. \u200bIt was through **hardboiled** that my eyes had become opened.

I was one of a few Asians at a high school that was predominantly Latino and white, a splash of yellow amongst the racial majority canvas. I grew up fully aware that an Asian-centric culture was missing from my life, as Southern California politics engaged more on Latino issues and largely ignored Asians. I had no idea what it meant to be part of an Asian-oriented identity nor had my environment provided a reason to give a damn about it.\r\n\r\n\u200bIn transitioning from high school to college, I experienced a massive culture shock. The student body of Cal contains every API identity imaginable. For many this is completely normal, a mere duplication of their previous community. For those like me, I was dumbstruck by the fact not only this many Asians existed, but they are all in my generation.\r\n\r\n\u200bPerhaps that shock was too much for me my freshman year. I was reluctant to venture too far out of my comfort zone, and I meekly focused on my classes and tried to find that magical major that would land me a career. I was braver my second year at Cal and ventured to join a club. As I walked down the many tables of Calapalooza, I noticed a yellow banner that promoted Asian American journalism. That was when I was handed my first issue of <b>hardboiled<\/b>.\r\n\r\n\u200bIt was transformative. From the beautifully hand-drawn cover, to the passionately writen articles of Asian American student politics, I knew I had to join this club. All my life I had only seen myself as a minority without a cause. After joining, I became a writer that engaged with several student groups and obliterated my comfort zone as I was constantly exposed to new communities.\r\n\r\n\u200bBecoming a part of <b>hardboiled<\/b> taught me an important distinction. There is a difference between knowing your identity and caring about your identity. My local community had only gone so far as to differentiate me from the prevailing racial majorities, but never educated me on the struggles, the political causes or history of my own ethnic category.\r\n\r\n\u200bSure, I had a layman\u2019s understanding of the model minority myth, but there\u2019s so much more. Gender and sexuality is hardly discussed, except as jokes on the emasculation of API men, or the temptress API women. In schools, we are pointdexters expected to have a penchant for math and science and are ridiculed if we don\u2019t meet those expectations. From the Free Speech Movement to the LA riots, Asian Americans have had a place in history, but for me no space existed where I could engage in these topics safely. In high school, all I experienced was racist insults hurled at my expense, with no one around that could empathize.\r\n\r\n\u200bIt was through <b>hardboiled<\/b> that my eyes had become opened. I now saw myself as more than just a minority. I was an Asian American with a history of discrimination none had cared to inform me of before. I was now constantly in dialogue about issues of model minority myths, hate crimes against Asian Americans, mass media stereotypes and racism that I could never have learned from my bubbled suburbia.

Certainly there have been recent political advances in acknowledging the equal rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in marriage and workplace safety. The growing queer movement within the API community has pushed issues like HIV\/AIDS, drug abuse, sexual violence, and homelessness to the forefront, but much work needs to be done. Within queer API spaces, understandings of gender identity, expression, and sexuality still remain an issue. With this issue of hardboiled coming out after Transgender Awareness Week (from November 11 to 17), the API community needs to recognize the ways in which it perpetuates transphobia within its own ranks and work towards building safe spaces for all identities. Understanding the \u201cT\u201d in \u201cLGBT\u201d means understanding the difference between sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, and attraction, not at all an easy thing to do or explain. According to GLAAD, the national LGBT media advocacy organization, \u201ctransgender\u201d serves as \u201can umbrella term for individuals whose gender identity differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth.\u201d The term has commonly been shortened to trans*, with the asterisk denoting that there are many other identities that follow, such as gender non-conforming, genderqueer, non-binary, agender, and genderfuck. Also on the spectrum of gender identity, \u201ccisgender\u201d refers to one whose identity and expression aligns with what society considers appropriate for their birth-assigned sex. The application of either trans* or cis goes against the idea that by default everyone\u2019s gender has to match with their birth-assigned sex. By acknowledging one\u2019s identity as cis-man or cis-woman, individuals recognize the privilege of having their gender identity read correctly, more or less. For trans* API folks, all too often others will assume their gender identity for them, using incorrect gender pronouns or asking invasive questions. For Jayden Thai, a trans* Vietnamese American and the founder of the transAPIvoices channel on YouTube, carving a safe space for himself meant starting from scratch. On a guest post for the Visibility Project, Jayden\u00a0shared, \u201cBecause I was born and raised in Kentucky, it was challenging to find people or resources in my community. Even searching online with an abundance of resources for trans folks, it was challenging to find information on being Asian and trans. I felt very isolated. I realized that I could continue looking for a role model or I can be that role model just by putting myself out there. What better way than through YouTube. So, I asked a few of friends that I knew felt similarly, and transAPIvoices was created.\u201d A society in which being cisgender is a privilege also reinforces sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. All of these forces of oppression stigmatize those whose identities deviate from the norm, dehumanizing them and barring them from access to social services, healthcare, and political participation. Here at UC Berkeley, we enjoy the reputation of being one of the \u201cTop 10 Colleges With Pride & No Prejudice,\u201d according to Huffington Post (contributed by Unigo College Rankings). Yes, we may seem all rainbows and ponies compared to other campuses, and yes the Bay Area is home to a thriving LGBTQ community, but the stories of success cover up the ones of survival, especially for trans* APIs. While data on trans* APIs is scarce, recent statistics on are grim: the 2011 report \u201cInjustice At Every Turn\u201d found that 18% of API transgender and gender non- conforming people report a household income of less than $10,000 a year, which entails conditions of extreme poverty. Concerning education, of the API respondents who attended K-12 institutions and expressed transgender identity or gender non-conformity, 65% faced harassment, 39% physical assault, and 19% sexual assault. What these statistics look like for our campus remains to be seen, and every API trans* person experiences different struggles, but to say that UC Berkeley is a safe space for trans* APIs depends on the context. A trans* friend shared with me how despite being in spaces intended for trans*-identified individuals and their allies, there wasn\u2019t any one space where they felt recognized for all of their intersectionalities: queer, trans*, person of color. There\u2019s the student level, where groups like Queer Straight Alliance, Cal Queer & Asian, Trans*Action, and T-Cal form safe spaces for individuals to share stories and engage in community- building through events and conferences. There\u2019s the institutional level, making restrooms gender-neutral, gender- inclusive housing, and allowing preferred names on IDs (though this has yet to be fully implemented). But none of these can prevent the daily assault of one\u2019s gender identity or expression being misread or the threat of hate crimes. Trans* identity constitutes more than just the individual\u2019s sense of their gender: media and the people around them also help shape their definition of self as a whole. The same gender roles and expectations placed on cisgender Asian Americans affect trans* Asian Americans as well, but to different extents. Current Cal student J shared how their relationship with their brother has impacted their identity formation. \u201cMy transition, I guess hormonally, and [in terms of] my realization of myself, happened from interactions with my brother, cuz he\u2019s been the only one in my family who has accepted me, though he\u2019s sometimes irritating as little brothers go.\u201d For trans* APIs, the forces of oppression in the classroom, home, or public compounds to the pressure to assimilate to whiteness. For trans* APIs, this means the unshakeable feeling of being unwelcome in queer spaces, Asian American spaces, and even queer Asian American spaces. The intersection of racial stereotypes and gender expectations becomes very real for trans* APIs because of how their presence is marginalized. Recognizing the struggles that trans, genderqueer, and non-binary gender people of color means neither victimizing nor tokenizing them: it means that cisgender APIs can do more to challenge gender norms and respect identities. This starts by first asking basic questions: \u201cHow do you identify? What gender pronouns do you use?\u201d The exchange shouldn\u2019t be one-sided simply because one person is aware that the other person may be trans*: it should be an open dialogue regardless of how many trans* people are in the room or not. One of my favorite quotes comes from someone who doesn\u2019t identify as API, but who I still look up to: Lynn Riordan, a Bay Area trans activist whom I met at the Berkeley Pride celebration this past summer. In her speech, Riordan shared, \u201cIt\u2019s best to stop trying to figure out trans people, it\u2019s best to let that go, and just accept people for who they are.\u201d For cisgender API folks, let\u2019s stop figuring out our trans* community members, and start figuring out ways to fight transphobia and build allyship.\n","html":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">complicating the \u201cT\u201d in LGBT for APIs<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">by sam lai<\/p>\r\nI\u2019m like an observer looking at myself not being my true self,\r\nthrough a window, hiding the truth behind a mask\r\nreflecting who I am, who I want to be that reflects people\u2019s opinions of me\r\n\r\nLooking for answers wanting to be me\r\nwithout removing my mask\r\nthrough a mirror and let people look at the shrouding\r\nseeing light and shadows across my face shadows across my face\r\nhiding my uncertainty, unable to be me\r\nwondering if I\u2019m really myself to be my true self\r\nor, if I am a clone created by someone without the fear of opening up,\r\nthrough overcoming my self-doubt\r\npeer pressure comfortable, with my identity\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">- being me by j<\/p>\r\nUnderstanding gender and sexuality in the Asian Pacific Islander community often means a \u201cman versus woman\u201d or \u201cstraight versus gay\u201d comparison, but these binaries fail to acknowledge the many identities that exist outside of it.

The Hmong left behind generations of families and their traditions and cultures when immigrating to the states. Thus the Hmong elders, younger generations, and spiritual culture of the Hmong people began their adaptation to the American culture. Upon their arrival in America, the Hmong people were challenged by the popular American culture. Many Hmong families exchanged their shamanism culture for the faith of God; Hmong youths became delinquents to their parents as American culture highly influenced them away from following the Hmong traditions. Belonging to an ethnicity with no country, no flag, no national song, no government, the Hmong people adapted but most importantly, persevered. A great example of this perseverance exists on the face of Cal. Here at this large institution, the Hmong Student Association at Berkeley (HSAB) was established in the spring of 2008 to create a family or place for the Hmong\/ Hmong American students. Not only was HSAB created for the Hmong students at Cal, but it was created to promote higher education in the greater Hmong community. Higher education has been a struggling topic within the Hmong community. Many Hmong youths face financial pressure or lack of support and encouragement from their families and environments, some factors which prevent them from pursuing higher education. Being aware of these common issues, HSAB has given and continues to give back to their community, whether it is back home or at Cal. Thus in 2008, HSAB created a program called the Pursuit of Higher Education (PoHE), which engaged Hmong high school students with higher education at UC Berkeley. Pursuit of Higher Education (PoHE) is a three day, all-expense paid program held at UC Berkeley in the spring, catering to Hmong students of all backgrounds from Northern and Central California. This educational program includes workshops that teach Hmong high school students about Hmong history and culture and about higher education. The coordinators and mentors of PoHE also engage with these high school students through bonding activities, creating a safe space for the Hmong youth. King Xiong is a third year undergraduate student of Cal and the Operations Coordinator and Outreach Coordinator of HSAB. He volunteered, facilitated workshops, and was a program director for PoHE. \u201cPersonally, as a mentor, I find the program to be rewarding when I see past mentees as student organizers and leaders within their college organizations after graduating from high school,\u201d he says. King will be directing the 6th annual Pursuit of Higher Education in the 2014 spring semester. Recently, HSAB held a panel for the visiting Southeast Asian students in a program at Fresno City College. Four UC Berkeley Hmong students from HSAB shared their experiences at Cal with these students who are on track for transferring from community college to a four year institution. Chao Yang, now a third year undergraduate transfer student at Cal and a general member of HSAB, used to be a Fresno City College student in the same program as these Southeast Asian students. Chao served as a panelist for the recent Fresno City College visit, one of his ways of giving back to his community. \u201cI wanted to show these students that the reality of community college transfers, especially Hmong students, was very possible. I feel like so many students settle for less and end up missing out on opportunities that their potential can offer,\u201d says Chao. HSAB continues to represent not only Cal but the greater Hmong community with their projects and events. Every year, HSAB participates in tabling at the Hmong New Year to promote their projects and events and provide information about higher education. This year HSAB will participate in the Sacramento Hmong New Year (Nov. 28th- Dec. 1st) and the Fresno International Hmong New Year (Dec. 26th- Jan. 1st) along with a project called \u201cHSAB\u2019s Average-Face Project.\u201d \u201cHSAB\u2019s Average-Face Project\u201d was inspired by another project that presented the average faces of women from all over the world by their country. HSAB will be tabling at both New Years where they will be taking photographs of individuals, compiling them together to create the average faces of males and females from the Hmong community. Pachia Vang, a fourth year undergraduate transfer student who is the lead organizer of this project and the Public Relations Coordinator of HSAB says, \u201cI want to bring the Hmong community together by fostering value and appreciation of the Hmong identity through the experience of art. And from that I want them to see and understand that we, the Hmong people and the Hmong culture, are also an important part of this growing and modern world.\u201d Although \u201cHSAB\u2019s Average Face Project\u201d takes part in bringing the Hmong community together, it is also determined to shatter the stereotype of college that the Hmong community forms. HSAB wants to show how pursuing a higher education can be fun and worthwhile with this project. The Hmong Student Association at Berkeley stands for their community, whether it be at UC Berkeley or in the greater Hmong community. HSAB continues to advocate for higher education and continues to keep the Hmong community at Cal present, 44 Hmong students standing strong as of today.\n\n\n","html":"by maxie moua\r\n\r\nSince 1975, the Hmong have immigrated here to the United States, fleeing from the oppression of Lao Communists from the Vietnam War then leaving the refugee camps of Thailand for a better, promising future in America.

HSAB continues to represent not only Cal but the greater Hmong community with their projects and events. Every year, HSAB participates in tabling at the Hmong New Year to promote their projects and events and provide information about higher education. This year HSAB will participate in the Sacramento Hmong New Year (Nov. 28th- Dec. 1st) and the Fresno International Hmong New Year (Dec. 26th- Jan. 1st) along with a project called \u201cHSAB\u2019s Average-Face Project.\u201d \u201cHSAB\u2019s Average-Face Project\u201d was inspired by another project that presented the average faces of women from all over the world by their country. HSAB will be tabling at both New Years where they will be taking photographs of individuals, compiling them together to create the average faces of males and females from the Hmong community. Pachia Vang, a fourth year undergraduate transfer student who is the lead organizer of this project and the Public Relations Coordinator of HSAB says, \u201cI want to bring the Hmong community together by fostering value and appreciation of the Hmong identity through the experience of art. And from that I want them to see and understand that we, the Hmong people and the Hmong culture, are also an important part of this growing and modern world.\u201d Although \u201cHSAB\u2019s Average Face Project\u201d takes part in bringing the Hmong community together, it is also determined to shatter the stereotype of college that the Hmong community forms. HSAB wants to show how pursuing a higher education can be fun and worthwhile with this project. The Hmong Student Association at Berkeley stands for their community, whether it be at UC Berkeley or in the greater Hmong community. HSAB continues to advocate for higher education and continues to keep the Hmong community at Cal present, 44 Hmong students standing strong as of today.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 15:13:42 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 15:13:42 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 15:13:42 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3370,"title":"Getting Angry with Angry Asian Man","slug":"getting-angry-with-angry-asian-man","markdown":"\n<div title=\"Page 16\"> by jenny lu <div title=\"Page 16\"><div><div><div> On November 4, 2013, Phil Yu, also known as Angry Asian Man, came to UC Berkeley to speak about his blog, the API community, and the issues that the API community face. Angry Asian Man is a popular blog that offers news coverage on everyday issues, popular culture, events, and anything that has to do with the API community. In my interview with Phil Yu, we were able to discuss briefly about his role in the API community and how he has a lot of influence in the API community. Phil amplifies the voice of the community and keeps us informed about things that are relevant to us, whether it\u2019s covering the details of a racist fraternity party across the country or keeping us updated about the production of Sriracha, the information Phil provides is something we can all relate to\u2014it\u2019s information about us. Finally, there is content made for the API community and catered to the API community. During our interview, Phil also talked about his name \u201cAngry Asian Man\u201d and what being \u201cangry\u201d really means. Angry isn\u2019t simply the feeling of anger, it\u2019s the action of speaking up. It\u2019s the voice that reminds us as APIs that it is okay to express ourselves and to understand that racist shit does happen and it\u2019s okay to be upset and angry about these things. Most importantly, it\u2019s okay to be \u201cangry\u201d and take action, speak up, and do something about the discrimination APIs still face today. Too often, the API identities, experiences, and community issues are invisiblized. A lot of this has to do with the infamous \u201cmodel minority myth\u201d\u2014the myth that Asians are successful and that we\u2019ve all worked hard and made it in a post-racial America. That is far from the truth. We\u2019re constantly forced to embody these stereotypes, including the model minority, through media, interpersonal and even internalized racism. The struggles that the API community goes through is often silenced and swept under the rug. This is why it\u2019s important for us to have a space for us to learn about what\u2019s going on in the community as well as talk about these issues. Blogs like Angry Asian Man and publications like hardboiled offer this voice to talk about problems that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be addressed, this space to discuss and dialogue about our common struggles and how we can take action against them, and acceptance to all opinions and experiences. It\u2019s time we express ourselves. It\u2019s time we tell our stories, address our struggles, validate our personal experiences, and embrace the cultures and identities we come from. There\u2019s no room to be apologetic. Speak up. And in the words of Phil Yu, aka Angry Asian Man: Stay Angry. \u00a0 <\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>**Q&A with Phil Yu**<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What is your role in the API community?<\/span> PY: I run a blog called Angry Asian Man, which is an Asian American news culture blog covering everything from politics to pop culture, weird\u00a0internet stuff, and just general everyday API community issues. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How would you describe your style of blogging?<\/span> PY: My style of blogging...

It\u2019s defined by so many different experiences and there\u2019s no one way to be Asian or PI and I think that part of what I do with my blog is show that there\u2019s no one definition of this. There\u2019s not one defined career path. There are people who are doing well and there are people who are struggling, we all have our own set of struggles and challenges. There\u2019s our share of discrimination and there are people who are doing really well and triumphing and making us proud. It\u2019s a very diverse collection of experiences and people all bundled into one. I think that it\u2019s really something that is messy at times, but its also something we draw strength from\u2014these diverse experiences. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What is the story behind the name AAM and what does \u201cangry\u201d mean to you?<\/span> PY: First of all, I\u2019m not a particularly angry person.

I chose the name Angry Asian Man because the idea of Asians being angry is in opposition to general perceptions of Asians in America, which is that we\u2019re docile... that we\u2019re the model minority... that we\u2019re going to keep our head down and not rock the boat. So, I kind of wanted something that is a little more provocative and something that said it\u2019s okay for Asians to speak up. It\u2019s okay for Asians to have a voice and get angry. Because too often, we don\u2019t, I feel like. It\u2019s kind of overpegged that way. It\u2019s also terrible that we kind of accept that notion. I wanted to have something that is sort of like a rallying cry... to this idea that you can be vocal and angry. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In hardboiled, we have a motto: \u2018always in bold.\u2019 What does being\u2018bold\u2019 mean to you?<\/span> PY: It\u2019s putting yourself out there and not having fear. That\u2019s something I\u2019m learning\u2014not to be afraid and to really take risks and not fall into usual patterns, to try to step out and not be comfortable. Be bold and put yourself out there. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Do you have any advice, inspiring words, or messages you want to give to the readers of hardboiled and the API community?<\/span> PY: I feel like so much of our community is preoccupied with getting the next thing... working towards getting the next thing, getting better or to the next level, whatever that might be whether it\u2019s career or academic accolades or profession. I feel like we don\u2019t look closely enough at what makes us passionate and what really drives us. My message would be to seek out what makes you passionate... find out what you want to care about and do that. Everything will fall into place.

Being the son of a U.S. Navy veteran, I grew up under the expectation to be tough, that complaining and excuses were weak, and that if I were thrown into the streets, I should be able to take care of myself. This is probably the part in the story where I should say \u201cbut I found strength, not in the way I was expected to,\u201d like I rejected the idea of masculine toughness. Truth is, I actually liked it. I grew up loving the idea of being tough, of intimidating others. I did not even reject the whole stereotype that \u201cAsians are supposed to be good in combat,\u201d I actually embraced it. And even my role models in the APA \/ API community began reflecting that as well. In history, my favorite figures were usually warriors and conquerors. I grew up hearing songs of Lapu-Lapu\u2019s victory against Magellan and reading texts from Sun Tzu\u2019s \u201cArt of War.\u201d My other role models were warriors in their own way. I was among those cheering when Manny Pacquiao and Nonito Donaire knocked out Ricky Hatton and Fernando Montiel in their respective second rounds, when Mark Munoz came back to the UFC with a dominant win after recovering from depression, and when Jackie Chan or Jet Li made a movie. To me, combat and combat sports are a key part of my identity and they are key to the Asian community since martial arts are embedded in our culture. And the truth is that the fighting is just one aspect to it. There is more to fighting than just beating your opponent. I was involved in karate for at least five years. I finished at purple belt and although each dojo has a different color system for their belts, I will say purple was pretty high. It was pretty close to black so I was proud of that. Among my friends, at the time I could only think of two who had experience in combat sports. One is sophomore Sameer Nayak, who has been involved in tawkondo since the beginning of the semester, senior Alex Lee who has been involved in kendo since his freshman year, and junior Nicco Marcus who has been involved in fencing for six years and also in media coverage of professional boxing. Karate, taekwondo, kendo, and fencing, are all different fields with different philosophies to them. Karate is based around humility and clearness of mind, taekwondo is around creating peace by cultivating each individual person, kendo is around always being the aggressor (that your best defense should be your best offense), and fencing is around being able to get hit and taking it. But all four of them have one thing in common; this is to better yourself as a person rather than learning how to be violent. And that, in my opinion, is the most commonly forgotten aspect of combat sports. Ask anyone in combat sports and they will tell you that if you are going to be here, you have to do it to better yourself as a person. You do not do this for stress relief since, according to Nicco, you can potentially hurt someone by taking your frustrations out on your fellow dojomates. You do not do it because you saw your favorite anime character fighting others since, according to Alex, your preconceived notions of combat sports is most likely wrong. You do not do this to learn how to beat someone up since, according to Sameer, bettering yourself is the goal, not destroying someone else. And yet so many people express interest in combat and combat sports because it\u2019s cool and flashy and they want to hurt people. By reducing martial arts to just something that\u2019s cool, instead of recognizing its philosophy and culture is how stereotypes of combat sports came to be. The most prevalent stereotype of combat sports in my opinion is the stereotype that all Asians are good in combat sports. It makes sense; most of the martial arts people think of are based in or originated from Asia; karate, taekwondo, kendo, wushu, muay thai, eskrima, aikido, jujutsu, BJJ, judo, and so on. Then we have a lot of celebrities from Asia, like Jackie Chan and JetLi,making movies that help solidify the image of Asians as combat experts. For example, in The Expendables, Li\u2019s characters was actually named the martial arts expert of the group while Chan, no matter what setting or type of character he plays, always plays someone adept at martial arts. And to be honest, this is a stereotype that I feel a lot of Asian people wouldn\u2019t mind. I mean, who in their right mind is going to make fun of an Asian person by saying they\u2019re good at fighting? As someone who has been made fun of for being Asian, this is nothing compared to the other, more potent insults people have come up with to disparage the API \/ APA community. But in the end, a stereotype is a stereotype. Even though there is supposedly a positive idea to this, you are still \u201creducing a community to a trait\u201d (Nicco) and \u201chelps strengthen the model minority myth directed to Asians\u201d (Alex). By reducing martial arts as just \u201csomething Asians do,\u201d you limit both the arts and Asians as a whole. For the community, it limits many of us to just the role of the martial arts expert. If you do martial arts, great, you are Asian. But if you do not, then there is something wrong with you. Even Hollywood is guilty of this typecasting since every time there is an \u201cAsian insert-type-of-martial-arts-they-are- using expert,\u201d they are usually written with little character development and only exists for flashy fight scenes. It is hard trying to find a role where Asians are not martial arts experts and the times where they are not, APIs are usually cast as villains, socially distant people, or the comic relief, the other stereotypes APIs are given in the media. So at times, APIs are forced to choose between taking a character that glorifies one stereotype versus a role that glorifies another stereotype. And even though the martial arts stereotype is not as damaging, it is still very limiting. Due to the stereotypes listed above, martial arts has been blended together to produce something that just looks cool. That it does not matter if karate is replaced by kung fu even though the movie is called \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201d To the ignorant, they are all the same. With these stereotypes, we forget that each martial arts has their own philosophy, history, and goal. The morals you learn from it is not restricted to Asians but can be applied to anyone. That is why If you truly respect the arts, respect it as a whole, not just for the fighting.\n\n\n","html":"It Is Not Just Fightighting\r\n\r\nby isiah regacho\r\n\r\nWhen I was young, I was taught to be tough both mentally and physically.

It was a journey I had started planning during my sophomore year, mapping every requirement and class to make sure everything would go smoothly. I was born in Guangzhou, China, and I had visited Hong Kong a handful of times before. It was familiar enough to have the potential of home, and foreign enough to fill nine months of adventure. Most importantly, I chose it because I wanted to improve my Cantonese, and Hong Kong is one of its strongholds outside the United States. I grew up speaking Cantonese with my family, but as I put more distance between myself, Chinese school, and my hometown, I was losing my ability to articulate my ambitions and values to my mother. And that was infinitely sad to me, because she has been the only one I have ever wanted to fight for. She is the reason I majored in Social Welfare and Asian American Studies. It is her resilience as a low-income, single mother that I carry with me as I pursue a career in public policy. And it is her struggle and story that root me in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, where so many immigrant families like mine hustle day in and day out for the next generation. So I set out for a city that embraced me with its humidity, bright lights, and endless eats. Studying abroad was more affordable than I had thought, thanks largely to several scholarships, including a University of California award and the Gilman International Scholarship.

It was a journey I had started planning during my sophomore year, mapping every requirement and class to make sure everything would go smoothly.\r\n\r\nI was born in Guangzhou, China, and I had visited Hong Kong a handful of times before. It was familiar enough to have the potential of home, and foreign enough to fill nine months of adventure. Most importantly, I chose it because I wanted to improve my Cantonese, and Hong Kong is one of its strongholds outside the United States. I grew up speaking Cantonese with my family, but as I put more distance between myself, Chinese school, and my hometown, I was losing my ability to articulate my ambitions and values to my mother.\r\n\r\nAnd that was infinitely sad to me, because she has been the only one I have ever wanted to fight for.\r\n\r\nShe is the reason I majored in Social Welfare and Asian American Studies. It is her resilience as a low-income, single mother that I carry with me as I pursue a career in public policy. And it is her struggle and story that root me in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, where so many immigrant families like mine hustle day in and day out for the next generation.\r\n\r\nSo I set out for a city that embraced me with its humidity, bright lights, and endless eats. Studying abroad was more affordable than I had thought, thanks largely to several scholarships, including a University of California award and the Gilman International Scholarship. I had also saved money from multiple part-time jobs, and I am thankful for the privilege that allowed me to travel as I did.\r\n\r\nI opted not to live in the international dorm but in a dorm with mostly locals.

At 17 years old, Zayn auditioned for the X Factor (a singing television competition) in the United Kingdom in 2010. He was placed in a group with four other members: Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, and Harry Styles. Together, they made up the band One Direction. Four years later, One Direction has become one of the most popular, record-breaking, award winning bands in our time. I know what you might be thinking \u2026 how is One Direction relevant to hardboiled and Asian Pacific Islander (API) issues? Now to give you a little more background information, Zayn Malik of One Direction is of mixed race. Zayn is of English and Pakistani descent\u2014his mother is English and his father is English-Pakistani. Additionally, Zayn identifies as Muslim. To ease into this topic, let\u2019s first talk about his mixed race identity. Zayn is half-white and half- Pakistani. Pakistan, located in South Asia, falls within the API identity. Too often, we see photos of Zayn, photoshopped by fans around Tumblr and other social media sites with whiter skin, blue\/green eyes, and other aspects and characteristics of white aesthetics. What does this say about race in popular media and the music industry? And how does this play a bigger role in Zayn\u2019s Pakistani and Muslim backgrounds? Zayn is often dubbed \u201cthe mysterious bad boy\u201d of One Direction across different media channels and celebrity gossip, like MTV and Seventeen Magazine. When looking at the physical features of each member of One Direction, it\u2019s clear that Zayn stands out from the rest as the only person of color; Zayn is the ethnic minority in the group, which causes him to look \u201cdifferent\u201d from the rest of the band. The \u201cbad boy\u201d image comes from a long-formed stereotype of men of color seen as bad, mischievous and up to trouble, which generates a sense of danger. There is a certain fetishization of Zayn and his mixed race background where his physical aesthetics as Pakistani make him look like a \u201cbad boy\u201d, including his darker skin tone, dark hair, and many tattoos (which includes a quote in Arabic and his grandfather\u2019s Arabic name). Again, this image of Zayn ties into the way men of color are often perceived in society. A part of the mystery also comes from his culture and background, making Zayn seem \u201cexotic\u201d. Zayn is of Muslim faith, and large portions of his fans are not. There is this \u201cmystery\u201d behind not knowing about his culture and religion, which places the only member of One Direction who is not full European in a place where he seems to be part of the \u201cunknown\u201d. Zayn becomes \u201cexotic\u201d as someone we have to figure out and try to understand because we, as society, cannot comprehend the idea of Zayn being a normal human being, Zayn becomes someone who is \u201cdifferent\u201d because he is not exactly the same as the other boys in One Direction. Racialicious, a popular online blog that addresses the intersection of race and pop culture, stated, \u201cZayn being a half-Pakistani Muslim was what counted as mysterious these days. He was exotic. He was dark. He was different. He was the other. He wasn\u2019t plain and boring like the rest of this pale-skinned, bright-eyed bandmates, all of whom could\u2019ve been the good ol\u2019 boys next door.\u201d The problem with fetishizing Zayn for his identity and faith is that people begin to conflate cultures. Zayn\u2019s identity as a Muslim triggered numerous attacks, as he was directly called a \u201cterrorist\u201d and accused of causing 9\/11. Rucka Rucka Ali, an infamous YouTuber, even went as far as to make a parody music video and soundtrack sold on iTunes that was called \u201cZayn did 9\/11\u201d. Throughout the video, there were pictures of Zayn and the incident that happened in New York on September 11, 2001. Zayn was even personally attacked on his Twitter account, receiving racist tweets about his celebration of Eid, a Muslim holiday. In an interview in 2012, Zayn shared, \u201cNasty things were said like I\u2019m a terrorist. How can you justify that? How can you call me that and get away with it?\u201d \u201cI believe that your religion should be between you and whoever your belief is in.\u201d The strong, hateful words sent to Zayn on Twitter forced him to quit and leave the social media site for a short while. Zayn\u2019s personal reaction to the racism he was receiving shows the deep impact racism has on individuals. Zayn has no personal connection to the incident that happened on 9\/11, yet he has to take on an emotional toll due to the violent verbal attacks he receives. This is only one example of the day-to-day life many Muslim- identified have to go through because of the hate and stereotypes that are placed on them due to their faith. Zayn\u2019s experiences have just been amplified because of this fame and popularity. Debbie Schlussel, a notorious conservative blogger, stirred controversy when she wrote an article about Zayn in 2012, stating, \u201c[Zayn Malik] is pimping Islam on your kids. That\u2019s in addition to his Arabic tattoos and frequent donning of the keffiyeh, the official garb of Islamic terrorism\u2026 He knows the power he has over these mindless [One Direction fans] and is using that influence to preach the Islamic faith to them and try to convert them. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d In the larger context, Zayn\u2019s popularity and identity as a Pakistani Muslim was being used to further spread ideas of \u201cterrorism\u201d and to racially target the Muslim community in an attempt to generate fear. Zayn\u2019s experiences in no way are absolutely representative of the entire Muslim and Pakistani communities in general, but the racism he has faced does stem from his background. While the four members of One Direction don\u2019t have to deal with being racially, ethnically, or religiously attacked, Zayn Malik has had a different experience. As the only member in One Direction with a different faith and ethnic identity, Zayn has been targeted, attacked, and bombarded with racist comments and tweets. Just because Zayn\u2019s experience is the only one we hear about publicly doesn\u2019t mean these types of racist aggressions don\u2019t exist in the lives of other people who identify as Muslim and\/or Pakistani. These interactions, hate, and racist attacks happen on a day- to-day basis for some people, and it\u2019s important to recognize the problems that stem from this. As any person of color living in the United States or in the United Kingdom, our ethnic identity never leaves us. While some people have the privilege of not having to worry or consciously think about race and ethnicity, we don\u2019t have that. The idea of \u201crace\u201d is always attached to us.\n\n\n","html":"he \u201cMysterious Bad Boy\u201d of One Direction\r\n\r\nby jenny lu\r\n\r\nZayn Malik is one of five members in the popular British boy band One Direction.

Most recently, UCLA\u2019s undergraduate student council was locked in a heated debate about targeted divestment. This proposal sought to divest from companies affiliated with the Israeli military and companies who profit from Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian territories. In February, UCLA\u2019s student council struck down a \u201cResolution to Divest From Companies that Violate Palestinian Human Rights\u201d. In 2013, a similar measure was proposed and passed at UC Berkeley. The bill, SB 160, announced a withdrawal of $14 million from companies affiliated with Israel\u2019s military, such as Hewlett-Packard and Caterpillar. UC Berkeley\u2019s student government was not the first to pass a resolution on this issue; UC San Diego and UC Irvine\u2019s student governments had previously passed similar targeted divestment measures. Public debates about the Israel-Palestine conflict have not existed exclusively among students \u2013 higher education faculty associations have moved towards taking a public stand on this issue. Within the past year, the American Studies Association, the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association Council, and the Association for Asian American Studies voted in support of a resolution to boycott Israeli academic institutions. As hardboiled, we are interested in the roles that Asian American students and faculty have played in this issue. Among API social justice networks, it is evident that there is a prominent Pro-Palestine leaning. Viveka Jagadeesan from Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) says, \u201cBecause of the intersectional nature of oppression, many folks involved in other social justice work get involved in SJP when they learn about the issues\u2026 virtually every social justice oriented cultural organization agreed with the need for divestment from companies complicit in the occupation [at Berkeley]. People who are involved in any kind of resistance understand that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d But, as many API students may not feel the direct impact of the conflict in the Middle East, what motivates political involvement in support of Palestine? For the Association for Asian American Studies (AAAS), its core values of resistance to imperialism and racial discrimination, the right to education, and self-determination of disenfranchised groups and academic rights struck a chord with the Pro-Palestine movement. Last spring, the AAAS became the first academic entity in the United States to boycott Israeli academic institutions. The \u201cSupport Boycott of Israeli Academic Institutions\u201d resolution passed with no objections and no abstentions. This resolution called \u201cfor AAAS to honor the call of Palestinian civil society for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions; and to support the protected rights of students and scholars everywhere to engage in research and public speaking about Israel-Palestine and in support of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement.\u201d The AAAS resolution justified its alliance with the Palestinian community, arguing that both entities hold common experiences in migration, displacement, colonialism, and racism. The association further alluded to its academic mission saying, \u201cThe Association for Asian American Studies seeks to advance a critique of [the] U.S. empire, opposing US military occupation in the Arab world and U.S. support for occupation and racist practices by the Israeli state\u201d. This resolution targeted Israeli higher education institutions by protesting Israel\u2019s severe restrictions on foreign academics and students who affiliate with Palestine. The AAAS also stated its disapproval of the \u201csystematic maintenance of the occupation and of policies and practices that discriminate against Palestinian students and scholars throughout Palestine and in Israel\u201d. To what extent are Asian Americans informed about this international issue? A student activist from SJP says, \u201cI think API students \u2026 are informed to varying degrees about major events in the Middle East. I think South Asian students seem to be more aware because many of them are personally impacted whether you are talking about U.S. imperialism in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India or Islamophobia that targets anyone who \u2018looks\u2019 like a Muslim.\u201d While being both informed and educated is one thing, Asian American students have been actively involved by supporting student organizations on their campuses. The same student comments, \u201cI got involved in SJP and helped to build the campus BDS movement because I believe in the need for an international solidarity movement to challenge U.S. imperialism in Palestine and the broader Middle East.\u201d Lisa Lee, a student activist from UC Irvine, got involved through her own social justice networks. Lee says, \u201cSome of my closest friends were deeply involved with the divestment movement and I tried to help out as much as possible. I guess I got involved because I shared similar values of justice and liberation.\u201d How have Asian American students gotten involved on an international issue to which we seem to have loose ties to? For Lee, she credits the solidarity movement between API students and the Palestinian cause as a result ofher student organization\u2019s consciousness-raising and politicizing endeavors. Lee says, \u201cUCI is a majority Asian population on campus and only a margin of students are involved with any politics. However, I do see many APIs involved with the movement. Many have been politicized through cross-cultured spaces \u2026. we act as active allies and support through rallies, petitioning, and whatever they need us to do.\u201d The conflict between Israel and Palestine is a deeply personal issue for individuals on both sides. But for those of us who are neither first-handedly affected nor hold ties to the region, what can we do? Do we sit on the sidelines and watch? Do we abstain? As Asian Americans, we hold a unique identity and history; and as students, we are given the tools necessary to be thoughtful and critical of the world around us. It is important to embrace the work on both sides that promotes peace and to understand that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a not a simply black and white issue.\n\n\n","html":"What Role Are Students and Faculty Members Playing?\r\n\r\nby sophia ng\r\n\r\nThe ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict has penetrated into the higher education sphere, propelling both students and faculties of diverse backgrounds to vocalize their opinions on this issue.

Last spring, the AAAS became the first academic entity in the United States to boycott Israeli academic institutions. The \u201cSupport Boycott of Israeli Academic Institutions\u201d resolution passed with no objections and no abstentions. This resolution called \u201cfor AAAS to honor the call of Palestinian civil society for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions; and to support the protected rights of students and scholars everywhere to engage in research and public speaking about Israel-Palestine and in support of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe AAAS resolution justified its alliance with the Palestinian community, arguing that both entities hold common experiences in migration, displacement, colonialism, and racism. The association further alluded to its academic mission saying, \u201cThe Association for Asian American Studies seeks to advance a critique of [the] U.S. empire, opposing US military occupation in the Arab world and U.S. support for occupation and racist practices by the Israeli state\u201d. This resolution targeted Israeli higher education institutions by protesting Israel\u2019s severe restrictions on foreign academics and students who affiliate with Palestine. The AAAS also stated its disapproval of the \u201csystematic maintenance of the occupation and of policies and practices that discriminate against Palestinian students and scholars throughout Palestine and in Israel\u201d.\r\n\r\nTo what extent are Asian Americans informed about this international issue? A student activist from SJP says, \u201cI think API students \u2026 are informed to varying degrees about major events in the Middle East. I think South Asian students seem to be more aware because many of them are personally impacted whether you are talking about U.S. imperialism in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India or Islamophobia that targets anyone who \u2018looks\u2019 like a Muslim.\u201d While being both informed and educated is one thing, Asian American students have been actively involved by supporting student organizations on their campuses. The same student comments, \u201cI got involved in SJP and helped to build the campus BDS movement because I believe in the need for an international solidarity movement to challenge U.S. imperialism in Palestine and the broader Middle East.\u201d Lisa Lee, a student activist from UC Irvine, got involved through her own social justice networks. Lee says, \u201cSome of my closest friends were deeply involved with the divestment movement and I tried to help out as much as possible. I guess I got involved because I shared similar values of justice and liberation.\u201d How have Asian American students gotten involved on an international issue to which we seem to have loose ties to? For Lee, she credits the solidarity movement between API students and the Palestinian cause as a result ofher student organization\u2019s consciousness-raising and politicizing endeavors. Lee says, \u201cUCI is a majority Asian population on campus and only a margin of students are involved with any politics. However, I do see many APIs involved with the movement. Many have been politicized through cross-cultured spaces \u2026. we act as active allies and support through rallies, petitioning, and whatever they need us to do.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestine is a deeply personal issue for individuals on both sides. But for those of us who are neither first-handedly affected nor hold ties to the region, what can we do? Do we sit on the sidelines and watch? Do we abstain? As Asian Americans, we hold a unique identity and history; and as students, we are given the tools necessary to be thoughtful and critical of the world around us. It is important to embrace the work on both sides that promotes peace and to understand that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a not a simply black and white issue.","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":684,"created_at":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 19:29:27 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 19:29:27 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 19:29:27 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3524,"title":"24th Annual APIICON","slug":"24th-annual-apiicon","markdown":"\nby maxie moua Just recently, UC Berkeley hosted its 24th annual APIICON with a great line of speakers, workshops, and entertainment. The Asian Pacific Islander Issues Conference (APIICON) began in 1990 with a strong aspiration to bring together the API community from the Bay Area to discuss API issues. This conference opened up a space for students, professors, and community members to engage in dialogue about the underrepresentation of API communities. APIICON is a conference put together by a lead team consisting of Cal API students from the Asian Pacific American Student Development (APASD) center. The 24th annual APIICON was sponsored by APASD, the Asian American Studies & Diaspora Studies, ASUC, and Ethnic Studies 5th Account.

Beyond the twLF, solidarity in the API community was expressed by the guest speakers and workshops in terms of inclusion, engagement, visibility, and transformation. Mia Mingus, an API activist in the Bay Area for disability justice and transformative justice, kicked off the conference with her honest thoughts on solidarity within the API community. Over two hundred people of color attended APIICON on Saturday, March 8th, 2014. Even though this was an API conference, there were community members, college students, and even high school youths of all colors from Oregon and Northern\/Southern California present at the conference. Jayden Thai, an API activist in the LGBTQIA community, traveled from Kentucky to speak and inspire the APIICON attendees with his stories and progressive ideas of solidarity. The first session of the workshops provided spaces for attendees to learn about the API LGBTQIA communities, incarcerated APIs, and contemporary issues within the API community. The entertainment portion of the conference presented the Hmong Student Association at Berkeley (HSAB) and their elegant Hmong dance followed by a stand-up comedy act by Irene Tu, an API student at Cal. Bryant Phan, a Mien spoken word and poetry artist from Stanford, brought a powerful atmosphere to the conference while Rey Resurrection, a recording artist and producer growing in the mainstream, charmed the crowd of attendees with his beats and lyrical raps. In the second session of the workshops, the floor was opened up for dialogue about API revolutions and historical movements. The conference closed off with UC Berkeley\u2019s Professor Katharaya Um, a community advocate and the first Cambodian-American womyn to receive a PhD, passing on her words of unity and solidarity within a large and growing community. I myself attended the conference on that perfect-weathered Saturday. Being a first year, this was my first time at an API conference. I am Hmong-American and grew up in the Central Valley. I didn\u2019t know what API was nor did I know what solidarity looked like until I started attending Cal. APIICON was a great exposure to solidarity and how the API community comes together to work in and on solidarity. As the API community progresses and as APIICON grows, whether in quantity or quality, the themes of solidarity, unity, and diversity will be perpetuated and built upon.\n\n\n","html":"by maxie moua\r\n\r\nJust recently, UC Berkeley hosted its 24th annual APIICON with a great line of speakers, workshops, and entertainment.

All three of these women embody the characteristics of being a stereotypical white, blond-haired, American female. However, even before the Games began, controversy arose. In January this year, the U.S. Olympic Figure Skating team was announced after the results of the 2014 U.S. National Championships. The Olympic Figure Skating team is usually comprised of the three top scorers from that competition, with an exception of 4 past incidents in which one of the top 3 were injured, thus being replaced by the person in 4th. Japanese American skater, 20-year-old Mirai Nagasu, was left out of the U.S. Team, despite skating her best performance and placing 3rd in the U.S. National Championship. Nagasu even placed 4th in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics when she was only 16 years old. Despite falling twice during her free skate program and placing 4th, Wagner, who is of German heritage, was chosen over Nagasu. After her free skate program in the championships on January 11, Wagner tweeted, \u201cI am so sorry. I let you all down,\u201d noting her disappointing performance. Despite all this, what should have been Nagusu\u2019s was stripped away and instead given to Wagner, who later tweeted, \u201cIt's been a long 4 years to this point.

Although selection for the team takes into account the skater\u2019s entire career, why was Nagasu, a former Olympic skater who performed and scored higher at the U.S. Championships, booted from a spot on the team? Critics questioned this controversial decision and used social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, to express their opinions. They voiced their opinions through the creation of the hashtag #MiraiEarnedIt. Twitter users even expressed that they believed that Wagner was chosen not because of talent but because she was more marketable than Nagasu. Wagner, although born in Germany, fits into the all-American girl mold along with Gold and Edmunds. There have also been speculations that the Olympic team was chosen vast before the U.S. Championships occurred. Asian and Asian American female presence has been very strong in the world of figure skating, especially in the Sochi Olympics with South Korea\u2019s Yuna Kim and Japan\u2019s Mao Asada as favorites to win the Women\u2019s Figure Skating program. The United States has also seen the likes of various Asian American women who have skated their way to the top: Kristi Yamaguchi, the 1992 Olympic champion, Michelle Kwan, two -time Olympic medalist who is also known as the most decorated figure skater in U.S. history and Nagusu, who at age 16 competed and placed 4th in the Winter Olympics Women\u2019s Single Figure Skate. In fact, at least one female Asian American figure skater had been selected for the U.S. Olympics team since Yamaguchi\u2019s reign. Controversy is not an uncommon occurrence in the world of figure skating. In 1998, Tara Lipinski beat out Kwan and took the gold medal, while Kwan received silver.

First, when I share my own experiences, I do so not to make the issue about me or generalize about the broader community, but to give readers a starting point at which they can relate to the topic of gender and sexuality. I speak for no one but myself, but I hope sharing my point of view forces others to think more critically. Second, in writing about trauma from sexual assault, I make this hardboiled article a means of healing from and unlearning violence. Lastly, I dedicate this piece to all those who have been silenced for their gender identity and sexuality.* Not everything began with the UCLA flier, but I will start there. On February 5, the UCLA Asian American Studies Center received an anonymously mailed document containing highly racist and misogynistic slurs. The next day, students received news that the same document had been sent to the Asian Pacific American Student Services at USC. Within a few days, student leaders in UCLA\u2019s Asian Pacific Coalition started a photo campaign tagged as \u201c#BeyondTheStereotype\u201d in which participants posed with messages of solidarity written on their arms. Soon campuses all over California joined in with their own campaigns, with growing coverage from local news media like the LA Times and ABC7. The rapid mobilization of students around the UCLA\/USC flier represented an urgent need to work together on combating racism within the educational system, but unfortunately, #BeyondTheStereotype and similar political campaigns lack a critical framework that addresses intersections across gender and sexuality. From my experience in various student spaces here at UC Berkeley, I have grown increasingly skeptical of \u201cvisibility\u201d campaigns that magnify issues of race and gender without consideration of how privilege plays out in student organizing spaces. In this piece, I pinpoint a specific weakness within my own community at Cal that also affects the wider APA population: an uneasy silence on issues of gender and sexuality, especially concerning transgender and queer identities. By now, activity around the UCLA\/USC document has died down. So why continue investigating this incident if it only attacked UCLA and USC? Well, the flyer itself did not anger me so much as the silence on gender and sexuality that it exposed in the Asian American spaces I call my community here at UC Berkeley. What followed in the wake of the #BeyondTheStereotype photo campaign initiated by UCLA was a growing discomfort felt by myself and several other female students on its highly gendered messages about strength and solidarity. The \u201cpoem\u201d on this page originally appeared in a Feb. 11 comment I posted on the Facebook event page for UC Berkeley\u2019s photo campaign, in which I critiqued the framing of the controversy for overemphasizing racism and minimizing sexism. A month has passed since UCLA and USC received the document, and I am disappointed that the #BeyondTheStereotype campaign has done little to build a critical dialogue on the shortcomings of student organizing. This inability to confront the daily reality of discrimination in the lives of cisgender women only furthers their oppression within the community, and by extension, queer and transgender folks suffer the most invalidation. I must acknowledge that the kind of violence I refer to ranges from verbal or written harassment, such as that in the UCLA document, to physical attacks that themselves may not leave any visible traces but still disrupt an individual\u2019s sense of safety. In order to respect confidentiality, I will not share here any of my personal encounters with violence, but rather draw on recent events that have brought my attention to the Asian American community\u2019s poor grasp of intersectionality, especially concerning race, gender, and sexuality. I recognize that my privilege in being a UC Berkeley student heavily influences my analysis of events that happen elsewhere in the Asian American community, and this limits my scope of knowledge. Yet I also believe that my education allows me the opportunity to speak on issues that all too often get ignored, and more than anything forces me to be even more accountable to the community for my actions and language. This past February, I had the honor of performing onstage at Wheeler Auditorium in front of 700 people a night for the Vagina Monologues. Created in 1994 by playwright and author Eve Ensler, the annual benefit performance raises awareness about violence against women and girls and takes place at campuses across the nation. As it does every year at UC Berkeley, the three-day show sold out every one of its 2100 tickets, of which the proceeds went to six organizations that advocate for women and LGBTQ youth. While I enjoyed the few minutes I spent in the spotlight, I wanted to be a part of Vag Mons because of the very real violence I have experienced as an Asian American woman. More than anything I needed a safe space to nurture my womanhood. And yet, a month after the show ended, I don\u2019t feel any more a woman than I did coming in. In the aftermath of the UCLA\/USC flier, the silence I felt in the Asian American community undid any confidence I sought to gain from my Vag Mons performance, and if anything have made me question even more why folks remain silent on issues of sexual violence. What right do we have to claim solidarity with each other when we tokenize the bodies and experiences of Asian Pacific American women, and leave out those of queer and transgender folks? I hope to bring attention to the deeply entrenched notions of gender and sexuality that all too often folks fear discussing. This fear manifests in very ugly ways, and I will venture to give examples from my own life but also connect the UCLA flier to more systemic issues. As full of anger and frustration as I am, I know better than to take these negative emotions out on the people around me. Reproducing the same type of behavior that I condemn others for committing makes me not only a hypocrite, but also can accomplice to the systems of oppression that have claimed so many lives. So, what can I do beyond calling myself an \u201cally\u201d to homeless folks, the elderly, people with disabilities, the working-class, undocumented students, prisoners, refugees, etc.? Well, I need to learn to listen, and by listening, learning. The only silence we should condone is our own when we listen to those who more often than not tend to silence themselves for fear of being attacked, or because they expect no one to listen, or worse, when they do speak, their message gets distorted and reduced to quotes on Tumblr, taken completely out of context. In the same way that silence has hurt our communities and deprived us of the opportunity to heal, it can also be a space in which we reflect on ourselves, our work in social justice, and our relationships with each other. For all our protests and photo campaigns, listening to our own silence can do us good if it allows others the opportunity to be seen and heard.

First, when I share my own experiences, I do so not to make the issue about me or generalize about the broader community, but to give readers a starting point at which they can relate to the topic of gender and sexuality. I speak for no one but myself, but I hope sharing my point of view forces others to think more critically. Second, in writing about trauma from sexual assault, I make this hardboiled article a means of healing from and unlearning violence. Lastly, I dedicate this piece to all those who have been silenced for their gender identity and sexuality.<\/em>\r\n\r\nNot everything began with the UCLA flier, but I will start there. On February 5, the UCLA Asian American Studies Center received an anonymously mailed document containing highly racist and misogynistic slurs. The next day, students received news that the same document had been sent to the Asian Pacific American Student Services at USC. Within a few days, student leaders in UCLA\u2019s Asian Pacific Coalition started a photo campaign tagged as \u201c#BeyondTheStereotype\u201d in which participants posed with messages of solidarity written on their arms. Soon campuses all over California joined in with their own campaigns, with growing coverage from local news media like the LA Times and ABC7. The rapid mobilization of students around the UCLA\/USC flier represented an urgent need to work together on combating racism within the educational system, but unfortunately, #BeyondTheStereotype and similar political campaigns lack a critical framework that addresses intersections across gender and sexuality.

This dynamic complicates some of the more common forms of elder abuse and sometimes works to prevent victims from seeking help when both the victim and the perpetrator are Asian American. Defined generally, elder abuse has five components: physical abuse, neglect and self- neglect, financial abuse, mental suffering, and isolation (Cal. W&I Code \u00a7 15610). Elder abuse has increasingly become a bigger problem as the changing landscape of the Asian American population forecasts the numbers of Asian Americans to grow, expects people to live longer and alone, and predicts the stratum of the U.S. population that is comprised of persons 65 years old or older to be the fastest growing group as Baby Boomers retire (Pew Research Center 2010). Further, an elderly person is more likely to be a victim of abuse as that person ages due to correlative health conditions, especially Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia, that While definitions of elder abuse and sociological patterns show that elder abuse is not race-specific, victims of elder abuse who are Asian may be fighting yet another battle, that is, one underneath the visible instances of abuse: Asian American elder abuse victims may be struggling with certain misconceptions of what constitutes elder abuse as well as with cultural taboos about reporting elder abuse when it occurs. Cultural values can shape Asian American victims\u2019 perceptions of elder abuse and determine willingness to seek help when the victims internalize their mistreatment according to Asian virtues of sacrifice and self-blaming. The victims regard elder abuse as a taboo because it is a direct contradiction of their values and expectations of how other people are supposed to treat the elderly with respect. As a result, this internal contradiction in the victims\u2019 minds run contrary to the state\u2019s goals of detection, prevention, and intervention. It may even turn out that the victim of elder abuse becomes resistant to voluntary and mandatory offers of help. Of course, there are various traditional socio-legal models of helping the victim. Solutions range from restraining orders, conservatorship, involvement of multiple agencies, and seeking family and community resources. However, what is needed is looking at these resources with an understanding of how cultural values can filter how Asian Americans view elder abuse. Many studies suggest that elder abuse among Asian Americans is underrepresented and therefore is not a problem. However, there is reason to believe that these statistics on elder abuse among the Asian American community might be heavily skewed because incidents of elder abuse of Asian American victims are significantly underreported. Further, primary studies suggest that perceptions of elder abuse also vary significantly in line with one\u2019s ethnicity, and thus generalizing about elder abuse across the entire Asian American group might be inappropriate. For instance, Chinese and Japanese Americans were more likely to justify yelling at their elderly parents than person of a different Asian American ethnicity. In another instance, an overwhelming percentage of Korean Americans studied reported that using their parents\u2019 money for their own use was an acceptable behavior (Moon 2012). While more research needs to confirm these findings, they nevertheless suggest a more nuanced understanding of elder abuse as one that is accentuated by one\u2019s own culture and one that is affected not only by racially defined cultural values but also ethnic-specific cultural paradigms.

The Third World Liberation strike was nothing short of revolutionary, a movement by students of color to reclaim their histories and carve their own place on campus. It remains a legacy to this campus and in some ways, to hardboiled, in continuing the activism on this campus and striving to create a space like the ones students in the TWLF strike fought for so many years ago. It can be hard to believe that just forty-five years ago, there was little to no opportunities for students of color to explore their own history or identity on campus. Growing up, I had very little exposure to Asian American history or activism. I was taught that Asian Americans were engineers, doctors, accountants; that they were silent; that they played a subordinate role in history and society. The only time I recall Asian American history being taught was about Chinese workers in the Gold Rush period and Japanese American internment, but at the time, I felt detached from both. My parents were recent immigrants, not descendants of Chinese railroad laborers or Japanese families interned during World War II. I didn\u2019t see it as my history or understand the legacy of their lives or the stereotypes of their time, and I never got the chance to explore my identity as an Asian American. Spaces like Asian American 20B, an introductory course to contemporary Asian American issues that I am taking now, and hardboiled are where I began my journey, and I cannot imagine what it must be like to have little to no classes that allow me to do that. But we don\u2019t have to look far. In 2010, Arizona banned classes that \u201care designed for a certain ethnicity\u201d or \u201cpromoted ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals,\u201d claiming these classes promoted resentment towards other races and socioeconomic classes and were unconstitutional. In particular, many Mexican American Studies classes throughout Arizona were closed, in a state whose population is almost one-third Hispanic. Ethnic Studies programs across the United States have also struggled to retain funding and status, including here in Berkeley. In 2010, an external review committee recommended that the UC Berkeley campus consolidate Asian American studies, Chicano\/Latino studies, and Native American studies under one Ethnic Studies major. And even today, many universities have failed to acknowledge the importance of an Ethnic Studies department on their own campus. Universities are also hotbeds of racism. From the Duke Racist Rager just last year, an Asian-themed frat party that basically encouraged incredibly offensive costumes and yellowface, to this year\u2019s UCLA flier, acts of racism is rampant, and it\u2019s not hard to hear blatantly racist jokes and language as you walk across any campus. Recognizing that these students are well-versed in physics, business, or whatever they may study, but understand so little about others\u2019 cultures and history is a difficult thing \u2013 and reminds me why Ethnic Studies courses are so important. As a professor of mine pointed out, Ethnic Studies classes are not just for minority students; they are important classes for everyone to take to gain a better understanding of each other and their world. And it shouldn\u2019t extend only to white students. I think the same can be said for students of color \u2013 that there should be more Asian Americans in African American Studies courses, Chicano\/Latino Studies courses and Native American Studies courses and vice versa. These histories are our stories too and a reality of our society, and we all benefit from understanding them. That is another legacy of the Third World Liberation Front. In 1969, students of color came together to fight for a common cause, a kind of cross-cultural solidarity that is often hard to see today. Today, it is still important to support each other in fighting inequality and injustice, even in the midst of our different goals and backgrounds. We come together in the wake of racism, but it\u2019s also important to come together to prevent them. The fight is not over. In 1969, Professor Paul Takagi said that the TWLF strikes was a rebellion rooted in the search of identity, and his words still ring true today. As society continues to impose stereotypes on the Asian American community and obscure discrimination, the fight to define ourselves also continues. That is why spaces like Ethnic Studies are so important in facilitating dialogue and sparking action. They allow students to understand and reclaim their history and personal stories, and as we honor those who have fought for us to have this space, we should continue to fight to create and protect safe spaces to discuss these important issues.\n\n\n","html":"by katherine wang\r\n\r\nForty-five years ago today, our campus was on the cusp of something historic.

Originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and now based in Taipei, Shia wears multiple hats as an artist, from organizing hip hop and live music events to overseeing the label [PPF House](http:\/\/ppfhouse.com\/) with his brothers to producing with creative collective [the BLAST](http:\/\/theblastlife.com\/). In this interview, Shia shares his thoughts on the rising interest towards hip hop in Taiwan and how family is at the heart of his work as an artist. <span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">*This will be the first in a series of interviews conducted by\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">**hardboiled**<\/span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"> staffer Sam Lai during her time in Taipei this summer. A little bit from Sam:\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">I first came across LEO37 on [Angry Asian Man](http:\/\/blog.angryasianman.com\/2011\/11\/music-video-fanfare-by-leo37.html) when the Fanfare music video was posted. What struck me the most was seeing a Taiwanese face not only rapping, but also rapping in a way that stood out from the hypermasculine Asian American hip hop artists I had seen. At the time, I had no idea that I would end up [meeting both Phil Yu](http:\/\/24.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_m6566sApze1rqmmq4o4_500.jpg) the Angry Asian Man and LEO37 in the next three years. PERKS OF BEING ASIAN AND A WRITER WOOT.<\/span>\n\n**So you\u2019ve been in Taiwan for eight years?** [edit: Shia has been in the hip hop game for eight years. Sam needs to do better research.]\n\nNo no, three years. I did a tour around Asia with my good friends MAGNOLIUS (Toronto-based Hip-Hop group), back in \u201806, and that was the first time I\u2019d been back as an adult: last time I was back I was 11. I was able to experience a lot, since a lot had changed. Back home, for independent Asian rappers, we were doing okay, had day jobs, but you start to see a roof. When I began to see some of my more favored counterparts and colleagues get deals, some major label, but see them struggle, I thought I\u2019d give it a shot out here. I started going back and forth for several years, and three years ago finally made the move [to Taipei].\n\n**What's a regular day for LEO37 look like?**As an independent artist, there's nothing regular. Nowadays, independent artists, they have hands in everything. They have to multi-task and be a lot more business minded. Pseudo-entrepreneurs if you will. My day-to-day, it depends. I do a lot of graphic design work, promotion: me and my two brothers (Howie and Tim) run PPF in Toronto and I have the Blast (Serpico, Poppa Baer and Oohchild) out here in Taipei. So it\u2019s different depending on the day. Obviously I'd like to be writing a lot more considering that\u2019s my technical job description and I have three different projects in three different countries that need finishing, but unfortunately, I can\u2019t be in the studio every day.\n\n**What's your approach to writing like?**\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><param name=\"src\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/2EnCEyZaSZM?hl=en_US&version=3&rel=0\"><\/param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"315\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/2EnCEyZaSZM?hl=en_US&version=3&rel=0\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\"><\/embed><\/object>My brother Howie, he did the videos for \"FANFARE,\" \"YOU & THE NITE,\" produced for my first two albums, did all the artwork for all my physical and digital releases, and he's a songwriter as well.

We hear back and his fee is like $100,000, including 7 or 8 flights, so okay, we\u2019re nowhere near that. So we started to focus on community and culture-driven projects to really build and contribute to the scene. Eventually we started getting a lot of great offers from artists on legacy runs but none of them ever seemed like the right fit. So when we got word from Ghostface and Raekwon, it was the right offer at the right time so we jumped at it. Contrary to what I had heard from other promoters, they were both real cool. Hell, Rae even taught us some new ways to play pool as he trash talked us at the table. It was surreal. **Can you tell me more about your projects?

Everyone had their foothold in different circles, and we tried to combine all our pros into something positive for the community.\n\nThanks to Serpico, we got started with Under Bridge that went on for almost a year [2012-2013], but then there was just a bunch of scheduling conflicts so we couldn't continue. It was like 150 to 300 kids every Sunday, while they got to hang out [and] listen to hip hop. The vibe that I got from that was what I got when I started. We had that for the kids. We did Nike summer nights, their first big streetball tournament in Taiwan, they had us take care of all the programming outside of the basketball. \u00a0It was amazing: five weeks, every week packed.\n\n [caption id=\"attachment_3643\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"][![Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012  PC: The BLAST website](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012-1024x693.jpg)](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012.jpg) Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012  \nPC: The BLAST website[\/caption] **Can you talk more about *Do You Want More*?**\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><param name=\"src\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&version=3&rel=0\"><\/param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"315\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&version=3&rel=0\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\"><\/embed><\/object>*Do You Want More?* had a live band and guests, and it was hugely successful for everyone who went. We started to do them monthly, add more guests, do more covers, live remixes, classic hip hop, funk R&B, the momentum kept going. It was the most successful live music event in Taiwan. We felt we kind of plateaued, so we changed it down to a quarterly event in order to make each one a little more special. DYWM became a cultural hub where you saw different cliques and scenes coming together to enjoy good live music. It\u2019s really a special event.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy because when we brought Icy Ice of the Beat Junkies [*DJ crew formed in 1992 in Orange County*], he told us, *Yo it's crazy cuz the vibe you guys have here is what it felt like for us 15-20 years ago*. But here, the skill level isn't there yet, and it's absolutely not at the fault of the Taiwanese artists. It's still a new culture, they haven't heard enough. The new kids now who are coming into an environment where they've been listening to hip hop, they're catching it faster than the older guys who are trying to maintain, it\u2019s exciting.\n\n**What would you describe your style of music as?**\n\nIt\u2019s not hip hop, but it is hip hop. Because of the internet these days, regional hip-hop is less and less evident. So it just depends what you\u2019re around and what inspires you. You got people like ASAP Rocky who sound like Houston but are from New York. I mean, ASAP Rocky grew up in New York, but the Houston sound, that\u2019s what New York radio was playing. It was organic. For me, depending on the producers I\u2019m working with, wherever I am in the world, or what stage in my life I\u2019m at, that will influence what sound I create. \u00a0But I still like to think my work, no matter how far it gets, is still Hip-Hop.\n\nAs the only Chinese kid in class, I didn\u2019t have rapper or DJ friends, I was an anomaly in my grade. But you know, while all the kids were listening to what they were, and I was listening the same things too, there\u2019s something about being a yellow kid in a pretty much white kids school [in that] hip hop just speaks to you. I was experiencing racism on a regular basis, maybe not outright but little slights here and there. I started getting an inkling of it, once I started touring outside Canada, I started to see\u2026but I truly believe there\u2019s no outright racism, it\u2019s ingrained. At the end of the day, I only had three role models in mainstream media growing up that looked like me: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Dragon Ball Z. I was never a huge fan of Jackie just cause he, more often than not always ended up being a clown. And Dragon Ball Z is a cartoon. So you\u2019re telling me that the last real male role model that I related to cuturally was 40 years ago? And I wasn\u2019t really old enough for [Bruce Lee] to be my role model as a kid. It\u2019s a weird scenario when you grow up in a climate where there was no one Asian to look up to. The Asian performers I saw seemed real cheesy to me where I was, and that wasn\u2019t anything I wanted to be. I understand why people wouldn\u2019t identify with Asian rappers. Not saying my lyrics are Asian-driven but there\u2019s a perspective [the audience] doesn\u2019t have and needs to be able to identify with my music. So I don\u2019t blame anyone. But building and growing a career in Canada was tough. There are good Asian rappers really struggling in the States too, so it made sense that I came to Taiwan and test the waters.\n\n**What\u2019s a challenge you\u2019ve faced in coming to Taiwan?**\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><param name=\"src\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&version=3&rel=0\"><\/param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"315\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&version=3&rel=0\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\"><\/embed><\/object>Language is still a problem, I don't speak it at a level that I need it to be. When I'm on stage, I wish I had more to say. I'm getting better. My banter is not that good, and I keep the shows tight cuz I don\u2019t say much. Rather than show my weaknesses, I just push my strengths. The fact that I don't rap in Chinese and refuse to (until it\u2019s at the level of my English) restricts my reach, so I promote and tour always with a band, because at least people can understand music and feeling, you [can] get that. For me, being out here, not only in Taiwan but being in Asia, with the exception of Singapore and the Philippines, everywhere else that doesn\u2019t speak English has forced me to step my stage game up. The challenge keeps things interesting.\n\n**Would you say that Taiwan is still in the early stage of its hip hop scene?**It is an early stage in Taiwan for hip hop: if hip hop started in 1976 or \u201878 in the US, then in Taiwan we\u2019re in the late 80s right now. [Rappers here] are starting to rap more about things they care about, rather than just being cool at the party, so that\u2019s refreshing, but it\u2019s still in its early stages.\n\n [caption id=\"attachment_3648\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"][![Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club PC: Joe Conzo\/WNYC](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Hip-hop-in-the-Bronx-at-the-Dixie-Club.jpg)](http:\/\/www.wnyc.org\/story\/89709-south-bronx-hip-hop-year-zero\/) Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club.  \nPC: Joe Conzo\/WNYC[\/caption] **Of course, hip hop is more than just rapping. How has the reception been for the other elements like DJing, graffiti, and break-dancing?**\n\nDance by nature in Taiwan is rich: other than b-boying, both popping and locking are huge and Taiwan remain international leaders in both. I appreciate what is growing out here, so I\u2019m not so worried about that (Shout out\u00a0[IP Dance Skool](http:\/\/www.stylehood.com.tw\/2012\/skool_01.html)!). Graffiti writers around the world are just a different breed of person. Although we're more aggressive in North America, they're different in a lot of similar ways if that makes sense, haha. The graff scene continues to grow and will only get better. Unfortunately though, DJs and rappers out here continue to get better but there's still a real lack of exposure to more music and so the variety is not as wide spanning as one would hope. What's played out here might not be my cup of tea generally, but I understand its place. We just need balance. That's it.\n\n**Something I\u2019ve noticed already is that streetwear has become really popular out here, and that\u2019s something strange to me because of what I\u2019ve seen in the Bay, like in San Jose where there\u2019s a vibrant dance community. It\u2019s like, these people can afford to dress like this without understanding what hip hop is.**\n\n[![](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/tumblr_mbxcacepFB1qm5r3ro1_r1_1280-1024x681.jpg)](http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/tumblr_mbxcacepFB1qm5r3ro1_r1_1280.jpg)\n\n [caption id=\"attachment_3649\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"][![Attendees of Fall\/Winter 2012 FAME (Fashion Art Music Exposition) in San Jose, California.

Mos Def [*btw now Yasiin Bey*] did something, talking about being in a country that is so driven by aesthetics, and how that's so incredible because Japan does so much to make things look pretty, the look is important. In Taiwan it's that as well to a different extent, I wouldn\u2019t say to a lesser extent, not lesser because you still have some very important artists coming out of Taiwan like Hou Hsiao Hsien or James Jean. He did [the wallpaper and fabric prints for] the Prada line in 2008, not sure if he's American-born or from Taiwan, but the aesthetic game for a portion of the population is very high. As a basis though, the problem you encounter in societies like this if everything is superficially based, or more aesthetically based, that's where you stop searching. Some of the music lacks soul. The music sounds right, aesthetically, but it just doesn\u2019t feel right. It didn't quite gel with me when I noticed it.\n\n [caption id=\"attachment_3651\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"][![Attendees at the March 2014 event with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah.

I did a tour around Asia with my good friends MAGNOLIUS (Toronto-based Hip-Hop group), back in \u201806, and that was the first time I\u2019d been back as an adult: last time I was back I was 11. I was able to experience a lot, since a lot had changed. Back home, for independent Asian rappers, we were doing okay, had day jobs, but you start to see a roof. When I began to see some of my more favored counterparts and colleagues get deals, some major label, but see them struggle, I thought I\u2019d give it a shot out here. I started going back and forth for several years, and three years ago finally made the move [to Taipei].<\/p>\r\n<strong>What's a regular day for LEO37 look like?<\/strong>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an independent artist, there's nothing regular. Nowadays, independent artists, they have hands in everything. They have to multi-task and be a lot more business minded. Pseudo-entrepreneurs if you will. My day-to-day, it depends. I do a lot of graphic design work, promotion: me and my two brothers (Howie and Tim) run PPF in Toronto and I have the Blast (Serpico, Poppa Baer and Oohchild) out here in Taipei. So it\u2019s different depending on the day.

Myself, I was always in the live music circle, I was never a club guy ever. [BLAST members] Poppa Baer and Serpico were spinning more in the clubs out here (as well as everywhere else), we added Oohchild later on, whose footprint in the street art community is extremely deep. Everyone had their foothold in different circles, and we tried to combine all our pros into something positive for the community.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to Serpico, we got started with Under Bridge that went on for almost a year [2012-2013], but then there was just a bunch of scheduling conflicts so we couldn't continue. It was like 150 to 300 kids every Sunday, while they got to hang out [and] listen to hip hop. The vibe that I got from that was what I got when I started. We had that for the kids. We did Nike summer nights, their first big streetball tournament in Taiwan, they had us take care of all the programming outside of the basketball. \u00a0It was amazing: five weeks, every week packed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3643\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"584\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3643\" alt=\"Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012  PC: The BLAST website\" src=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Nike-Summer-Nights-2012-1024x693.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a> Nike Summer Nights @ Ximending Movie Park, July to August 2012<br \/>PC: The BLAST website[\/caption]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you talk more about <em>Do You Want More<\/em>?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/59adCeahs6I?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" \/><\/object>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Do You Want More?<\/em> had a live band and guests, and it was hugely successful for everyone who went. We started to do them monthly, add more guests, do more covers, live remixes, classic hip hop, funk R&amp;B, the momentum kept going. It was the most successful live music event in Taiwan. We felt we kind of plateaued, so we changed it down to a quarterly event in order to make each one a little more special. DYWM became a cultural hub where you saw different cliques and scenes coming together to enjoy good live music. It\u2019s really a special event.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s crazy because when we brought Icy Ice of the Beat Junkies [<em>DJ crew formed in 1992 in Orange County<\/em>], he told us, <em>Yo it's crazy cuz the vibe you guys have here is what it felt like for us 15-20 years ago<\/em>. But here, the skill level isn't there yet, and it's absolutely not at the fault of the Taiwanese artists. It's still a new culture, they haven't heard enough. The new kids now who are coming into an environment where they've been listening to hip hop, they're catching it faster than the older guys who are trying to maintain, it\u2019s exciting.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What would you describe your style of music as?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s not hip hop, but it is hip hop. Because of the internet these days, regional hip-hop is less and less evident. So it just depends what you\u2019re around and what inspires you. You got people like ASAP Rocky who sound like Houston but are from New York. I mean, ASAP Rocky grew up in New York, but the Houston sound, that\u2019s what New York radio was playing. It was organic. For me, depending on the producers I\u2019m working with, wherever I am in the world, or what stage in my life I\u2019m at, that will influence what sound I create. \u00a0But I still like to think my work, no matter how far it gets, is still Hip-Hop.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the only Chinese kid in class, I didn\u2019t have rapper or DJ friends, I was an anomaly in my grade. But you know, while all the kids were listening to what they were, and I was listening the same things too, there\u2019s something about being a yellow kid in a pretty much white kids school [in that] hip hop just speaks to you. I was experiencing racism on a regular basis, maybe not outright but little slights here and there. I started getting an inkling of it, once I started touring outside Canada, I started to see\u2026but I truly believe there\u2019s no outright racism, it\u2019s ingrained. At the end of the day, I only had three role models in mainstream media growing up that looked like me: Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Dragon Ball Z. I was never a huge fan of Jackie just cause he, more often than not always ended up being a clown. And Dragon Ball Z is a cartoon. So you\u2019re telling me that the last real male role model that I related to cuturally was 40 years ago? And I wasn\u2019t really old enough for [Bruce Lee] to be my role model as a kid. It\u2019s a weird scenario when you grow up in a climate where there was no one Asian to look up to. The Asian performers I saw seemed real cheesy to me where I was, and that wasn\u2019t anything I wanted to be. I understand why people wouldn\u2019t identify with Asian rappers. Not saying my lyrics are Asian-driven but there\u2019s a perspective [the audience] doesn\u2019t have and needs to be able to identify with my music. So I don\u2019t blame anyone. But building and growing a career in Canada was tough. There are good Asian rappers really struggling in the States too, so it made sense that I came to Taiwan and test the waters.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What\u2019s a challenge you\u2019ve faced in coming to Taiwan?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/hEhwH4G_2PI?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" \/><\/object>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Language is still a problem, I don't speak it at a level that I need it to be. When I'm on stage, I wish I had more to say. I'm getting better. My banter is not that good, and I keep the shows tight cuz I don\u2019t say much. Rather than show my weaknesses, I just push my strengths. The fact that I don't rap in Chinese and refuse to (until it\u2019s at the level of my English) restricts my reach, so I promote and tour always with a band, because at least people can understand music and feeling, you [can] get that. For me, being out here, not only in Taiwan but being in Asia, with the exception of Singapore and the Philippines, everywhere else that doesn\u2019t speak English has forced me to step my stage game up. The challenge keeps things interesting.<\/p>\r\n<strong>Would you say that Taiwan is still in the early stage of its hip hop scene?<\/strong>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is an early stage in Taiwan for hip hop: if hip hop started in 1976 or \u201878 in the US, then in Taiwan we\u2019re in the late 80s right now. [Rappers here] are starting to rap more about things they care about, rather than just being cool at the party, so that\u2019s refreshing, but it\u2019s still in its early stages.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3648\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnyc.org\/story\/89709-south-bronx-hip-hop-year-zero\/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3648 \" alt=\"Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club PC: Joe Conzo\/WNYC\" src=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Hip-hop-in-the-Bronx-at-the-Dixie-Club.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Hip hop in the Bronx at the Dixie Club.<br \/>PC: Joe Conzo\/WNYC[\/caption]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Of course, hip hop is more than just rapping. How has the reception been for the other elements like DJing, graffiti, and break-dancing?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dance by nature in Taiwan is rich: other than b-boying, both popping and locking are huge and Taiwan remain international leaders in both. I appreciate what is growing out here, so I\u2019m not so worried about that (Shout out\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.stylehood.com.tw\/2012\/skool_01.html\">IP Dance Skool<\/a>!). Graffiti writers around the world are just a different breed of person. Although we're more aggressive in North America, they're different in a lot of similar ways if that makes sense, haha. The graff scene continues to grow and will only get better. Unfortunately though, DJs and rappers out here continue to get better but there's still a real lack of exposure to more music and so the variety is not as wide spanning as one would hope. What's played out here might not be my cup of tea generally, but I understand its place. We just need balance. That's it.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Something I\u2019ve noticed already is that streetwear has become really popular out here, and that\u2019s something strange to me because of what I\u2019ve seen in the Bay, like in San Jose where there\u2019s a vibrant dance community.

He got the cocked back cap, G\u2019d up, and I hit him up to go to a hip hop show, and he told me, \u201cI don\u2019t really listen to hip hop.\u201d And that was it. Mos Def [<em>btw now Yasiin Bey<\/em>] did something, talking about being in a country that is so driven by aesthetics, and how that's so incredible because Japan does so much to make things look pretty, the look is important. In Taiwan it's that as well to a different extent, I wouldn\u2019t say to a lesser extent, not lesser because you still have some very important artists coming out of Taiwan like Hou Hsiao Hsien or James Jean. He did [the wallpaper and fabric prints for] the Prada line in 2008, not sure if he's American-born or from Taiwan, but the aesthetic game for a portion of the population is very high. As a basis though, the problem you encounter in societies like this if everything is superficially based, or more aesthetically based, that's where you stop searching. Some of the music lacks soul. The music sounds right, aesthetically, but it just doesn\u2019t feel right. It didn't quite gel with me when I noticed it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3651\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"680\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/hardboiled.berkeley.edu\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/ik20140319-_dsc2855-006-the-blast-x-arta-present-raekwon-and-ghostface-killah.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3651\" alt=\"Attendees at the March 2014 event with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah.

That\u2019s a hard question. As far as race goes, although I\u2019m half white and half Korean, I\u2019ve always identified a lot more with my Korean side because when people first see me, they can tell that I\u2019m not entirely white, and it makes me feel like, \u201cOh yeah, because I\u2019m Korean.\u201d *Has your identity caused you difficulties growing up?* When i was younger, I wasn\u2019t really sure. Maybe throughout high school and middle school, there would always be a group of kids that were Korean that would always sit together, and then a few times I would hang out with them, but I felt like i couldn\u2019t be fully included because I was only half Korean. But then again, my Korean side is a huge part of me, so it\u2019s something i have to embrace as well. And I don\u2019t see a ton of people, especially growing up, I didn\u2019t see a ton of people who were half Korean and half white, or even half Asian at all because I went through private schooling, and it was primarily white middle class families who went through, and not seeing other people who looked like me, or who related to me racially exactly the same way, made it kind of hard to identify with a particular person. *Weirdest shit someone has said to you as someone who\u2019s mixed?* Oh man. Someone sincerely asked if I was from North Korea, and playing along I was like \u201cyeah my mom came over on little raft with her family\u201d and they believed me? I guess that was one of the weirdest things because that\u2019s not really possible.\n\n**James Morris | 3rd year, Junior Transfer***How do you identify?* Black and Filipino. *Has your identity caused you difficulties growing up?* When I was about, I think, elementary school, I was actually bullied because I went to a predominantly Hispanic school, and I don\u2019t look African American? And some of the Black kids said I acted white, like \u201cwhite washed\u201d, and then I was never accepted by the Hispanic kids and there weren\u2019t a lot of Asian kids, and people said I was confused, and I didn\u2019t belong anywhere necessarily. And it hurt, but as I grew up I just accepted it and I\u2019m like, \u201cyo, I\u2019m cool\u201d. *What challenges do you face as someone who is of mixed descent?* Like I stated before, people saying that I don\u2019t belong with one race, or that I don\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d. When people make racist comments about one of my races and I bring it up with them, they kind of just blow it off like, \u201coh you\u2019re only half, so it doesn\u2019t really count, you shouldn\u2019t be offended\u201d, but I am offended because that\u2019s part of who I am. So that\u2019s definitely the biggest thing that I\u2019ve encountered. But being of mixed race, I think it\u2019s more rewarding as opposed to challenging.\n\n**Kaitlin Harvey | 1st year, Freshman***How do you identify?* As a person of mixed heritage, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m fully American or fully Filipino, so i would say that I\u2019m Filipino American.. *Do you identify with one race more than another?* I probably say I\u2019d identify more with the American culture because i lijve in the United States. [I identify more as an American than a Filipino] because when I visited the Philippines i felt more like an outsider and i couldn\u2019t identify strictly as Filipino, and when i identify as an American, that\u2019s more of a multicultural mix kind of thing. You can\u2019t just describe Americans as just being white anymore. It\u2019s more of a mixed cultural thing, and I feel like that\u2019s where I belong. *Has your identity caused you difficulties growing up?* I would say yes just because when you tell people, \u201cI\u2019m half white, half Filipino\u201d, they\u2019re like, \u201cbut what are you really\u201d?

Low representation of such groups is apparent across other UCs, CSUs, and community colleges up and down the state of California. As demonstrated by these statistics, students of color face systemic barriers to gaining access to higher education. Senate Constitution Amendment 5 (SCA 5), an initiative that would ask voters to enable the consideration of race, sex, color, ethnicity, and or national origin in recruitment, admission and retention programs in California\u2019s public colleges and universities, would be one of several necessary steps to improving the accessibility of higher education to under-resourced communities of color. The problem of inaccessibility to higher education runs much deeper than the mere process of recruiting and admitting junior and senior high school students of color to universities and colleges. The problem of inaccessibility to higher education for low-income folks of color starts from birth. It starts with being born into a lifetime of systemic discrimination, in which a complex web of internalized, interpersonal, institutional and structural racism keep low-income communities of color trapped in cycles of poverty and exclusion. One such example at the structural level is the school-to-prison pipeline, in which crumbling, underfunded public K-12 schools punish youth of color and funnel them into jails, instead of preparing them for entering higher education. Over the past 50 years, the interplay between California\u2019s divestment from K-12 education, a fundamental vessel for youth of color to attain socio-economic mobility, and California\u2019s investment in the criminal justice system, a punitive system that disproportionately incarcerates Black, Latino and Southeast Asian male youth, has disenfranchised youth of color from making it to higher education. Certainly, affirmative action does not fix such root racial injustices that ultimately produce disparities in racial representation in education. With that said, affirmative action is one of many necessary measures needed to move in that direction, particularly in its ability to bring racial justice into public conversation. Additionally, the explicit consideration of race in higher education admissions enables admissions officers to gain a more holistic understanding of a candidate\u2019s efforts in high school, efforts that do not traditionally fall within the purview of admission criteria designed for white and economically privileged students. Aside from the fact that standardized test scores and subsequent performance in college have limited correlation, test scores are an inadequate measure of merit for students who lack access to quality public education or who lack the funds for preparatory courses for those tests. The consideration of race in admissions would give credit to the characteristics and skills uniquely developed by underserved students of color: the discipline from working a daily minimum wage job after school; the quick learning demonstrated by performing in English, a second language for many Californians; and even the ability to bring a critical understanding of social structures to academia due to first-hand experience with marginalization. As demonstrated by these examples, it is false to say that students \u201cadmitted because of affirmative action\u201d would be unprepared for the rigor of higher education. A few powerful Chinese American advocacy groups have recently contended that affirmative action would impose reverse discrimination on Asian Americans, the largest racial group in the UC system, by placing Black, Latino and Native American students in the seats of equally or more deserving Asian American students. A small group of powerful Chinese-American advocacy groups, who were lobbied by Republican lawmakers, even pressured certain California Assembly Members into halting a vote on SCA 5 out of this fear. More details... The recent coverage of the Chinese American base in California and its power in halting SCA 5 skews the narrative of Asian American opinions and advocacy on SCA 5. The majority of Asian American advocacy groups support affirmative action. These include Chinese for Affirmative Action, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Asian Law Center, Southeast Asia Resource Center (SEARAC), UC Asian American & Pacific Islander Policy Multicampus Research program (AAPI Policy MRP), National Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islander Research in Education (CARE), and Hmong Innovating Politics (HIP). Additionally, when Proposition 209 was on the ballot, the majority of Asian American voters opposed banning affirmative action. Even this publication, hardboiled: APA newsmagazine, was formed in 1996 in reaction to Proposition 209 to present pro-affirmative action opinion in the UC Berkeley API community. Furthermore, the majority of Asian Americans opposed banning affirmative action when Proposition 209 was on the ballot. As a South Asian American immigrant from the Silicon Valley who attended a high performing public high school that channels nearly 50 API students a year to UC Berkeley, I am the prototype of the Asian American student that opponents of SCA 5 claim would rejected from UC Berkeley. Yet, I am strongly in support of SCA 5. The Asian Americans in opposition to SCA 5 have the facts wrong: affirmative action helps Asian Americans. Asian American advocacy groups have been fighting for decades to improve accessibility of higher education for Asian Americans, and SCA 5 would continue that legacy. In the 1970s, Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) fought for and won the rights of thousands of Chinese-speaking students in public schools in Lau v. Nichols in 1974. In the 1980s and as recently as 2008, CAA fought against University of California policies that are discriminatory or biased against Asian Americans. CAA has also defeated efforts by California State University (CSU) to deny access to predominantly immigrant students who have needed English assistance. CAA has also prevailed over the special interests who sought to stop the Chinatown campus of City College of San Francisco that now serves 8,000 immigrant and working class students. SCA 5 would help more Asian Americans enter California\u2019s public higher education system. Many Asian Americans, especially those from working class, refugee, or related backgrounds, have significantly lower rates of higher education attainment. Moreover, Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders, Native Hawaiians, working class East Asians, and other Asian American subgroups are underrepresented in the UC and would be beneficiaries of race-conscious admissions policies. Furthermore, affirmative action benefits every student. The quality and experience of higher education will improve for every Asian American student if there is a more diverse student body. A more diverse student body will enable Asian American students to think more critically by hearing a wider variety of perspectives on the topics they engage with in and outside of the classroom.\n\n\n","html":"by disha banik\r\n\r\nIn Fall 2012, UC Berkeley\u2019s student body comprised less than 14% Latinos, 7% Southeast Asian, 4% Afrikan Americans\/Blacks, 1% Native Americans, 0.002% Pacific Islanders, and similarly low percentages for other underrepresented racial communities.

Just a day later, a friend messaged me frantically: \u201cIs this true?\u201d She asked me, \u201cIs such a racist bill being passed?\u201d The bill in question? Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 5, more commonly called SCA5. Introduced by California State Senator Edward Hernandez, the bill actually isn\u2019t so elaborate or sinister. SCA5 simply proposes deleting two provisions from Proposition 209, which was passed in 1996 to eliminate affirmative action in all California government institutions, including the UC system. The removal of these two provisions would allow the UC system to once again consider sex, race, and ethnicity in the admission process. But an outpour of opposition to SCA5, which deemed the bill as \u201cracist,\u201d rendered the bill dead for the year by March.\n\n It\u2019s pretty hard to ignore the role of APIs in this debate. The media, if anything, makes it impossible. Indeed, it was the Asian-American Caucus that called for the tabling of SCA5 in March. In reality, polls reflect that Asian Americans are about evenly split about affirmative action, as reported by The New York Times. But the most vocal opponents (and definitely the most widely reported) are Chinese Americans, many of whom live in the Silicon Valley and San Gabriel Valley. Incidentally, the Silicon Valley is my home\u2013and yes, most of my high school classmates are against affirmative action. I should say at this point that I support affirmative action and SCA5, but that growing up, I was taught by my parents and my community that affirmative action was a form of discrimination against middle-class Asian Americans like ourselves. Also regrettably present in the dialogue are, as Patrick covers in his article, anti-Black and anti-Latino sentiment, sentiment that I saw very much reflected in the anti-SCA5 Facebook pages and petitions and letters that I read online. One Asian American student on the \u201cSay No to SCA5\u201d described the \u201cnon-asian, non-IB\u201d students as lazy and unmotivated and call out SCA5 as \u201ca stupid racist bill that is trying to make it harder for those who work hard and put all their effort into college to get into college and easier for those who don\u2019t care to get in.\u201d It\u2019s rhetoric I heard often as I grew up and the same rhetoric used in today\u2019s debate about SCA5 and more abstractly, affirmative action.\n\n No, this is not a sign that Asian Americans are \u201ctaking a turn for the political right,\u201d as a Los Angeles Times op-ed suggested. These anti-affirmative action sentiment has existed, even in the decidedly liberal second-generation Asian American students in the Bay Area. So why? To be completely honest, it has been something I have had to grapple with since coming to college and joining **hardboiled** \u2013 trying to bridge what I believed before to what I know now.\n\n After the passage of Prop 209, UCLA and UC Berkeley\u2019s Asian American population grew by 19% and 28% respectively, according to a study. Break those numbers down and you will find that these increases are largely in the numbers of middle-class Asian Americans admitted. Yes, affirmative action does hurt middle-class East Asian admission in top colleges, including Ivy Leagues, which many have accused of having de facto Asian American race quotas. In many private elite colleges, Asian American admissions have stagnated at around 16%, after dramatic increases in the last 20 years, despite the fact Asian Americans are among the fastest growing communities in the United States. While it\u2019s hard to find statistics to back it up, it was common knowledge growing up that you had to score higher and do more than white applicants to be considered for these schools, and much of the resentment has stemmed from this feeling of unfairness. But the resentment is unfairly leveled towards other communities of color, when the blame should be going towards an inherently racist system of admissions that ultimately discriminates against all minority groups. Opponents call SCA5 racist, even ironically quoting from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s famous \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech, but what they ignore is the systemic racism that still exists in our society. Many opponents of SCA5 see affirmative action as giving some a \u201cfree pass\u201d without recognizing the barriers that many students of color must overcome for the opportunity of higher education.\n\n All this clamoring has also essentially invisibilized the work of many API groups for SCA5 as well as the necessity for affirmative action for many Asian American groups. While communities like the Chinese Americans are often deemed over-represented in elite colleges, many API communities are in fact severely underrepresented: 65.8% of Cambodian, 66.5% of Laotian, 63.2% of Hmong, and 51.1% of Vietnamese Americans have never gotten a college degree, among the highest rates of any minority groups. But, as long as different communities fight against each other rather than side-by-side, nothing will get done. That goes for communities within the API umbrella, as well. There is often a sense of us versus them \u2013 those who organize for radical change and those who prefer the status quo. But as someone whose roots are from a community from which much of the opposition is coming from, it is impossible for me to draw such a hard line.\n\n It reminds me of a discussion about the model minority myth that I had in a class. Many middle-class Asian Americans failed to see the negative impact of the stereotype, arguing that they \u201cfit the description anyway.\u201d But the truth is, the model minority myth is incredibly detrimental to all Asian Americans, even as it affects different communities in different ways. For underserved Asian American communities, it creates unrealistic expectations, invisibilizes their need for federal and societal assistance, and often excludes them from conversations about affirmative action despite their need for it. For the Asian Americans \u201cwho fit it anyway,\u201d it is equally harmful. Growing up, I too internalized these stereotypes, the daughter of an engineer aspiring towards higher education, and it wasn\u2019t until much later I recognized how it affected my self-esteem and self-perception. It\u2019s often said that the model minority myth creates racial barriers between the Asian American community and other communities of color, but in the same way, it creates a division between more and less socioeconomically privileged Asian American communities. It was this recognition that allowed me to understand the greater context in which SCA5 exists\u2013that all students of color are functioning in a racist systems of admissions that limit admission for all minority communities. The fight against SCA5 is short-sighted, but I believe it\u2019s important to acknowledge the different stances and different ways affirmative action affects our communities. In the end, we should all be exploring ways to create a fairer system of admissions for all.\n\n\n","html":"by katherine wang\r\n\r\nA few months ago, I opened my email to find a very urgent Change.org petition decrying a bill that would create race quotas for Asian America students in the University of California public school system. Just a day later, a friend messaged me frantically: \u201cIs this true?\u201d She asked me, \u201cIs such a racist bill being passed?\u201d The bill in question? Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 5, more commonly called SCA5. Introduced by California State Senator Edward Hernandez, the bill actually isn\u2019t so elaborate or sinister. SCA5 simply proposes deleting two provisions from Proposition 209, which was passed in 1996 to eliminate affirmative action in all California government institutions, including the UC system. The removal of these two provisions would allow the UC system to once again consider sex, race, and ethnicity in the admission process. But an outpour of opposition to SCA5, which deemed the bill as \u201cracist,\u201d rendered the bill dead for the year by March.<p>\r\nIt\u2019s pretty hard to ignore the role of APIs in this debate. The media, if anything, makes it impossible. Indeed, it was the Asian-American Caucus that called for the tabling of SCA5 in March. In reality, polls reflect that Asian Americans are about evenly split about affirmative action, as reported by The New York Times. But the most vocal opponents (and definitely the most widely reported) are Chinese Americans, many of whom live in the Silicon Valley and San Gabriel Valley. Incidentally, the Silicon Valley is my home\u2013and yes, most of my high school classmates are against affirmative action. I should say at this point that I support affirmative action and SCA5, but that growing up, I was taught by my parents and my community that affirmative action was a form of discrimination against middle-class Asian Americans like ourselves. Also regrettably present in the dialogue are, as Patrick covers in his article, anti-Black and anti-Latino sentiment, sentiment that I saw very much reflected in the anti-SCA5 Facebook pages and petitions and letters that I read online. One Asian American student on the \u201cSay No to SCA5\u201d described the \u201cnon-asian, non-IB\u201d students as lazy and unmotivated and call out SCA5 as \u201ca stupid racist bill that is trying to make it harder for those who work hard and put all their effort into college to get into college and easier for those who don\u2019t care to get in.\u201d It\u2019s rhetoric I heard often as I grew up and the same rhetoric used in today\u2019s debate about SCA5 and more abstractly, affirmative action.<p>\r\nNo, this is not a sign that Asian Americans are \u201ctaking a turn for the political right,\u201d as a Los Angeles Times op-ed suggested. These anti-affirmative action sentiment has existed, even in the decidedly liberal second-generation Asian American students in the Bay Area. So why? To be completely honest, it has been something I have had to grapple with since coming to college and joining <strong>hardboiled<\/strong> \u2013 trying to bridge what I believed before to what I know now.<p>\r\nAfter the passage of Prop 209, UCLA and UC Berkeley\u2019s Asian American population grew by 19% and 28% respectively, according to a study. Break those numbers down and you will find that these increases are largely in the numbers of middle-class Asian Americans admitted.

To provide for her family in a war-stricken setting, Kim says that she had no choice to take on the job. Soon, she found herself in a boat to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. She was being sent to serve as a sex slave in \u201ccomfort station\u201d to serve soldiers in the Japanese Imperial Army.\n\n In honor of women like Kim, the city council of Glendale voted and approved a statue to be placed in Central Park. The Korean Sister City Association paid nearly $30,000 to make a replica of a memorial that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. Few months later, the statue was shipped from Korea and make its way to a new home in Glendale, now a city which has a Korean American population of 5%.\n\n From the onset of the city\u2019s decision, there has been a lot of controversy about whether or not the statue is giving a misleading account of what happened during WWII. A lawsuit was filed in February pleading that the City of Glendale remove the statue. Some of the opponents deny that the Japanese Imperial Army ran brothels altogether and claim that the women voluntarily and willingly served as prostitutes. They hold on to this version of history even though a former Prime Minister of Japan issued an apology in the 1990s and despite that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs refers on its website to women who were \u201cdeprived of their freedom and had to endure misery.\u201d This conservative view, while a minority opinion, is nevertheless troubling because it is held by several city council members in Glendale\u2019s sister city in Japan called Higashiosaka. For the past several years, Glendale and Higashiosaka have maintained a close political tie with each other. In the past, for instance, they have had sports games for children from these two cities and a foreign exchange program for students.\n\n This gives way for the first and strongest argument held by Japanese American plaintiffs in the ongoing lawsuit. Two individual plaintiffs and a corporation (GAHT-US) alleged in their petition, the Glendale comfort women statue \u201cexceeds the power of Glendale, infringes upon the federal government\u2019s power to exclusively conduct the foreign affairs of the United States and violate the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. From their point of view, the Statue of a Girl of Peace is a divisive figure in international relations\u2014it is weakening the triadic relationship between the United States, Japan, and South Korea.\n\n However, what they fail to see is how the statue can perform just its opposite\u2014it can strengthen these bonds and unite communities. They fail to consider how if conservative Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans accept that this event in history happened, the Girl of Peace can help repair past wrongdoings, save them from falling into historical amnesia, and help prevent similar acts of violence in the future. While the plaintiffs see a divisive figure, I see the possibility of a uniting figure from the same evidence that they provide in their argument. The argument of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit takes a different turn when they make another allegation that they have been personally affected by the statue on an individual basis. Gingery says that she can no longer enjoy Central Park and suffers from \u201cfeelings of exclusion, discomfort, and anger\u201d whenever she sees the statue. Her argument, however, does not seem to hold when we look at how former comfort women such as Kim had to live with \u201cfeelings of exclusion, discomfort, and anger\u201d whenever they were reminded by memories of a troubled and tragic past. If the principle by which the merits of this lawsuit is to be judged is indeed to what extent people suffered from \u201cfeelings of exclusion, discomfort, and anger,\u201d then the premises that the plaintiffs advance in support of their argument can be turned against them to weaken, rather than strengthen, their conclusion. For, surely, a person who passes by a statue in a park who did not suffer any wartime atrocities suffer less than a person who had to endure years of sexual abuse and post-traumatic stress.\n\n While I think the statue should stay, in the beginning of this story I began with a discussion of the history of comfort women because the broader significance of this debate involves power dynamics that tries to control how certain historical accounts get told and how some do not. By controlling which version of history gets (re)told, states and individuals are constructing a very specific account of how the history surrounding WWII gets structured. Thus, the controversy of the statue is ultimately about a fight for power, masked in the rhetoric of federal government\u2019s power to conduct international affairs, of individual traumatic experience, and of outright denial. Gingery v. City of Glendale also touches on powerful corporate interests that benefit from denying due rights of humanity. It is about how much the Asian American community can address a painful history and whether or not this version of history will be a lesson that will be taught to future generations.\n\n\n","html":"by rora oh\r\n\r\nBok-dong Kim, an 88-year old activist, helped to take down the purple drape covering a 1,100-pound statue on July 30th of this year.

While it would be amazing if whitewashing and erasure were to end, it is just not possible. As an Asian American, I recognize that there is a certain way the public thinks of us. I mean, we are usually portrayed as the villains, the \u201cmodel minority,\u201d or nerdy, socially awkward, or both, and so on. This will probably never change and, you know what, I accept that. I accept that there will always be prejudice in this world. There will always be a preset way that the mainstream media will present a group and it cannot be changed. However, that does not mean we cannot or will not call the media out when bullshit misrepresentation or demonization of a group occurs. With that said, I want to talk about two recent films that have caught my attention: TMNT, which suffered from whitewashing, and Cesar Chavez, which suffered from erasure. Now before people start throwing hate at me, no, I\u2019m not criticizing the TMNT franchise or Cesar Chavez and his accomplishments. I love TMNT, and I respect Cesar Chavez. What I\u2019m criticizing is how they were adapted to the big screen. Let us start with TMNT. The issue here was the casting of William Fichtner (a white man) playing the role of Oroku Saki (who is Japanese), otherwise known as The Shredder. Instead of Oroku, Shredder has been transformed into a man named Eric Sachs, a character whose name is infinitely less cool than Oroku Saki with an uninteresting backstory to boot. Why the change? Because Hollywood and Michael Bay willed it. Now with Cesar Chavez, although it is understandable that Chavez has to be the focus, the fact that the role of Filipino Americans and Larry Itliong, the co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, has been downplayed to the point that their role in the movie was negligible is a disservice to Filipinos, to Chavez\u2019s memory, and everyone who was a part of the movement. There was no reason Larry Itliong could not have been a major character in the movie, and yet the makers decided to turn him into just a face in the crowd. What we have here are two different problems: whitewashing and erasure. With whitewashing, it tells us many things depending on how you view whitewashing. Could it be that the studios were trying to throw Asians a bone by not having the movie\u2019s main villain be an Asian man? Most likely not. In fact, what whitewashing is really telling me is that people don\u2019t want to see Asians on screen. There is history to back this, ranging from not having Jet Li kiss Aaliyah in Romeo Must Die due to negative audience reaction, to the movie 21, a movie with white actors playing characters based on Asians. It\u2019s hard enough for Asians to get main roles so whenever an Asian character is whitewashed, there is definitely a lost opportunity. And just to be clear, Michael Bay or whoever is in charge of casting for TMNT has no excuse since the original Shredder was played by James Saito, a Japanese actor. If the original movies could adapt the source material faithfully, then the new movie has no argument. As for erasure, it says that our history is not important, that it could easily be left out since it\u2019s not the story they want to tell, or they just don\u2019t want it as part of their story. Filipinos are hugely underrepresented in history to begin with, so leaving Filipinos out of a story in which they were heavily involved in is problematic. I\u2019m not trying to say Cesar Chavez should have been about Filipinos, but Filipinos should have been a major presence in the film since it\u2019s historically correct. So no, Diego Luna, your excuse that it\u2019s just \u201cmovie-making,\u201d that erasure had to happen in order to fit your vision, does not work. You wanted to make a movie about Cesar Chavez so by taking on that task, it became your responsibility to create a movie that did the man and his movement justice. By erasing the importance of half of the group that was in the United Farm Workers (the group was a merger between a Filipino and Mexican group) and turning Larry Itliong, a man who was a leader and actually marched alongside Chavez, into just another supporter, is troublesome. The fact that this movie did attract a lot of attention makes this problem even worse since people who have no knowledge of the UFW will likely take the movie on its word. While I only chose two examples for this topic, there are plenty more pieces of media that can be picked apart. Whitewashing and erasure won\u2019t go away; that\u2019s something we all have to accept. However, we should not have to stand for it.

Not trying to get all sentimental and shit, given that I technically have one more semester, but at this point in my life, I can\u2019t help but reflect on how much change has occurred within the community for which I have grown to care deeply. The trajectory of my growth as an Asian American student activist very much reflects the shifting landscape of Asian American grassroots organizing through the generations, at least at Berkeley: more and more, the movement becomes increasingly diverse and yet frustratingly divided. Here, as a last-ditch effort to impart some knowledge, I reflect on the lessons I\u2019ve learned from being involved in multiple on-campus spaces. Let me first establish that I am not and will never be an authority on Asian American activism. I have only been doing this \u201cactivism\u201d thing for two years, and I don\u2019t feel confident in even claiming myself to be an activist or organizer. I have my criticisms of the spaces I\u2019ve been in, of course, and I will defend every word of this article to the letter, but I acknowledge that I am speaking from only my point of view. Whew, got that out of the way. From my jaded point of view, the API community has made little progress this past academic year in moving towards rebuilding a coalition that serves as an umbrella group for all API-identified student groups. The model that folks have been striving towards and trying to reconstruct is the Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC), founded in January 2007 and inactive since spring semester 2012. As someone who only knew APAC in its dying days, I can see how the disengagement of API student groups stems from a conflict of politics. I\u2019m talking specifically about the folks who identify somewhere on the spectrum of progressive, liberal, radical, etc. Whatever the demographics of the more progressive-leaning API communities, what cannot be denied is the growing depoliticization of student groups across the campus. Depoliticized in the sense that the term \u201cAsian American,\u201d first coined in the late 1960s by UC Berkeley history grad student Yuji Ichioka, has declined in usage because it doesn\u2019t include Pacific Islanders, thus the more popular label \u201cAPI.\u201d Depoliticized in the sense that we have grown more reactive in our short-lived campaigns, from the eyelid surgery ad in Daily Cal last semester to the UCLA\/USC flier and SCA5 controversies this semester. I have the privilege of being East Asian and therefore a benefactor of neo\/colonialism in some sense, but I question whether the inclusivity we claim in a label gets put into practice. **hardboiled** itself should not be spared from this scrutiny, since we proudly call ourselves the APA newsmagazine when none of us identify as Pacific Islander or have lived anywhere in the Pacific Islands nor do we cover PI issues extensively. While I do think folks have a general awareness of how Pacific Islanders have been marginalized on-campus, there still hasn\u2019t been a deeper analysis of how the 1.2 million Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders accounted for the 2010 Census continue to cope with the legacy of genocide and militarization in the United States. Yes, race is a social construct that shapes our lived realities, and yes, no word in English will ever be inclusive of all our identities, so we have to move away from being politically correct because we live in an already colonized and colonizing nation, and we reproduce colonizing attitudes among each other. I would argue that folks need to avoid becoming too attached to using \u201cAsian American\u201d or \u201cAsian Pacific Islander\u201d because we need to invest more energy into identifying what narratives of oppression we share and most importantly, where we differ and can support one another. At our own campus, this means taking a hard look at ways in which APIs neglect issues directly affecting the Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South Asian community despite including them in our conferences and despite much of the similar work our spaces do in catering to ethnic-specific needs. This means identifying issues of gender, disability, citizenship status, and other intersectional identities. This means orienting ourselves back into being unapologetically political, and even radical: now that the spaces and services fought for and won by previous generations have become institutionalized, how can we continue to hold the administration and ourselves accountable while also building up our own capacities to succeed as students? Often we invoke memories of the Third World Liberation Front, waxing poetic about the key figures involved in the establishment of Ethnic Studies at SF State College and Berkeley. This not only leaves out the work of student activists at community colleges like Merritt College in Oakland where the Black Panthers were born, but also privileges UC students as the leaders who will initiate social change. We are quick to draw a line connecting the Asian American movement of the 60s and 70s to the formation of API student spaces that cater to a broader spectrum of the community than ever before. Yet when we analyze the politics of these student groups now and compare them to the politics of students then, there has been a watering down of the radical language that used to dominate the demands put forth by students of color. For example, the Asian American Political Alliance that Yuji Ichioka and Emma Gee started in their apartment during May 1968 became known for their work in the ongoing civil rights and Black Power movements alongside the anti-war protests that spread nationwide. From the October 1969 issue of AAPA\u2019s newspaper, here\u2019s an excerpt of what it stands for: \u201cAAPA is only a transition for developing our own social identity, a multiplication of efforts. In fact, AAPA itself is not the important link but the ideas generated into action from it\u2014that we Asian Americans are no longer going to kowtow to white America in order to gain an ounce of respect; that we must begin to build our own society alongside our black, brown and red brothers as well as those whites willing to effect fundamental social, economic, political changes; that we have the right for determining our own lives and asserting our yellow identity as a positive force in a new life based on human relationships and cooperation.\u201d Contrast that with the mission statement of APAC, most recently revised in 2010: \u201cTo actively foster and sustain an inclusive APA representative coalition space that reflects and addresses tensions in issues facing member and affiliate communities through action, programming, and general solidarity.\u201d Contrast again with **hardboiled**\u2019s mission statement: \u201c**hardboiled**\u00a0newsmagazine seeks to empower the Asian Pacific American (APA) community by raising awareness and initiating discussion regarding APA issues in an inclusive space.\u00a0hardboiled\u00a0aims to be a vehicle for activism by providing an APA perspective and exposing issues affecting the APA community through the bold voices that prevail in our publication.\u201d Hardly a representative sample of all the API progressive organizations in Berkeley\u2019s history, these snippets speak volumes about the shift in political agenda from the start of the Asian American movement up until today. Oddly enough, at an institution like Berkeley where many of the resources like the Multicultural Community Center were fought for by students of color, more and more students have to conform to bureaucratic structures like the ASUC in order to access funds and services to support their respective organizations. Do not mistake me, I respect the work that students do in the ASUC, and as a body the ASUC empowers students to be in decision-making positions. I just do not believe much change can be affected outside of an institution from within an institution. No matter what kind of rhetoric we use in our mission statements today, whether we use first person plural or third person, we have to acknowledge that our survival and resistance are inherently political and therefore necessary for us to navigate outside of the Berkeley bubble. All of this goes to say, to paraphrase Mia Mingus\u2019 keynote speech at APIICON this year, we have to shift our desires as a community to want the challenging and difficult things. For me, this shift comes in the form of allyship. Allyship means learning to speak each other\u2019s language, but first learning how to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d Allyship means showing up and staying until the end, no matter how hard things gets, especially when things get hard. Allyship means you commit your everyday thoughts to reflecting on how you give space and agency to those directly affected by forms of oppression you may have unintentionally committed. Allyship means identifying and addressing the source of hurt rather than dismissing the hurt itself. Let\u2019s really put our allyship into practice, because no movement leaves people behind.\n\n\n","html":"by sam lai\r\n\r\nOver the course of my four years here at UC Berkeley, I have been involved in a dozen student organizations, ranging from the cultural to political.

Today, it continues to be an important network of support for Pilipinos and Pilipino American s, hosting programs such as the annual Pilipino Cultural Night and the Kuya\/Ate\/Ading mentorship program, which pairs Kuyas (big brothers) and Ates (big sisters) with underclassmen mentees that share similar career interests, majors, or personalities. Beyond the UC Berkeley campus, PAA also regularly participates in the Friendship Games at CSU Fullerton, an event that brings together hundreds of Pilipino students across California to compete in picnic games and to socialize with each other to promote spirit, pride, unity, and friendship. Every year, PAA hosts two general meetings per semester that explore issues surrounding the Pilipino and Pilipino American community, including immigration, identity, and culture. As the oldest Pilipino organization on campus, PAA is very much integrated within the Pilipino community and open to all students, regardless of ethnicity. Although it is hard to estimate the exact number of PAA\u2019s members because of this, more than a hundred students participate in PAA\u2019s many programs every year. At the heart of PAA is its coordinating committee of fifteen. Marie Joyce Artap, one of PAA\u2019s Executive Co-Chairs, learned about the organization through the Pilipino-American Student Orientation (PASO), an event held by PASS (Pilipino Academic Student Services) in collaboration with the six other Pilipino organizations on campus, and knew immediately that she wanted to be a part of PCN. \u201cThis organization is very much made for the community by the community. We are also able to engage in our rich cultural identity and history, while discussing and thinking critically about our place in the Pilipino Community, on the UC Berkeley campus, and in the context of the greater Pilipino\/Pilipino-American community that extends past the boundaries of UC Berkeley,\u201d she said when asked what she loved most. \u201cPAA is really a space to make your own, and this is what has allowed me to gravitate toward it for the past four years.\u201d Corrina Calanoc, PAA\u2019s Social Co-Chair, echoed the sentiment. \u201cI love how PAA can make anyone feel welcome, regardless of major, post-grad plans, or ethnicity,\u201d Corrina said. Interested in being a part of PAA? From interning for PAA to participating in its programs, there are many ways students can be involved with the organization. PAA also hosts meetings and events throughout the year. On May 3rd, PAA will be having its 45th Anniversary & End-of-The-Year Banquet and collaborating with SASC to host SASCerade\/PCN After-PAArty at night!

Beyond the UC Berkeley campus, PAA also regularly participates in the Friendship Games at CSU Fullerton, an event that brings together hundreds of Pilipino students across California to compete in picnic games and to socialize with each other to promote spirit, pride, unity, and friendship.\r\n\r\nEvery year, PAA hosts two general meetings per semester that explore issues surrounding the Pilipino and Pilipino American community, including immigration, identity, and culture. As the oldest Pilipino organization on campus, PAA is very much integrated within the Pilipino community and open to all students, regardless of ethnicity. Although it is hard to estimate the exact number of PAA\u2019s members because of this, more than a hundred students participate in PAA\u2019s many programs every year.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of PAA is its coordinating committee of fifteen. Marie Joyce Artap, one of PAA\u2019s Executive Co-Chairs, learned about the organization through the Pilipino-American Student Orientation (PASO), an event held by PASS (Pilipino Academic Student Services) in collaboration with the six other Pilipino organizations on campus, and knew immediately that she wanted to be a part of PCN. \u201cThis organization is very much made for the community by the community. We are also able to engage in our rich cultural identity and history, while discussing and thinking critically about our place in the Pilipino Community, on the UC Berkeley campus, and in the context of the greater Pilipino\/Pilipino-American community that extends past the boundaries of UC Berkeley,\u201d she said when asked what she loved most. \u201cPAA is really a space to make your own, and this is what has allowed me to gravitate toward it for the past four years.\u201d\r\n\r\nCorrina Calanoc, PAA\u2019s Social Co-Chair, echoed the sentiment. \u201cI love how PAA can make anyone feel welcome, regardless of major, post-grad plans, or ethnicity,\u201d Corrina said.\r\n\r\nInterested in being a part of PAA? From interning for PAA to participating in its programs, there are many ways students can be involved with the organization. PAA also hosts meetings and events throughout the year. On May 3rd, PAA will be having its 45th Anniversary &amp; End-of-The-Year Banquet and collaborating with SASC to host SASCerade\/PCN After-PAArty at night!\r\n\r\nLearn more about PAA by checking out their website at ucbpaa.wordpress.com or contacting them at ucb.paa@gmail.com!","image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 22:49:18 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 22:49:18 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 22:49:18 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":3759,"title":"hardboiled fall 2014 is recruiting!","slug":"hardboiled-fall-2014-is-recruiting","markdown":"\n<span style=\"color: #141823;\">Interested in publications?
