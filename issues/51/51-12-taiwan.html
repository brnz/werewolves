<p>On September 8, a group of Taiwanese Americans gathered for a rally in San 
  Francisco to commemorate an accord that was signed between the United States, 
  Japan, and 46 other nations half a century ago&#151;the San Francisco Peace 
  Treaty. In this treaty, Japan formally surrendered &#147;all right, title and 
  claims to Formosa and the Pescadores,&#148; but did not designate any beneficiary 
  state nor restore Taiwan to Chinese rule. The status of the former Japanese 
  colony was left unresolved long after the end of the Second World War. The Formosan 
  Association for Public Affairs, the premier Taiwanese American interest group, 
  states that the pact formed the &#147;basis for Taiwan&#146;s self-determination 
  [and] independence.&#148; </p>
<p>According to Taiwan&#146;s Central News Agency, more than 500 Taiwanese Americans 
  attended the rally at San Francisco&#146;s UN Plaza. U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi 
  (D-Calif.), a guest speaker at the plaza, said Taiwan is a &#147;flourishing 
  democratic country&#148; and urged the international community to allow the 
  nation to participate in international affairs. </p>
<p>Following Pelosi&#146;s speech, the demonstrators marched toward Union Square, 
  while displaying signs and shouting, &#147;Taiwan belongs to the Taiwanese,&#148; 
  to make the public aware that Taiwan&#146;s fate is to be decided by the island&#146;s 
  own residents; the marchers received warm support from passersby and car drivers 
  on Market Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>A symposium at the Grand Hyatt concluded the 50th anniversary celebrations 
  in San Francisco. Lung-chu Chen, a professor at New York Law School; Richard 
  Kagan, professor of history at Hamline University; and Tom Campbell, professor 
  of law at Stanford University and former U.S. Rep. (R-Calif.), engaged in discussions 
  on the treaty&#146;s significance to Taiwan&#146;s sovereignty. One of the topics 
  discussed at the symposium was America&#146;s stake in the Taiwan question&#151;Kagan 
  said the peace treaty with Japan &#147;did not establish the peace. And because 
  of this, the war in Asia is still simmering. But this time, the major antagonists 
  are not the U.S. and Japan, but Beijing and Taipei.&#148;</p>
<p>Since the San Francisco Peace Treaty is the only legal document that exists 
  pertaining to Taiwan&#146;s status, self-determination by Taiwanese citizens 
  is the solution that best reflects the principles of democracy and the Charter 
  of the United Nations. But such an option requires world support and, especially, 
  the commitment of Taiwan&#146;s strongest ally&#151;America&#151;in condemning 
  China&#146;s tactics of intimidation toward the Taiwanese. </p>
<p>At the closing ceremony of the symposium, Professor Campbell cited the Gulf 
  War as an example of the need for clarity in the American foreign policy. On 
  the eve of Iraq&#146;s invasion of Kuwait, the U.S. made it clear that it would 
  not engage in warfare, which probably gave Iraq felicitous signals to attack 
  Kuwait immediately afterward. &#147;The cause of world peace, as well as basic 
  political freedom, is best advanced by America stating clearly that it will 
  defend its ally, Taiwan, if it is attacked&#148; were Campbell&#146;s final 
  words in his speech, and words we should not forget. </p>
