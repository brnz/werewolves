<p>Miriam Ching Louie&#146;s new book, <i>Sweatshop Warriors: Immigrant Women Workers 
  Take On the Global Factory</i>, opens with the story of twelve Chinese seamstresses 
  waging a campaign against garment manufacturer Jessica McClintock in 1994. The 
  women are trying to recover unpaid wages from the corporate manufacturer; they 
  demand corporate responsibility. This battle has been ongoing for over two years. 
  60 Minutes approaches the seamstresses for interviews to be used on a segment 
  on the garment industry&#146;s labor practices. Although the women fear getting 
  fired and blacklisted for the interviews, they agree to do them, because they 
  want their story told. </p>
<p>The seamstresses gather at the Asian Immigrant Women Advocates center in Oakland 
  Chinatown to watch the segment, to see their story being broadcast to millions 
  of Americans on national television. As the women come on screen and speak in 
  their native tongues about the injustices of sweatshop labor, the women realize 
  that 60 Minutes does not translates what they&#146;re saying into English. The 
  women&#146;s hopes to broaden awareness for their campaign against Jessica McClintock, 
  and the unfair labor conditions of the garment industry, were undeniably crushed. 
  As Ching Louie puts it, &#147;60 Minutes has exposed their faces and silenced 
  them.&#148;</p>

<p>Sweatshop Warriors gives voice to women workers like these seamstresses. Miriam 
  Ching Louie tells it just like it is, exposing the brutal labor conditions, 
  long hours, and maltreatment faced by all kinds of immigrant women workers in 
  her book. Louie shows the importance of these women&#146;s movements; she stresses 
  the falsity of the mainstream media&#146;s (like 60 Minutes) portrayal of these 
  women as helpless victims. &#147;These women are trailblazers!&#148; Louie declares 
  at a reading of her book at Eastwind Books in Berkeley. A long-time activist, 
  Louie has been involved in several immigrant labor-oriented organizations, such 
  as the Women of Color Resource Center, Asian Immigrant Women Advocates, the 
  Garment Workers Justice Campaign, and Fuerza Unida. She has worked over three 
  decades empowering immigrant women to fight against today&#146;s growing global 
  economy. Her work has been widely published in several different anthologies 
  and she has led women&#146;s forums and talks all across the world. Who else 
  would be a more fitting author to write one of the definitive books on sweatshop 
  labor?</p>
<p>Most immigrants who come to this country are oftentimes forced into such low-level 
  jobs as sewing, cleaning, or food service, receiving nothing but underpayment, 
  disrespect, too many hours, and near sub-human conditions. They are wholly and 
  completely taken advantage of by corporate America, and oftentimes are stripped 
  of such basic rights as minimum wage. Sweatshop Warriors highlights the lives 
  and profiles of women labor movement leaders who organized against the injustices 
  and pains of the garment industry. Warriors is split up into different sections 
  based on three different ethnicities: Chinese immigrants, Mexican immigrants, 
  and Korean immigrants. In a very real and personal way, it details the thoughts 
  and events in these women&#146;s lives which led them to form strikes, revolts, 
  and protests, some of them successful, some of them not. Campaigns have been 
  waged (and won!)against such companies as Levi-Strauss, Donna Karan, Jessica 
  McClintock, and restaurants in Los Angeles&#146;s Koreatown, among others. Louie 
  says that her book &#147;is for the women who [she] interviewed, who&#146;ve 
  been making all these sacrifices, doing all this organizing work in the communities. 
  It&#146;s to record their voices and their struggle.&#148;</p>
<p>More importantly, Warriors is not just a 20th century history book on labor 
  movements and activism; it tells about the all-important and often-neglected 
  why behind these immigrant women&#146;s actions. The women reflect on their 
  past, their family struggles, their individual cultures, their ethnicity, and 
  even the factors that led them to take such poor-paying jobs in the first place. 
  &#147;The book is meant to be the property of the Asian and Latino communities, 
  which also includes the children of these workers, and their relatives.&#148; 
  says Louie. </p>
<p>The book not only documents super-women in the ever-constant fight against 
  corporate gigantism and patriarchic capitalism, but also digs deep into the 
  heart of what it means to be an immigrant, what it means to be a woman, and 
  what it means to be an American. &#147;In the anti-globalization movement,&#148; 
  says Louie, &#147;white anti-global, anti-corporatization people tend to jump 
  up define the message and issues. Though they&#146;re an important force, it 
  can a reproduction of the same kind of racial and class bias, with the white 
  people who have connections.&#148; The importance of the book is that it gives 
  voice where it matters most &#150; from the communities where the organizing 
  starts. &#147;A lot of times, if we don&#146;t do this, people will write our 
  history for us, not necessarily in the way that it happened,&#148; Louie says, 
  &#147;I&#146;m hoping that this book will say, hey, that isn&#146;t really who 
  started the movement, and that&#146;s not who&#146;s been in here for the long 
  haul. Let&#146;s get our priorities right, in terms of where this movement originates 
  from and who should have the larger voice.&#148;</p>
<p> Louie also states that these women cannot wage these wars alone-they are, 
  in fact, supported by various organizations such as those that Louie has been 
  involved in. As Glen Omatsu, editor of AmeriAsia Journal, says, &#147;Through 
  the organizing vehicles of community-based workers&#146; centers, these Chinese, 
  Korean and Latina immigrants are challenging not only the lynchpins of the corporate 
  economy but also the traditional model of union organizing.&#148; In light of 
  the 9/11 tragedy, these organizations are &#147;especially precious,&#148; says 
  Louie, &#147;people can fall back on those groups, their organizing networks.&#148; 
  In the war against globalization, this is a critical time. &#147;People who 
  say something against the way things are going are going to be dong so at a 
  greater risk; they&#146;re going to be called unpatriotic, unrealistic, jeopardizing 
  the national security. We need a longer term view of what it&#146;s going to 
  take to change the situation.&#148; Sweatshop Warriors, with its stories of 
  garment workers&#146; trials, pains, and triumphs offers a way to see that view.</p>
