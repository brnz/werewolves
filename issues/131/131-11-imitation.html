<h2>is imitation really the
sincerest form of flattery?</h2>
by kim filipinas

<p><b><i>Hollywood makeovers of Asian films hint at deeper problems of
cultural differences and the portrayal of Asians in the media</i></b></p>

<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. It’s an aphorism
tinged with sarcasm—no one likes a copycat after all. Yet
American remakes of Asian movies are simply accepted; many
Americans aren’t even aware that the movie they watched had
its origins in China or Japan. Am I elitist for cringing over the
latest Hollywood version of yet another Japanese horror or
South Korean romance? I’d like to pose the counter-question:
if the original was good, why is a remake even necessary?</p><p>
It’s been suggested that remakes merely reflect an
increasingly transnational world where goods and information
move through increasingly porous borders. This idea of
an “Asian presence” in American cinema is met with both
enthusiasm and dismay. Enthusiasts emphasize that remakes
bespeak the rising prestige of Asian cinema. The not-soenthused
worry of America’s undergoing “orientalization.”</p><p>
But why not simply export the Asian movies to America
in original form? After all, American films have a large presence
in Asia, and Asians watch subtitled or dubbed versions rather
than remakes.</p><p>
Is it that remakes are profitable? For instance Martin
Scorsese’s “The Departed” (2006) grossed $289,847,354
worldwide, an amount that completely eclipses the original
“Infernal Affairs” (Hong Kong, 2004) which garnered a
comparatively modest $8,708,932. Roy Lee, the Korean-
American producer who brought movies like “The Ring”
to America, has even made a business out of the process,
his brokering of Asian movies gaining him the title “king of
remakes.”</p><p>
Given the speculative nature of the film industry,
remakes have backfired. Take “My Sassy Girl,” a South
Korean romantic comedy that has gained popularity all over
Asia - but apparently failed to interest American audiences.
The remake, which did poorly in test screenings, was relegated
to the movie graveyard as a straight-to-DVD release. Roy Lee
stated in an interview with the Associated Press that American
men rejected the idea of a woman bossing around a man in
a romantic relationship. Truth of the matter is, “My Sassy Girl”
was extremely specific to South Korean culture (love motels
and mandatory military service are just a few of the things you
wouldn’t find in America today), and simply couldn’t mean the
same to Americans.</p><p>
Apparently simply remaking a movie doesn’t guarantee
the remaking of success—you have to take cultural
differences into account. Indeed there’s a translational quality
to these second-generation films despite the fact that they’ve
intentionally averted subtitling and dubbing (two things the
American public apparently hate). It simply makes sense to
replace the samurai of Akira Kurosawa’s “The Seven Samurai”
(1954) with the cowboy in “The Magnificent Seven” (1960), a
figure particularly entrenched in the American idiom.
Thus, remakes function as makeovers, giving a facelift to
the setting, storyline, and characters. In “The Ring,” America’s
2002 rendition of a 1998 Japanese horror film, the setting is
changed from Japan to Washington, ostensibly replacing the
ethnically-Japanese cast with white Americans. This route
seems to be the most typical of Hollywood remakes. A slightly
different approach is taken by “The Grudge” (a 2004 remake of
the 2003 Japanese film” Ju-on: The Grudge”). Like “The Ring,”
the core cast consists of white characters, with Sarah Michelle
Geller as the lead. However, the remake is set in Japan.</p><p>
Is “The Grudge” more authentic for locating itself in its
native Japan? I can’t say, although I do believe that’s what
the producers were aiming for. After all, “The Grudge” was
riding on the coattails of the very successful “The Ring,” widely
known to have been based on a Japanese film. Locating the
movie in Japan makes the ghosts of the movie particularly
Japanese—and this Japanese exoticism is set up to contrast
a white American point of view.</p><p>
In Laura Mulvey’s essay “Visual Pleasure and Narrative
Cinema” (1975), the author suggests that watching a movie
allows viewers to temporarily assume the point of view of the
main characters of the film. For “The Grudge,” the movie’s point
of view has become “Americanified” by the selection of white
actors for the leads. This identification is reinforced through the
contrast created by casting ethnically Japanese ghosts. I’d call
it pretty racist to locate horror in the “other.” This also happens
in the 2008 remake of “Shutter,” initially a 2004 Thai film. The
remake is set in Tokyo (the original was set in New York), with
two white leads, Joshua Jackson and Rachel Taylor. The part
of the vengeful ghost is played, unsurprisingly, by a Japanese
actress (Megumi Okina).</p><p>
Are Asian countries as different as Thailand and
Japan so easily conflated? It makes me think of the 2007
Academy Awards, during which “The Departed” won for best
adapted screenplay. The commentator incorrectly attributed
the provenance for the original as Japan rather than Hong
Kong. That’s 1,717 miles off the mark. Maybe this isn’t too
exceptional for Hollywood, the great homogenizer of movies,
but the American public—Asian Americans included—
deserves more.</p>
