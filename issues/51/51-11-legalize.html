<p>The recent hate incidents and crimes against many Arabs and Arab Americans 
  represent a larger problem that the needs and rights of immigrants are being 
  ignored and misunderstood by mainstream American society. </p>
<p>For over the past year and a half, community organizations and individual activists 
  in Los Angeles have taken a unique multi-ethnic organizing approach to address 
  immigrant rights. The Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Organizing Network (MIWON) 
  is a coalition group networking the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of 
  Los Angeles (CHIRLA), Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates (KIWA), Pilipino Worker 
  Center (PWC), and the Garment Workers Center (GWC). MIWON has been working on 
  a broad Legalization effort to ensure that unheard immigrants have a voice. 
  Immigrants make up a &#147;functional underclass&#148; in American society, 
  working in sub-standard conditions in low-wage, physically demanding industries. 
</p>
<p>Immigrants from many ethnicities and backgrounds work in jobs that many American 
  citizens would not want to work in, especially in California. And because many 
  of these workers are &#147;undocumented&#148;, they are blatantly exploited 
  by employers while lacking equal access to healthcare, education, housing and 
  other services that American citizens have. The basic fact is that immigrants 
  contribute enormously to our economic prosperity; however, they are not treated 
  with the fundamental dignity and respect that they deserve.</p>
<p>Recognizing that these issues must be addressed, MIWON was formed to help promote 
  a broad legalization program. On May 1st, International Workers Day, MIWON organized 
  a massive march and rally. Over 5,000 workers and supporters took to the streets 
  of Los Angeles to call for general amnesty for all immigrant workers. </p>
<p> To follow up with the May 1st rally, on August 18th, MIWON held a Community 
  Town Hall Meeting at the First Unitarian Church in Los Angeles. Workers from 
  a variety of low-wage industries, from restaurant, garment, health-care, day 
  laborers, and domestic workers all united to present an immigrant workers platform 
  to local, state, and federal government officials, as well as various community 
  and religious leaders.</p>
<p>MIWON&#146;s campaign seeks to:</p>
<ol>
  <li> implements a leadership development curriculum with immigrant workers from 
    different low-wage industries to help them build and advance a pro-immigrant, 
    pro-worker, civil rights agenda. </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li> strategize and develop advocacy and legislative campaigns to improve living 
    conditions for immigrant working families. </li>
</ol>
<p>As much as we think that the United States has made enormous strides to embraceing 
  the diversity of this nation, it has not. Instead, the reaction that many American 
  citizens have displayed because of recent terrorist events show a disturbing 
  and dangerous problem. Many have a raw misunderstanding and ignorance, as well 
  as a lack of tolerance for immigrants from all nationalities and ethnicities. 
  And as Asian Americans, it is important to recognize that the struggles that 
  many new immigrants go through are the same problems that our families endured 
  when first coming to this country. </p>
