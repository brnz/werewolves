<p>To mark the one week anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the 
  editorial board of the Daily Californian decided to publish the most incendiary 
  example of bigotry, slander, and racist scapegoating seen thus far on the Berkeley 
  campus, in relation to the WTC and Pentagon attacks. </p>
<p>It is said that a picture speaks a thousand words, but the &#145;words&#146; 
  represented by Darren Bell&#146;s cartoon were not merely a manifestation of 
  free speech. Rather, they were corrosive words that propagate the high level 
  of ignorance that has resulted in violence, vandalism, and murder across the 
  country &#150; even penetrating the Bay Area, the &#145;liberal capital&#146; 
  of the US. </p>
<p>This is not to say that the cartoon is directly responsible for people wanting 
  to go to war with Islam. However, the cartoon directly associates Islam and 
  Allah (the Arabic word for God) with the crimes in question. The ignorance and 
  blind rage of the general American public has manifested itself in alarming 
  ways these past weeks, such as the multiple cases of harassment and murder of 
  male members of the Sikh community, who wear turbans and beards. What is truly 
  frightening is that the bullets that killed our Sikh neighbors were meant for 
  Muslims and Arabs. </p>

  What started out as individually concerned students wanting to meet with some 
  representatives turned into a formal protest and sit-in, due to the refusal of 
  the editorial board to even come out and look them in the eye.

<p>The mainstream media, which is supposed to be a source of information, has 
  not helped to educate people as much as one would hope; I would even say that 
  they have fanned some of the flames. For example, broadcasting the portrait 
  of Osama bin Laden only a few hours after the initial attacks &#150; before 
  any substantial evidence surfaced &#150; achieved no other purpose than giving 
  America&#146;s panicked psyche an immediate enemy.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone by network news agencies in the game of unprofessionalism, 
  the Daily Cal editors have exhibited a cold callousness to the concerns of a 
  diverse coalition of student groups, representing ethnically, religiously, and 
  politically marginalized communities at UC Berkeley. The editorial staff at 
  the Daily Cal refuses to understand that printing Bell&#146;s cartoon is nothing 
  more than inflammatory propaganda.</p>
<p>The Daily Cal has refused to sit down for the discussion they promised the 
  130 individuals who stood in their office until 3am that night. As a side note, 
  the protestors who &#147;occupied&#148; the Daily Cal office on Tuesday did 
  not enter the office as protestors. What started out as individually concerned 
  students wanting to meet with some representatives turned into a formal protest 
  and sit-in, due to the refusal of the editorial board to even come out and look 
  them in the eye. As of yet, no one from the board at the Daily Cal has accepted 
  or returned calls from various Muslim students or representatives of the Council 
  on American Islamic Relations (CAIR).</p>
<p>To be fair, the Daily Cal was using it&#146;s right to free speech when it 
  printed the cartoon in question. However, with any freedom comes ethical and 
  moral responsibility. Furthermore, not only are freedom and responsibility coupled 
  together, but so are journalism and integrity. </p>
<p>What this cartoon represented was symptomatic of a larger flaw within the mainstream 
  media establishment. First, there is no respect paid towards cultures that are 
  deemed alien to America &#150; in this case, Islam. Personally, I would be very 
  wary of bringing the name of anyone&#146;s God or gods into a satirical cartoon, 
  but perhaps I don&#146;t have what it takes to be the editor of a respectable 
  newspaper. Second, the cartoon shows a complete oversimplification, homogenization, 
  and most importantly, ignorance concerning Islam. </p>
<p>While mainstream Muslim scholars have condemned such terrorist attacks, there 
  was no effort made by the Daily Cal to make the distinction between the average 
  Muslim and the &#145;Muslims&#146; who might be responsible for the attacks 
  on the 11th. </p>
<p>Here is a challenge for the Daily Cal: show the Berkeley community the quote&#146;s 
  origin, context, and relevance to the events of September 11. Keep in mind, 
  the CBS interview with the Palestinian member of Hamas, who said the words found 
  in Bell&#146;s cartoon, was blatantly misquoted. That point aside, even if he 
  did use those words, they would not represent the entirety of Islam. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it will be shown that the Daily Cal is unable to meet this challenge. 
  With some careful consideration, the Daily Cal can only find that they should 
  not have printed the cartoon in the first place and must apologize for doing 
  so. </p>
