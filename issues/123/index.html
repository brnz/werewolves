<h2>editors' note</h2>

<p>Dear <b>hardboiled</b> readers,</p><p>It's been a year of late nights organizing workshops, writing and editing articles, and designing memorable covers (i.e. girl with throat slightly cut open by scissors personifying the freeze of the EALC budget cuts). There were many joyful moments and some tense times, but things always.... just barely came through.</p><p><b>hardboiled</b> has always been about cracking open mainstream headlines by injecting our own slant on neglected Asian American issues. As the only Asian American newsmagazine in an overwhelming Asian American student majority, we serve a crucial role in standing up against prejudices and stereotypes including but not limited to Asian Americans. In a lot of cases, <b>hardboiled</b> is the lifeline to get to know what's going on for many students: we are the ten thousand kilowatt light bulb that brightens dimly lit issues.</p><p>What I will miss the most alongside those late nights chugging down some cheap green sludge "energy" drink that promises 10 hours of vitamin B12 induced hyper-activity, is working with the young and energetic <b>hardboiled</b> staff. It is to our newcomers that provide hardboiled that extra light to flash through superficial issues and get to the core.</p><p><b>hardboiled</b> will truly be missed.</p>
<p>P.S. I am not that old.</p><p>Naomi Oren<br>Art Director</p>

<p><b>a love letter</b></p><p>Dear Babycakes,</p><p>It's been a wild ride and unfortunately, it's time to move on. When I first met you, you took my breath away, literally. Your big and bold style stood out above the rest. No other newsmagazine could compare. First impressions are important and you did not let me down. After picking up a copy two years ago, I googled you and found the amazing <a href="hardboiled.berkeley.edu" target=_blank>hardboiled.berkeley.edu</a>. (Don't worry, I google all my lovers.) After that, I enjoyed our weekly dates on Wednesday nights. Thanks for the free sushi and cupcakes! As things got serious, our commitment grew and I could not keep my hands off of you. You taught me many things that I will never forget in the editing room, in the classroom and in love. Thank-you for showing me compassion, empathy and friendship. May you seduce many more lovers in the forms of writers, designers and activists for your never ending cause. Vive la différence!</p>

<p>Forever yours,<br>Kat Nguyen<br>Layout Editor</p><p>*note: The phrase is used to celebrate the difference between any two groups of people (or simply the general diversity of individuals).</p>
