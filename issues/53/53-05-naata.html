<p>NAATA has been funding, producing, distributing, exhibiting films, videos, 
  and media to support Asian Pacific American artists as well as promote and raise 
  awareness of the Asian Pacific American communities. Among the twenty world 
  premieres is Romeo Candido&#146;s director debut, Lolo&#146;s Child. Justin 
  Lin&#146;s Better Luck Tomorrow will premier in San Francisco on opening night 
  while Gail Dogin&#146;s award winning documentary Daughter from Danang and Timonthy 
  Bui&#146;s Green Dragon will be shown on the final night of the festival.</p>
<p><b>Better Luck Tomorrow</b></p>
<p>Ben Manibag (Parry Shen), a high school overachiever with a tunnel vision to 
  Stanford, slowly finds himself tumbling into a life of mischief and corruption. 
  Under the pressures of the competitive world of valedictorians, he innocently 
  begins with cheat sheets and shoplifting and later finds himself leading a double 
  life with guns, drugs, and Las Vegas escapades. This film is both a dark parody 
  of the cutthroat college application process and an exploration of suburban 
  teen restlessness in Asian America.</p>
<p>This long anticipated follow-up to Shopping For Fangs (1997) by Justin Lin 
  (writer, editor, director, producer), Better Luck Tomorrow premiered at the 
  Sundance Film Festival and was well received. Lin wanted to explore his own 
  life growing up as an Asian American in SoCal suburbs during the 80s and today&#146;s 
  upper middle class youth&#146;s urban gangsta mentality. Lin has directed numerous 
  award-winning shorts, winning the UCLA&#146;s Spotlight award and Honorable 
  Mention at the Chicago Asian-American Film Festival for his Soybean Milk along 
  the way. </p>
<p>Better Luck Tomorrow will be screened on opening night at 7PM , March 7, at 
  AMC Kabuki Theaters, followed by an opening night gala reception with Director 
  Lin at Fort Mason Center Landmark Building A, San Francisco. </p>
<p><b>Green Dragon</b></p>
<p>The festival will close with a film that visits the Vietnamese refugee processing 
  camp, San Diego&#146;s Camp Pendleton, near the end of the Vietnam War. From 
  director and writer Timothy Linh Bui, the story focuses on a few refugees as 
  they befriend each other and learn to depend on one another. The film follows 
  the journey of a young Vietnamese boy, Pham (Trung Hieu Nguyen), and his uncle 
  turned camp manager Tai Tran (Don Duong), and a volunteer cook, Addie (Forest 
  Whitaker). More than a poignant look into the lives of Vietnamese refugees as 
  they flee the fall of Saigon, the film unravels their paths to recovery from 
  the horrors of war and the discovery of new meaning in life. </p>
<p>Green Dragon will be screened 7PM, March 14, at the AMC Kabuki Theaters followed 
  by a closing night gala reception with Director Bui at the Diego Rivera Gallery, 
  San Francisco Art Institution, 800 Chestnut Street, San Francisco. </p>
<p><b>Daughter from Danang</b></p>
<p>Separated from her mother at the end of Vietnam war, this documentary follows 
  the life of a woman as she reunites with her mother after twenty-two years. 
  Mai Thi Hiep was among thousands of orphans and Amerasian children, whose parents 
  feared for their safeties, brought to the United States to be adopted through 
  &#147;Operation Babylift.&#148; Renamed Heidi Neville and raised in Tennessee, 
  she goes on a search to find her biological mother, Mai Thi Kim, in Vietnam. 
  Culture clash and conflicting expectations soon follow a happy reunion as Heidi 
  feels alienated from her lost family yet pressured to help them financially. 
  Directors Gail Dolgin and Vicente Franco follow the two women through the emotional 
  search, poignant reunion, and heartbreaking departure. This film is the winner 
  of the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. 
</p>
<p>Daughter From Danang will be screened 2:45PM, March 16, at the Camera 3 Cinemas, 
  Second and San Carlos Streets, San Jose; and 7:30PM, March 13 at the Pacific 
  Film Archive with an appearance of filmmakers Dolgin and Franco. </p>
<p><b>Lolo's Child</b></p>
<p>Making its world premiere at the film festival, director/writer/editor/actor 
  Romeo Candido brings a story of a songwriter who learns the history of his family, 
  friends, and roots as he comes to terms with his father&#146;s death. Candido&#146;s 
  debut feature, described as &#147;the first Pilipino Canadian musical dramedy&#148;, 
  is an Asian family melodrama, comedy with a serious undertone, and a lyrical 
  story incorporating Candido&#146;s songs. </p>
<p>Lolo&#146;s Child will premiere 9:30PM, March 8, and 9:15, March 11, AMC Kabuki 
  Theaters.</p>
