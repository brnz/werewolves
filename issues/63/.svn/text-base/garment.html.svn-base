        In a hardboiled 5.2 article entitled &#8220;Anna Wong Owes Me Blood Money,&#8221; 
        readers were informed about an upcoming case where over 200 workers who 
        sewed garments for Toha &#8220;Jimmy&#8221; Quan and Anna Wong were owed 
        over $850,000 in unpaid wages that date back to the spring of 2001. These 
        workers had worked in three factories: Wins Fashions, Inc., Wins of California, 
        Inc., and Wins Industries of America, Inc. One factory declared bankruptcy 
        in the summer of 2001, the other two were unregistered factories that 
        were shut down in August 2001 by the US Department of Labor. Many of these 
        workers are monolingual Chinese immigrant women who sewed for popular 
        labels like: J.C. Penny, Kmart, Sears, Wal-Mart, Tommy Hilfiger, Bebe, 
        the Gap, Sam&#8217;s Club, and the U.S. Army and Airforce.<br>
        <br>
        Workers had filed for wage claims with the California Labor Commissioner 
        early last year but were faced with legal stalls both with the state government 
        and with the former employers. Despite many threats of intimidation, workers 
        had begun to actively organize over the past year through a variety of 
        demonstrations and legal actions.<br>
        The workers have recently had a legal victory in early October. The State 
        of California tapped into a special &#8220;lock-box&#8221; fund to pay 
        240 Wins garment workers their much-deserved wages. Over $800,000 was 
        distributed to workers with checks ranging from a few hundred dollars 
        to over $10,000. It is reported that the average check was around $3,000.<br>
        <br>
        According to local news sources, alongside from the recent wage victory, 
        local California State Labor officials will be pursuing the contractors 
        of the Wins Garment establishments in hopes to hold them accountable for 
        their actions.</p>
