<blockquote>
  <i>&#151;hardboiled...Isn&#146;t that the Asian American paper?<br>
  &#151;Yeah...<br>
  &#151;(puzzled look) Oh...Then why are you handing it out?<br>
  &#151;Umm...what continent is India on, again?</i>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#146;s a conversation I recently had with an acquaintance while handing 
  out copies of this esteemed publication on campus, and after hours of soul-searching 
  and reflecting, I was led to the question: so, are more Asians &#145;yellow&#146; 
  or &#145;brown&#146;? This seemingly silly question actually has important implications 
  for how we understand the Asian American community and how others view us, as 
  well. It seems that throughout college courses, singles ads, and everyday conversations, 
  whenever someone drops the term &#145;Asian&#146;, what they really mean is 
  East Asian.</p>
<p>My brown brethren understand that when folks say &#145;Asian&#146;, they&#146;re 
  really only talking about descendants from China, Japan, the Koreas, Hong Kong, 
  and maybe Taiwan. As a South Asian, I find it a bit curious, at best, that a 
  term &#151; &#145;Asian American&#146; &#151; which is intended to bring together 
  disempowered communities actually further marginalizes many of the very groups 
  that the term purports to include, such as Pilipinos, Southeast Asians, as well 
  as my people from the subcontinent. The ways we use &#145;Asian&#146; actually 
  reproduces the core-periphery set-up of race relations within Asian America 
  &#151; the very mainstream/margins arrangement we seek to dismantle in the larger 
  society. And the brown ones among us are left to push and shove our way into 
  a label that represents a paltry 4% of the total population anyway.</p>
<p>How is it that &#145;Asian American&#146; has become so easily translatable 
  to &#145;yellow&#146;, in the first place? Here&#146;s my theory. While I understand 
  that the term emerged as a challenge to white supremacy in a movement towards 
  multiculturalism, it seems to have degenerated into a politically correct euphemism 
  for &#145;Oriental.&#146; When many (white) folks say &#145;Asian American&#146;, 
  what they&#146;re really thinking is &#145;Oriental&#146;, but most know they 
  shouldn&#146;t say that one out loud. In America, unlike many parts of Europe, 
  &#145;Oriental&#146; was historically (and is too often currently) used to refer 
  mainly to people of East Asian descent. So, since they didn&#146;t mean &#145;brown&#146; 
  when they said &#145;Oriental&#146;, they don&#146;t mean it now when they say 
  &#145;Asian American.&#146; And that probably gets reinforced in our own commuities, 
  as well.</p>
<p>In reality, though, how useful is the concept of &#145;Asia&#146;, anyway? 
  Somehow, a businessman trading stocks on the Nikkei exchange in Japan is supposed 
  to be connected to a housewife half a world away in Pakistan, and Jackie Chan 
  is linked to the Bollywood film industry. In many ways, the concept of &#145;Asia&#146; 
  comes across as a colonial/Eurocentric geographical construct with little or 
  no currency in how we view our lives and the world around us.</p>
<p>Here at home, America&#146;s conventional notions of &#145;Asians&#146; are 
  of chopstick-toting foreigners with slanted, almond-shaped eyes. Damn, even 
  the racist stereotypes marginalize us! I&#146;ve got folds in my eyelids, and 
  my mom is just as confused as the white customers when the chopsticks come out.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, being marginalized from an already-marginalized 
  group has created difficult situations for all of us. At Berkeley, how many 
  &#145;Asian&#146; student groups even pretend to include Filipinos, South Asians, 
  or Southeast Asians? It&#146;s not that their efforts at outreach have failed, 
  but that there isn&#146;t even the pretense of inclusion. This problem extends 
  well beyond this campus, too. Last month, I had the opportunity to attend the 
  East Coast Asian Student Union (ECASU) conference where, of nearly 1,000 participants, 
  there were maybe ten other South Asians. This experience led an enlightened 
  South Asian student to comment, in a workshop, that the conference should have 
  been more appropriately named the East Coast East Asian Student Union conference.</p>
<p>Then again, if the people themselves just aren&#146;t feelin&#146; the term, 
  maybe it&#146;s not very accurate. I know my mom, as a South Asian immigrant, 
  wouldn&#146;t feel any connection to a Chinese American teenager, even though 
  we say they are both Asian Americans. So, are we supposed to force the connection 
  by continually pushing people under the &#145;Asian American&#146; banner? And 
  if the term doesn&#146;t carry much weight in our communities, is it just an 
  artificial, academic label?</p>
<p>However, it seems that we can actually use the term &#145;Asian American&#146; 
  to challenge conventional notions of race and ethnicity in America &#150; to 
  show that even though we don&#146;t look or dress alike, and we could never 
  understand each other when speaking in our native tongues, we can still form 
  a community based on shared experiences of immigration, discrimination, and 
  marginalization.</p>
<p>I feel that hardboiled is one of the few groups that puts forth an honest effort 
  to impart a true pan-Asian American focus. Beyond that, we&#146;ve taken steps 
  to make links outside of our communities by putting together a collaborative 
  issue with the Black, Latino, and Muslim student papers &#150; X, which was 
  released in February.</p>
<p>By the way, based on my scientific formulas and calculations, &#145;yellow&#146; 
  Asians make up only about 40% of the Continent.</p>
