        Indie rock Asian American band Ee, led by former Korea Girl guitarist/vocalist 
        Tobin Mori has undergone some member changes following the release of 
        their first album Ramadan. The band now consists of four incredibly talented 
        members (Che Chou, Peter Nguyen, Sooyoung Park, and Tobin Mori) who came 
        together to create a sound that is uniquely Ee. After wrapping up their 
        first national tour last summer, they released their much anticipated 
        second LP, For 100 We Try Harder in September. hardboiled caught up with 
        Mori and got a chance to ask the lead singer a few questions.</p>
      <p>How'd you guys come up with the new album title, For 100 We Try Harder?<br>
        For 100 We Try Harder is the motto of 99 Ranch Supermarket. We think it 
        says everything- we want to do better, we want to improve. We're striving.</p>
      <p>For Ramadan and For 100 We Try Harder, you parodied the Ranch 99 symbol 
        for your CD design. How'd you come up with that idea?<br>
        Sooyoung and I were shopping at 99 Ranch one day, and I was standing in 
        line, staring at the logo, and it popped in my head- 'hey! 99 backwards 
        is ee...that's our logo!' I occasionally have flashes of genius-idiocy.<br>
        <br>
        The second track on your new album is really beautiful. Can you tell us 
        the meaning behind &quot;Beijing&quot;?<br>
        It's just me fantasizing about being in a famous Chinese punk-rock band.<br>
        Track 99 was hilarious. Was that a comment on rice rockets and the current 
        youth API culture?<br>
        Yes, I have a fascination with AZN car culture. Actually, it's more like 
        jealousy. I wish I had a cool lowered CRX with a gold kit. Ahhh. One day. 
        I have gold kit envy. </p>
      <p>What's the creative process for coming up with new tracks?<br>
        Usually, we just go to practice, and someone will come up with a lick 
        or riff. And, we'll jam on it until it becomes something, or dies a quiet 
        death. </p>
      <p>During your first national tour (especially in the Midwest) what type 
        of audiences did you attract?<br>
        I don't think I can categorize the Midwest audience as a type. They seem 
        like any other crowd; they are a little less Asian than out here in the 
        left coast, but that's just a reflection of the general population.</p>
      <p>I'm sure you get asked this all the time, but I'm really curious. Who's 
        currently in your cd player?<br>
        East River Pipe: Shining Hours In A Can, Carol King: Greatest Hits, Radiohead: 
        The Bends, Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions.</p>
      <p>Who would you love to collaborate with in your next album?<br>
        Darryl Hall and John Oates or Neil Halstead.<br>
        <br>
        Which bands have influenced your music?<br>
        Velvet Underground.</p>
      <p>Since you and your bandmates have day jobs in addition to the band, what 
        direction do you see Ee headed in the future?<br>
        Right now we're just playing and writing music that we like. That's the 
        end in and of itself. I'm not sure what the future will hold.</p>
      <p>With the emergence of Asian American members in mainstream bands, do 
        you think the doors will open for bands like yourself that' are made up 
        entirely of Asian American members?<br>
        I'm not sure. I think seeing four Asian guys onstage freaks some people 
        out; it certainly becomes an issue for many people. Asians have been trickling 
        in to the music scene slowly for years now, but an all Asian band might 
        be a bit much for the mainstream. It might scare them.</p>
      <p> Do you have any bizarre run-ins with crazed fans?<br>
        Unfortunately, no. I've never had a groupie.</p>
