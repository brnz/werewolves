<h2>enter, the president of the world</h2></a>
by melani sutedja</p>

<p><i>We know, we know.</i> It's been how many weeks since the streets of Berkeley erupted in impromptu parades, people atop stoplights, and Daily Cal photo-ops on the night of November 4? Whether they are still in awe of our future cabinet or already critical of his foreign policy, students on the home front made it clear that Obama's platform on 'Change' will be <i>the</i> shiz starting 2009.</p><p>Yet the 2008 elections have not just been an American election, but a world election as well. What else do you expect when an U.S candidate touches upon multiple intersectionalities? With a Kenyan father, an upbringing in Indonesia, and a Middle Eastern middle name of "Hussein," Obama breaks the royal lineage of last names sounding like "Roosevelt" and "Truman." True, the emergence of organizations called such as "Republicans for Obama" was already foretelling of his diverse support. Yet, by judging on how November 4 is already a national holiday in other parts of the world, it is safe to say that Americans are not the only ones stoked by the results.</p><p>In Indonesia, where Obama lived from 1967 to 1971, fans have created the "Good Luck Barry" group, titled after the name he went by in his schoolyard days- Barry Sotero. According to an MSNBC report, children at Obama's former school in celebrated his victory as they gathered to watch his acceptance speech, which many didn't understand, but elatedly absorbed. Regarded as a "native son" in Indonesia whose "modest beginnings, captured this country's imagination," according to the report, Obama represents hope that those in their situation can someday step foot in places like the White House. While the children back in Indonesia's Menteng Elementary most likely don't know his policies, Obama nevertheless stands for more than improving race relations. He insinuates a better political climate between the two countries, and an especially better rep for America, whose hostile track record with the ?War on Terror' has not made it a favorite with Muslim-populated countries like Indonesia.</p><p>Many also see his victory as a potential source of help to the global economic crisis, which many argue was exacerbated in part by the United States' mortgage dilemma.</p><p>While Indonesian President Susilo Yudhoyono has been public about his support for Obama, he also has expectations that the new President can now possibly lead the world out of its financial quagmire. At a press conference, he stated that the United States can now "take concrete steps to deal with the global financial crisis... triggered by the credit crunch in the United States." According to a Bloomberg wire, Yudhoyno also hopes "America can take part in the effort to cope with climate change and global warming."</p><p>Yet, the gathering sense of simultaneous pressure and support are not only within Indonesia, but other continents as well. Near his family's homestead in Kenya, crowds not only rejoiced until dawn at news of the United States' first black president, but declared a national holiday in Obama's honor.</p><p>Obama clearly has support from the place of his roots. In one picture, elated crowds in the Kenyan village of Kogelo lift Obama's half-brother Malik in the air?the caption reads: "We are going to the White House."  As Reuters found in their series of "Postcard to U.S President," which chronicles messages to the new US president from citizens worldwide, many are aware of the victory's revolutionary implications. Bob Wekesa of Nairobi, for example, beams that Obama should be "president of the world rather than the president of the US" since "people have actually voted for you even if they are not US citizens."</p><p>Others, however, express simultaneous feelings of concern. In the Reuters' findings, Nairobi residents ask that Obama "improve the trade relations between Africa and the western countries," or "help our African countries where our people are dying of hunger, please come in and assist this countries." As with similar sentiments from those in India asking him to help fight the dispute in the Himalayas or those in Cuba wanting to end the U.S blockade, Obama's image has shifted from that of a politician, to that of an international humanitarian.</p><p>An international bevy of high expectations obviously awaits the incoming President, especially at a time when a global financial crisis is worsening the global famine, military deployment in the Middle East is up in the air, and all eyes look towards this new cabinet for answers. Yet how reasonable is it for us to put the weight of the world on one man? Realistically speaking, the incoming President may have time to only tackle two big issues during his first two years in office--alleviating the economy and maneuvering out of the war in Iraq-- and some constituents may become aggravated. The tendency to idolize Obama further morphs him into a symbol, overlooking the politician, which will likely disillusion the world if any small function goes wrong.</p><p>For an election on the home-front, where he himself often downplayed race and glossed over issues of immigration and affirmative action, it is ironic that his skin color is what the rest of the world focuses on. While this election does command historical recognition for changing the visage of Americana, it is also important to recognize that it will mask institutionalized inequities that still persist by using the "if he can do it, there is no excuse" rhetoric. Nevertheless, we are slowly creating the stepping stones for more "Barrys" to rise above the glass ceiling. Hey, maybe there will be a couple of female ones too.</p>
