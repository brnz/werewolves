Tension in the Woods:<br>
Hmong Hunters Fall Victim to Hate Crimes<br><br>

by susan moua <br><br>

In November 2004, a Hmong man named Chai Soua Vang was convicted of killing six and wounding two hunters in Wisconsin. The case brought negative media attention to Asian Americans in the midnorthern states, Hmong in particular, and escalated racial tensions between Asian Americans and Caucasian hunters in the region. In 2005, Chai Soua Vang was found guilty and sentenced to six life sentences in jail; yet his imprisonment has done little to alleviate the ethnic conflict. Just a few months after the shooting incident took place, white hunters began to display bumper stickers that read “Save a Deer, Kill a Hmong” on the backs of their pick-up trucks.  <br><br>

Fast forward to this year, when another hunter is found dead in the forests, this time a Hmong American. Which begs the question: how did Cha Vang die? <br><br>

Cha Vang was found dead on January 7th, 2007 while on a hunting trip in northern Peshtigo, Wisconsin. When his body was discovered, authorities and investigators concluded that this case was in fact a homicide. Cha Vang, like Chai Soua Vang, immigrated from Laos as a refugee. Like many Hmong American men, Chai Soua and Cha Vang both enjoyed hunting because it was a homeland hobby. But unlike Chai Soua, who arrived in the eighties, Cha Vang had just arrived in 2004. In a CBS article written on January 8th, 2007, Vang’s wife of 13 years, Pang Vue, explains how she and Cha had grown up in the
refugee camps and had looked forward to coming to America. ““Our dream was just starting, just now beginning, and now it falls apart again,” she says. <br><br>

During the buildup to the Vietnam War, Hmongs participated in the secret war as United States allies, fighting the communists. However, after the communist Pathet Lao seized power in Vietnam, US soldiers  fled, leaving the Hmongs to fend for themselves. After escaping for their lives through jungles and rivers, the Hmongs finally found sanctuary in refugee camps on the coasts of Thailand. It was not until the early 1980’s that the United States finally recognized the Hmongs as a group of Southeast Asian minorities who aided them during the secret war, and allowed them to immigrate to America.  <br><br>

While Hmongs today are dispersed around the country, the largest Hmong community can be found in Minnesota, right next to Wisconsin. The man convicted of Vang’s murder is 28-year-old James Nichols, who is currently awaiting arraignment. On the first night of Vang’s disappearance, Nichols stumbled into a local
hospital with a gunshot wound in his hand. Although he admits responsibility for Vang’s death, he is claiming he acted out of self-defense. According to his testimonies, Nichols said that he and Vang had a dispute after he had told Vang to leave the hunting area. He said that Vang then tried to shoot and choke him and also claims that Vang had threatened to kill him if he did not leave the area. Investigators, however, found no bruises or injuries on Nichols’ neck or eyes when he had checked himself into the hospital. Pang Vue also pointed out that Vang did not speak English. <br><br>

The charges against Nichols are first-degree intentional homicide, concealing a corpse, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Authorities found Vang’s corpse covered and hidden with leaves and debris. Vang’s body was found to have been shot with a shotgun and stabbed six times, five times in the throat. Inside Vang’s mouth was a stick, shaped like a stake. The autopsy shows that Vang was shot at a closer distance than Nichols had claimed. The official criminal complaint, as reported by the Marinette County n ewspaper, stated “It appears that at the time he was shot, Mr. Vang was turning away and had his right arm across his chest.”<br><br>

In the beginning, this case was considered a hate crime due to current events like the Chai Soua Vang case. Just recently, however, the hate crime charges have been dropped. Many people, including Asian American activists, are angry and upset, since the dismissal of hate crime charges seems to ignore the current racial tension as well as the gratuitous stab wounds on the victim’s body. Upon being brought in an  interrogated at police headquarters, Nichols made disparaging remarks about the Hmongs; when asked about hunting, Nichols stated, “The Hmong are mean and kill everything that moves.” The criminal complaint classifies these as racist remarks, but friends of Nichols have told the press, “He isn’t a racist.” <br><br>

Sher Moua, a fourth year Hmong American student at Cal, disagrees. “It’s just one of those things that is obvious - the stage for a hate crime is there,” Moua said. “You have the event that sparked this event (the Chai Soua Vang case), you have the racist remarks that Nichols made, then you have an event that is similar to the Chai Soua Vang case, where again Hmong and Caucasian hunters are involved, and someone ends up dying. I think Nichols had racial motive. I don’t know the facts entirely but I feel like this is a hate crime and that Nichols should be charged for that as well. Although he isn’t, I hope that he does get the highest cost for murder.”<br><br>

Cher Chang, another Hmong American student from Cal, agrees. “This case should be recognized as a hate crime,” she said. “It might be hard to prove because it may just be one of those things we’ll never know, but there are just some things that stand out, like the way Vang was murdered.” Both Cal students agree that when they first heard the news about Cha Vang, they immediately thought it was a hate crime based on what happened with Chai Soua Vang. “It could just be a Caucasian man retaliating, angry because of what happened,” Chang said.<br><br>

After this series of events, will our hunters, especially visibly Asian American hunters, be safe? These events have caused intense racial tensions both within and outside of the communities in which they occurred. In Fresno, California, there are also a substantial number of Hmong male hunters who feel like they face racial tensions when they come in contact with Caucasian hunters.

Chang Yang, a 30-year old Hmong hunter from Fresno, notes his own apprehension. “I have Caucasian friends who joke about it but I don’t think it’s funny,” he said. “It is a little scary to go hunting in the forests because sometimes I can’t help but think what has happened in Wisconsin. I don’t feel safe because I think a lot of people who hunt in areas close to Fresno know that a lot of male Hmongs hunt. I think it has gotten different for me. My hunting experiences have changed since these two events have occurred. I’m much more aware when I’m hunting and I try not to cause trouble.” Yang says that he loves to hunt and is glad that he does not live in Wisconsin or Minnesota, where Hmongs deal more directly with the racial tensions. “I talk to my cousins who go through the same, racial jokes and actual racism. But they really live in it. I’m just affected by it. <br><br>

It is important to remember victims like Cha Vang and cases like Chai Soua Vang. In a way it is true that we will never completely know what happened between Chai Soua Vang and the six hunters in the woods, nor will we ever truly occurred between Cha Vang and James Nichols. But we do know for sure that Cha Vang was murdered, and that Nichols hid Vang’s mutilated body under leaves and branches. We need to seriously consider whether this crime  \was racially motivated or simply self-defense. Nichols is getting away with a hate crime; hopefully, he will not get away with murder. <br><br>
