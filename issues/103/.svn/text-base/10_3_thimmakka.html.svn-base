      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is no secret that the  Bay Area is home to an extremely assorted collection of fine dining. A casual,  ten minute stroll here in Berkeley can lead  you to the pungent scents of faraway Ethiopian or Indian cuisine. Ethnic  restaurants give patrons a taste of different cultures and lend depth to the  uniquely diverse Bay Area landscape.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, behind  the comfortable environment and delicious cuisine provided, restaurants must  deal with energy inefficiency and solid wastes, most definitely a lesser-known  and not-so-fine side of the restaurant business. For every scrumptious meal  produced, restaurants consume great amounts of energy for refrigerating and  heating food, while inefficiently disposing of environmentally-harmful  substances such as excess cooking oils, greases, and other solid wastes  leftover from the cooking and eating processes. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And the problem is not a  small one. A 2003 study by the California Integrated Waste Management Board  (CIWMB) concluded that among all commercial industries in the state, food is  the most prevalent waste material. Food makes up nearly a fifth of all  commercial waste, or over 3.5 millions tons a year. Earlier this year, the  CIWMB analyzed the quantity and categories of waste production from a number of  industries, including 27 full-service restaurants. The CIWMB concluded that  every year, full-service restaurants produce 4,403 pounds of waste for every  employee, among the highest industry rates of waste-production. Nearly  two-thirds of the waste produced was some manner of food, or about 2,900 pounds  per employee. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1998, activist and  entrepreneur Ritu Primlani set out to change how society views  environmentalism. Working with local governments, businesses, and restaurants,  Primlani founded Thimmakka, a non-profit group devoted to combating the  excessive, environmental inefficiencies of fine dining establishments  throughout the Bay Area. &ldquo;We wanted to outreach to ethnic communities,&rdquo;  Primlani stated. &ldquo;Where do people meet? Besides churches and temples, people  meet at restaurants for food. It only made sense to go there.&rdquo; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thimmakka is a non-profit  organization dedicated to &ldquo;greening&rdquo; ethnic restaurants. &ldquo;Greening&rdquo; consists of  applying environmental measures, implementing new equipment, and raising  awareness for restaurant owners and patrons alike. Through greening, Thimmakka  hopes to cut down on solid waste and air pollution while increasing energy  conservation and recycling usage. While Thimmakka helps all types of businesses  out, ethnic restaurants remain as primary environmental targets. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Primlani actually derived  the name Thimmakka from a tireless south Indian activist of the same name.  Nearly 50 years ago, Thimmakka, along with late husband Chikkanna, began  planting banyan trees along a four kilometer stretch. Today, Thimmakka has  &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; 400 banyan trees, planting, tending, and nurturing each one, treating  them as if they were her own children. The activist Thimmakka embodies the core  value that Primlani&rsquo;s non-profit promotes: environmentalism should be  accessible to everyone, regardless of class, race, or language barriers. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thimmakka allows Primlani  to combine her twin passions of environmental and social change, and the local  community felt her impact immediately. Before Thimmakka, there was a total of  one green ethnic restaurant in the Bay Area; after Thimmakka&rsquo;s first year,  there were ten. For Primlani, however, statistics are not wholly important; she  wants to ensure that society as a whole is gaining environmental awareness, and  the positives of greening. &ldquo;Businesses that are not green are inconvenient to  everyone,&rdquo; emphasized Primlani. &ldquo;They waste energy. They waste water. They  pollute the air. They dump pollutants into landfills. We are trying to create  an infrastructure that makes sense.&rdquo; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unsatisfied with Thimmakka&rsquo;s  growing influence in the Bay Area, Primlani is determined to spread its message  of environmental awareness to restaurants nationwide. Today, Thimmakka  continues to expand into other restaurant markets, and people are now coming to  Primlani to help green their businesses. Through word-of-mouth, Primlani has  been able to establish Thimmakka in both Miami, Florida, and Vancouver, British    Columbia in Canada.  Establishing guidelines for restaurant environmentalism is difficult because of  how every locale approaches environmentalism as a whole. &ldquo;Each county is  unique,&rdquo; observes Primlani, which makes it all the more impressive that  Thimmakka has been able to coordinate activities from its Berkeley hub. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With over 100 restaurants  in the Bay Area officially green, 15 each in both Miami and  Vancouver, and more restaurants applying to become green, Thimmakka continues  the struggle for overhauling and revising societal environmentalism. For  Primlani, the struggle will not end until people recognize the practicality and  benefit of green businesses. &ldquo;We want to make systemic changes,&rdquo; Primlani said.  &ldquo;Today, it is unconscionable to walk around with an African slave. That is our  goal, to expand environmentalism, to make it part of civic sense.&rdquo; </font></p>
