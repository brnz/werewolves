    <td colspan="5" valign="top" class="articletext"> <p> People whine, gag, and 
        vomit &#8211; and millions of viewers faithfully tune in. You know what 
        I&#8217;m talking about. Admit it &#8211; you are no better than the rest 
        of the obsessed-with-reality-television viewing public . . . you have 
        seen an episode of Fear Factor. I&#8217;ve seen it myself &#8211; I&#8217;m 
        fascinated by what people will do for $50,000. The show is a ton of fun 
        &#8211; watching people endure anything for money! But what interests 
        me the most is what Fear Factor forces the contestants to eat. Yes, it 
        is entertaining to watch people stuff pig rectum, caterpillars, and worms 
        down their mouths, but did you ever consider the fact that Fear Factor 
        evokes more serious implications than just making people throw up? At 
        a family gathering, my aunt described how she saw contestants on Fear 
        Factor eating fertilized duck eggs! Now, if you missed the episode, just 
        imagine people eating partially formed baby ducks, complete with beaks, 
        feathers, and claws. My aunt was not telling me so that I could share 
        in her disgust of the thought of eating baby ducks; rather, she was wondering 
        why the food was considered so disgusting. Let me explain: in the Philippines, 
        where my aunt was born and raised, there is a delicacy called balut, or, 
        as the American viewing public now knows it &#8211; fertilized duck eggs.<br>
        <br>
        The conversation with my aunt raised some questions &#8211; does Fear 
        Factor always exploit a food that is considered a delicacy in other countries? 
        Do shows like Fear Factor shape the way Americans view other cultures? 
        How do people like my aunt feel about their culture after their ethnic 
        food was thrown up on national television? What kind of consequences does 
        Fear Factor present to people like my aunt?<br>
        <br>
        With the help of my mother, who was born and raised in the Philippines 
        until the age of twenty, I ventured into the Fear Factor website and discovered 
        that four out of the seven eating stunts during the first two seasons 
        included ingredients that are commonly found in Pilipino dishes! And, 
        of course, balut is a Pilipino dish, one that is considered a nutritious 
        food prescribed by doctors, a delicacy for the elite, and an aphrodisiac. 
        However, Fear Factor&#8217;s website simply states, &#8220;In the Philippines, 
        it is called balut. In America, we just call it gross.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Fear Factor spaghetti, cow brains, and buffalo testicles were the three 
        other eating stunts for contestants that may not have been a problem if 
        they had been Pilipinos. First, Fear Factor spaghetti is made with animal 
        blood encased in pig intestines and lots of live, squiggly worms. Excluding 
        the worms, the rest of the ingredients are familiar to Pilipino cooks. 
        Dinuguan is any Pilipino dish made with animal blood and the animal&#8217;s 
        insides. However, dinuguan is almost always made with pig blood and pig 
        intestines, definitely not a far cry from Fear Factor spaghetti. Believe 
        it or not, cow brains are also conconsumed throughout the Philippines. 
        Depending on where you live in the country, you either eat them fried 
        or with coconut milk. Eating buffalo testicles seems quite similar to 
        eating &#8220;soup number five,&#8221; a soup in the Philippines made 
        with bull testicles.<br>
        <br>
        Bell and Valentine, authors of Consuming Geographies, believe that food 
        and culture are very closely linked to one another. They argue that &#8220;consumption 
        is seen as the dominant contemporary cultural force,&#8221; meaning that 
        people mainly experience other cultures through food. <br>
        <br>
        Experience proves the veracity of this statement. Is there really any 
        other way that you immerse yourself in a culture, other than actually 
        being in the country, than through food? Do you immerse in the history, 
        arts, politics, and morals of Italy more than you consume pasta? Thus, 
        the foods of a country essentially come to represent the culture as a 
        whole. If this statement is true, what does it mean when Fear Factor portrays 
        Pilipino food as disgusting? Just the fact that the food is on Fear Factor, 
        added to the contestants&#8217; reactions &#8211; before and after &#8211; 
        to it, make for negative messages about the food to the American public. 
        If food captures the essence of a culture, but that food is nationally 
        televised as revolting and despicable, what does that convey about the 
        culture? More importantly, what effects can these unnerving portrayals 
        of Pilipino food have on the American public? Unfortunately, Fear Factor 
        may reinforce ideas of American superiority and may establish unfair prejudices 
        against Pilipino culture.<br>
        <br>
        Seeing one&#8217;s ethnic food on television as a difficult stunt on Fear 
        Factor because it is so appalling to Americans can have a grave impact 
        on Pilipinos and Pilipino Americans. My aunt, for example, is &#8220;offended 
        that [Americans] are grossed out because only rich people eat [balut].&#8221; 
        Thus, in a society where Asian Americans, especially Pilipino Americans, 
        are minorities, it can be difficult to feel accepted when media such as 
        Fear Factor portray Pilipino culture in a negative light. On the other 
        hand, it is also hard for Pilipino Americans to have pride in a heritage 
        that is ridiculed by popular television shows. Young Pilipino Americans 
        might be determined to shun their heritage because they are ashamed. Finally, 
        Pilipino Americans may be led to believe that what they see on television 
        is true &#8211; that their food is disgusting. In a recent issue of Filipinas 
        Magazine, public health doctor Ofelia V. Dirige believes that &#8220;we 
        have weird foods that turn people off.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        My main purpose is not to make people stop watching Fear Factor, but instead 
        to challenge everyone to view shows and other media such as Fear Factor 
        with a greater awareness of what the show may symbolize on a deeper level. 
        It is important to understand that a program may be portraying someone 
        else&#8217;s culture in an undeserved way despite its entertainment value. 
        So, next time you&#8217;re yelling &#8220;Ewwwww!&#8221; at Fear Factor, 
        just remember that your next-door neighbor might be enjoying that same 
        food at that moment.</p>
