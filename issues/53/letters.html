<p class="fineprintheader">check-in from sweden</p>
<p> Hey,</p>
<p> I stumbled upon something good.</p>
<p> Me myself is living in Sweden - some of you may actually know where it&#146;s 
  at - and I am a soon to be a graduated journalist or web programming rat, whichever 
  comes first.</p>
<p> Anyway, I liked this a lot though I probably ain&#146;t your typical reader 
  (no kidding?). </p>
<p> But that doesn&#146;t mean you don&#146;t write about issues common to Swedes 
  (or anyone). Suddenly I&#146;ve remembered what I love about internet.</p>

<p>I am glad that you have the courage to tell the truth.&nbsp;This country is 
  evil and hypocritical to the core.&nbsp;The very group who rule this country 
  ought to be overthrown and deemed traitorous.&nbsp;Good job patriots and keep 
  it up.&nbsp;I will fight along with you in my own way.</p>

<p> Hey I just wanted to say good job on the latest HB.&nbsp;I really liked how 
  Pilipino American issues are being addressed more and more.&nbsp;Thanks to the 
  writers of the 3 articles and to hardboiled for getting these topics out.&nbsp;Seeing 
  Pilipino Americans represented in hb made me want to read ALL of the articles 
  in hb, which I did (I usually don&#146;t).&nbsp;I hope that hb&#146;s staff 
  continues to do a great job.&nbsp;You guys got my attention.</p>

<p> I was slightly disappointed with the review of 36 Views that appeared in the 
  latest edition of hardboiled. I reviewed the same play for the Daily Cal and 
  I gave a much more critical rendering that your writer (Jack Song). Here&#146;s 
  the link. I thought it was Orientalized hogwash. </p>

<p> Happy New Year of the Horse! </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your generous review of Sweatshop Warriors, for taking 
  the time to come to the East Wind reading and processing what the women&#146;s 
  stories mean to you and hardboiled&#146;s readers. Know you&#146;re busy attending 
  to other projects so I really appreciate it. Good to see the paper&#146;s focus 
  on asian community issues &amp; struggles.<br>
</p>
<p> Wishing you much success in life &amp; love &amp; peace in the coming year,<br>

<p><span class="fineprintheader">Skinhead love</span><span class="fineprint"> 
  | &#147;God Save the Queen&#148; hb 5.1</span></p>
<p>I came across an article that you printed called &#147;God Save the Queen !&#148;, 
  from who knows how long ago.&nbsp;I just wanted to say that it was great.&nbsp; 
  I&#146;m an East Coast skinhead doing my PhD at C.I.I.S. (California Institute 
  of Integral Studies) in S.F. and doing a paper on the history of the skinhead 
  movement.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the (m)ass media always talks about the racist 
  skins, and very rarely does anyone hear about the non-racist skins.&nbsp;But, 
  you really nailed one of the main problems for British skins, that being the 
  N.F.&nbsp;The Pakistani immigrants were the first group targeted by the first 
  skinheads, who ironically enough were Jamaican immigrants and white British 
  ex-mod dock workers. </p>
<p>I guess I&#146;m rambling, but I just want to say that the article is great 
  and that I&#146;m going to be using it in my paper, and although skins get a 
  bad name, I hope that you have had met at least one sharp (skinhead against 
  racial prejudice) rather than all boneheads (racist skins).&nbsp;So, keep on 
  rockin&#146; in the (paid for) free world.</p>

  | &#147;Do You Speak English?&#148; hb 5.1</span></p>
<p> I was just surfing the net, and I guess I just stumbled on this site.&nbsp;What 
  really got my attention was the article &#147;Do You Speak English&#148; written 
  by Kevin Lee in hardboiled 5.1.&nbsp;Because I am also an older sister of one 
  of the Asian American youths that was a part of the incident. </p>
<p>The feature of this article took me by surprise because I didn&#146;t realize 
  that there were so many people that were aware of what happened.&nbsp;I was 
  so shocked myself when my brother told me what had happened to him.&nbsp;I never 
  would have thought that this type of racism ever existed in Seattle because 
  I have never personally experienced any type of blatant racism against me.&nbsp;I 
  was not only angry, but I also felt that it had major negative effects on my 
  brother and his friends.&nbsp;He started to distrust anyone that wasn&#146;t 
  Asian or Asian American, and also began to become very anxious near Caucasian 
  policemen.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I have been really impressed at how the APA community in not only Seattle, 
  but nationally as well, in handling the situation.</p>
<p>Well, anyways, I just wanted to say thanks for featuring that article in your 
  mag!</p>
<p>P.S. The two policemen involved only received a suspension for &#147;misconduct&#148; 
  and NOT racial profiling . . . Although he implied that he had &#147;killed 
  people&#148; like us during the Vietnam War . . ..</p>

<p>Dear hb,</p>
<p>I just want to comment on how much I enjoy reading the article written by A. 
  Chang. I am in complete agreement with her viewpoint. In fact, I am interested 
  in sending one of my papers I wrote in graduate school about the media&#146;s 
  portrayal of asian americans to see if hb wants to publish it. </p>
<p>I found the articles in hardboiled very informative and important for the betterment 
  of humanity. </p>
<p>Thank you . <br>
  Sincerely, <br>
  Sam</p>

<p> Could someone kindly let Burt know that we (Samoans) don&#146;t consider ourselves 
  Asian or Pacific Americans.&nbsp; Nothing against our Asian brothers and sisters, 
  but if you look up every article where a Samoan pro football player talks about 
  himself, you&#146;ll find references to his Samoan identity and culture, maybe 
  references to Polynesian or Pacific Island roots, but never Asian.</p>

<p><span class="fineprintheader">SWM seeking Massage Parlor contacts</span><span class="fineprint"> 
  | &#147;Bay Area Massage Parlor Expose&#148; hb 2.3</span></p>
<p> First of all, i thought Richard Lee&#146;s Bay Area massage parlor expose 
  was outstanding. Please tell him so, and any other reporters who had the temerity 
  to venture into massage parlors and query prostitutes.</p>
<p>I&#146;m pursuing a similar story, the only problem is that I&#146;m in an 
  area where these places would NEVER exist. Yeah, right. San Bruno and Millbrae 
  are crawling with Karaoke joints and massage parlors, but this is Suburbia and 
  very few people are willing to admit that we have a problem, let alone talk 
  about what it&#146;s like to operate around here.</p>
<p>I&#146;m wondering if you established any Peninsula prostitute/massage contacts: 
  Redwood City, Daly City, San Mateo, etc. Not surprisingly, I&#146;m striking 
  out left and right. From what I&#146;ve heard, the local Karaoke joints are 
  very provincial, and if a short white dude walked inside the music would stop. 
  Did you guys do any research before you headed into these places, or did you 
  just walk in unannounced?</p>
<p>I think if I&#146;m able to do something similar to what you guys did, it would 
  make a compelling story. But to simply hear from cops and experts just wouldn&#146;t 
  make much of an article in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Any names, #s, pieces of advice that you are comfortable giving would be greatly 
  appreciated.</p>
