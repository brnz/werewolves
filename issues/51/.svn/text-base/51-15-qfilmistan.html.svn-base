<p> If you haven&#146;t heard of QFilmistan, don&#146;t panic. It&#146;s not one 
  of the &#147;stans&#148; that&#146;s been causing so much anxiety in this country 
  lately. Being first Queer South Asian film festival in the United States, QFilmistan 
  featured shorts compiled into 90 minute sets with themed titles such as Sex 
  &#145;n Fantasy, Travel log, family, icon, and Naval gazing, Nasal Piercing. 
  Taking place in the Artist Television Access in San Francisco, QFilmistan provided 
  a distinct space allowing for discussions of Queer South Asian identities often 
  marginalized by mainstream queer film festivals or South Asian film festivals, 
  and in the process expanded the traditional scope of the labels &#147;Queer&#148; 
  and &#147;South Asian.&#148; The great variety of themes included in the festival 
  is quite impressive considering the financial limitations that many of the filmmakers 
  have to work under. </p>
<p>For a first festival featuring films from the subcontinent as well as the diaspora, 
  Qfilmistan included surprisingly diverse pieces ranging from very serious, dramatic 
  to playful and silly in tone. Some films even pushed the limits of this new 
  genre by addressing topics beyond the Queer and South Asian identities. As expected, 
  not every film was great (for example, the festival wouldn&#146;t have lost 
  much by dropping the hour-long documentary on Freddie Mercury), but there were 
  gems in every section. Among the best were &#147;Jareena: Portrait of a Hijra&#148; 
  by Prem Kalliat, &#147;Letter From Home&#148; by David Kalal and Gita Reddy, 
  and &#147;Summer in my Veins&#148; by Nishit Saran. &#147;Jareena&#148; was 
  a 25 minute look at the life of Hijras, a community of males or hermaphrodites 
  (some of whom are castrated while others are not) who take on a third gender 
  and perform special social roles; they live and worship together, traditionally 
  providing different services for their communities. For lack of a better word, 
  &#147;Hijra&#148; is often translated as &#147;eunuch&#148; and is classified 
  as &#147;transsexual&#148; in Western social sciences. The film follows Jareena, 
  a Hijra who, in order to avoid bringing shame to her biological family, dresses 
  and acts like a man when she visits them. Jareena and the other Hijras in her 
  community explain through their stories and their celebrations the religious 
  beliefs of their order (the Hijras form a religious order with its own internal 
  social structure and myths, though Hijras can be Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or 
  any other religion), their daily activities, and the process of joining the 
  Hijra community (including the decision to undergo the castration). Despite 
  the fact that there are thousands of Hijras throughout South Asia, there is 
  not very much unbiased information about this very oppressed group, who gernerally 
  are portrayed as freaks. This film attempts to look honestly at the life of 
  some Hijras and begins to examine the reality of the order rather than relying 
  on misunderstandings, exaggerations, and Hijra-phobia. </p>
<p>&#147;Letter from Home&#148; is a monologue in which the actor, who lives in 
  England, dressed in women&#146;s clothing and attempting an older woman&#146;s 
  voice, reads a letter from his mother in Pakistan expressing fear and unhappiness 
  about his sexuality. Among other things, the film addresses the misconception 
  that homosexuality is somehow Western and the tensions that can arise in transnational 
  families that split between the subcontinent and the diaspora. </p>
<p>&#147;Summer in my Veins&#148; also addresses the difficulties among long distance 
  families as it chronicles one summer when a Harvard student Nishit travels through 
  the United States with his mother, who still lives with the rest of his family 
  in India. Throughout the film, Nishit tries to gather the courage to come out 
  to his mother, whom he obviously loves very much, before she has to return home, 
  with the added pressure of not knowing if he is HIV positive (it turns out afterwards 
  that he is negative). While the idea of chronicling a summer vacation has immense 
  potential to be trite and sappy, Saran keeps it &#147;real&#148; so the strong 
  family relationships come through clearly and keep the audience interested. 
  Also, the film is full of very humorous moments, not the least of which is the 
  very last scene, after the audience learns that Nishit does not have the HIV 
  virus, and the words &#147;Now I just have to find out how to show my parents 
  this movie&#148; appear on the screen. </p>
<p>Qfilmistan 2001 was a good coming out for what hopefully will become a more 
  popular movie genre, the Queer South Asian film. </p>
<p>Qfilmistan was organized and put on by Trikone, a support group for Queer people 
  of South Asian heritage. </p>
